Despite having multiple friends etc the warehouse still fills too fast and i waste time hoping fir something to happen so i can use up something. Don't talk down to people you want playing your game. That's why I dropped it to 2 stars. Warehouse fills too quickly and then cant expand because i dont have the fire crystal things. Also am going to reach level 20 (level cap) before i really get to do anything fun in the game. Very frustrated about that."", ""Meh. Warehouse space is limited even with upgrades. The amount of times I've accidently clicked something I didnt mean to..and used the fire gems afrer a week of saving to get 7 for an unlock. Just meh, the game would benefit from having a way to get firegems more simply. Space upgrades from quests, or cheaper gem purchased versions. Edit: I'm well aware of the game mechanics, I'm simply saying the values of those mechanics are not great. From someone who used to help create apps."", ""I love this game but it's a real downer how much they milk you for money, they make it so you have to spend money to advance in the game...other than that, the Dragon races are fun especially if you belong to a clan that's friendly and talkative. Edit: decided to quit, I dont like the answer they gave me..it feels dishonest and I've seen it repeated ...Mystery Tag you just lost a customer."", ""Every update makes the game less enjoyable and ridiculously difficult and seeks outrageous amounts of real money. Racing is not fun anymore. Also the lucky coin is rigged...no it is not random . I haven't had a x5 since last August so don't reply with your stupid generic replies about the randomness or that the game is mostly free to play. And latest update made the subscription button so big compared to loading button. Cheap tactics👎"", ""Stop fuzzing every 10 mins. Impractical system, no ways to sell items except to other players. Some things need ridiculous amounts of gems to force ppl to waste real money. I'm 40+ and I can't see how games are worth wasting real money on. Those of you who do, are you addicted? The fuzzing makes me set the score lower than my true opinion."", 'It takes too long to fight trolls and build buildings. By the time you have finished doing either you become bored with the game. Graphics are great though.', ""Edited review: I really struggled at first, but after spending a bit more time playing & the developers' reply, I now understand the game to be very strategic, rather than just adding up produce. It requires thinking & stock movement. I still struggle a bit with some of the finer details, but I'm enjoying it even more now that I understand how to play. I'll keep this game going. I'd like to see easier access to explanations & befriending others in future. Good job, developers!"", ""*I wish there were a little more prompts to help players learn all the capabilities of the game. For instance, I didn't get the 'helping friends' part until I accidentally tapped on the green gift box. And I still don't know for sure about the vouchers.

I like that there's a lot to do!"", ""A subscription is coming out of my account but not getting any subscription. I have contacted the developers but never seem to sort any problem you have out. They ask you to send receipts which I did but will never give you a refund or sort your problem out.

Please don't listen to the reply them asking me to contact customer support because I have and they still have not sorted it."", 'Its really fun to play but as you get further stuff takes longer to build or make Really need and option are you sure you want to use your purple gems ive spent over a hundred on accident on stupid actions i didnt want', ""Really fun and you can play without purchasing things. I don't mind spending a little here and there but it sits better when I don't have to! If they add a confirmation before spending gems to finish battles early, I'll change it to 5 stars. Several times I've tried to give weapons or armor only to have it spend my gems instead."", ""It's fun to play and I absolutely LOVE my OTR teammates but definitely need to fix the game balancing issues. Love the fact that you added 30 new levels and added more items to previous shops. We were all stuck on level 90 forever so this makes HL fun again. Our only issue now is really with the relic balance. We're being asked to do carts of 76 Vanilla, 80 Cocoa, etc... Even with 1/2 battle we can't keep up with relics. I started out with 100+ relics but now it's 0-6 max. It's IMPOSSIBLE!!!😭😭"", ""This game is very deceptive. You work hard to collect items only to find that they are gone. Everyday I get back to being able to kill the next monster then the materials disappear For NO reason. Gems also disappear. Do not even consider spending real money here because if free stuff goes missing I'm sure the same will happen with purchased items. Fraudulent company alert. It's a game. Why would you suck the enjoyment from something that isn't even real? What do you have to gain by stealing???"", ""ADDICTIVE~FUN~little challenging to see if I can get what I'm wanting. I think things are over priced and it takes to long to construct things. The higher level you get the higher costs and longer time. That's a downfall in my opinion. I think cost of subscription is crazy, not everyone can afford that, so you'll lose players. Ya catch more flies with honey than vinegar, just something to think about. As for game itself... AWESOME"", 'I absolutely love this game. But what do you do when you at the highest level, have all your buildings, have a super cool clan, do 1300 points every week? The super cool rewards you get from the race means nothing as you have so much relics, amulets, gold and crystals and got nothing to use it on. Where is the challenge in that? Why keep on playing? I need a challenge or a change in game...', ""Addicting, but not very well explained in the beginning about your inventory having limits, & about how to see what you have! It is very time consuming, because the builds take forever! You need diamonds to do things, & you do not get many generated from the game. They expect you to buy them. That's the only down-fall...... I still really enjoy it but it isn't something you can sit and play for long, like I said before! But being a single mother, I don't have a bunch of time to play anyways!"", ""Game is fun, but basically impossible unless you pay $$$. Thank you for replying but not the case, I used play points to move up, but your subscription is pretty much the only way to get the game to be less frustrating. I'm aware of freebies and the management of storage, but it is pretty impossible. Sorry, honesty."", ""There's a bunch of issues I can see. I just downloaded this game yesterday but already lost all of the starter diamonds because if you accidentally double tap on a work in progress if you want to see how long it'll take for example, it'll spend them. There's no confirmation button which would be an easy fix or at least a different placement so it's not dead center. Other than that, I've only placed a couple buildings but the waiting time is already up to 8 hours"", ""Its fun, but frustrating. It costs so much to build that requires a lot of materials on top and in that case u run out of barn space... therefore u have to update that. Also it can cost u a LOT in gems. And u dont get much of that back. When u need seeds, u get little bushes that hide behind great big trees or buildings... thankfully, u can move buildings even when they r being built, but the big trees??? Nope... also the build take over 24 hours or more same with monsters that's in ur way."", ""Don't buy gems! Mine keep vanishing randomly. When I contacted support they said they were used fighting monsters which isn't true. Must be a glitch in the system, don't waste your money. As I expect I got a response blaming me.. I was on the app myselfnwhen the gems vanished right before my eyes!! I was picking Apple's then over 500 gems vanished. I thought this had happened previously too but as I didn't see it I ignored it. This time I saw it happen and contacted support and got blamed!!"", 'This game is very beautiful and I admit I was enjoying myself. However the rate at which you can progress is very congested. Everything after the second zone requires a ridiculous amount of gems to do. Even cutting down a tree costs a large amount of gems. Granted you get gems faster by paying a subscription free. The fee though is way more than even full blown MMO costs a month. Not worth it!', ""Fun but too hard to advance because they want you to buy stuff. Edit* Sure you have free options but it takes FOREVER to earn things that way. I can't advance because I need more storage and to expand but they both cost gems that are RARE unless you buy them. If I'm lucky, I may ear one of the rare gems but you need a ridiculous amount of them, not one."", ""This game is money hungry, more so than other farm games. Main critique is that some special items needed for buildings and to unlock parts of the map are extremely hard to get. The merchant that sells them comes around every 6 hours and I've been waiting for days for the item I need. It's possible to buy with gems, but gems are better invested in permanent upgrades like production slots on buildings. Graphics are great and everything is interactive. Fun but unbalanced. Room for improvement."", ""The boxes that pop up on everything to spend your crystals is a tactic they use to get you to spend your money on the game! Many times all my crystals get used up without me even realizing it until they're all gone! And I have bought crystals!! But no more! I will not spend another penny on this game!!!!"", ""Great Game ! find the right clan and it's super fun.they need to make it easier to earn crystalsand make more coin decorations we can buy."", ""Love this game, however...once you begin playing seriously it COSTS to play. Additional race cost. To play with the gnome costs. Buildings cost. I spend on average 20$ a week, plus I have the subscription. We are currently in the top 30 globally so I think it's worth it,but if we weren't, I wouldn't spend that. Just be forwarded...this game is not TRULY free to play."", 'Tech support is non effective to take care of issues. Getting the run around continues! The worst tech support and glitched game to date ! I would not suggest playing! Since my spouse and I started is when hacking attempts happened between our Gmail and fb accounts!!! Above all they called her abusive all Bec she stated need issues taken care of! We have screen shots of their abusive and none cooperation!!! How they treat their players . Free game indeed , help you only when a casher period .', ""This is a great game, however you never get any of the fire amulets. It is always the blue ones. You need to use those fire amulets to upgrade your storage and if you are able to upgrade it only gives you ten more spots. There should be an option to upgrade storage with diamonds or coins. Especially since you need the amulets to get into new areas. I feel like I have lost interest already because I can't do much, which is to bad because I would like to keep playing."", ""This game would get 10 stars if it wasn't for the fact that the wherehouse fills up so quickly that I spend most of my time determining what I need to ignore and what to put away. The bottomless wherehouse option is $10 a week which is absolutely ridiculous. I wouldn't mind paying for an upgrade but not at $40 a month. I'm pretty sure most people will uninstall within a couple days just due to this. This game could be fantastic :("", ""Ok. I have been playing this game almost 2 years. I lovED it. The 2nd to the last update with the new buildings higher and then the drawings was hard to swallow. But us devoted players swallowed and continued to hang on. But this time... This upgrade is absolutely ridiculous. Programmers really messed this one up. Oh and it is not just my opinion it is the majority. I can't believe you want us to use amulets and relics like water to create items we need to fill orders. If we have an order of 10"", ""This could have been a great game if it wasn't so focused on premium currency. You are very quickly stuck, all warehouses full, and you cannot sell (or delete) stuff from your warehouse without using diamonds. You also cannot upgrade it for more space. I am only at level 13 and I am completely stuck because my warehouses are full. I can't get rid of them unless I am lucky and a boat comes with an order that matches what is in my warehouse. It ends up being a lot of sitting around. No fun."", ""I think the games pretty good except ,the fact that I'm still stuck in the second section because I can't get all the gems to upgrade my storage, I have tons of stuff all over the screen and can barely see it. It is all produced and just sitting. Its making me lose interest in the game.I'll give it another day but I'll probably end up deleting if I can't get any father by tomorrow. I can't even make ordersfor the boat sitting there because I have so much in my stock."", ""This game started out really fun. Hours of play time, no energy required to complete task. But now of course the game is almost at a standstill. I've spent a lot of money to move forward with the games and never receive the red amulets. It has gotten completely expensive takes too much time and workers just to build the buildings and kill monsters. The store is way too expensive to buy good. 10 diamond for 1 egg. EVERYTHING IS WAY TOO EXPENSIVE AND ITS FRUSTRATING. I'M LEAVING THE GAME.😡😡😡"", 'Could be nice but not balanced well. Or just geared heavily towards having to pay to keep playing after few levels. You quickly run out of storage (10 item storage farming game warehouses!), cant gather enough and sell enough to earn IG coins to progress... quickly game becomes pointless without payment for quite a bit of things to continue. And the costs - omg....800 gems for upgrades is a 50% off lol... heads up you guys - game is not THAT good to justify the kinds of costs player is facing.', 'I enjoy the game. But gaving to use jewels to buy almost evry thing is just wrong. Earning jewls is hard and unless you Pay growing is very slow. Using coins for upgrades would be great. And the price of a subscription? Wow. Up to $20 a week. That is nut. Drop it to $5 a month and you would make a lot more.', 'The graphics and concept are fine. Sadly, the game quickly became absolutely painful. Three types of inventory space must be expanded separately using specific combinations of magic crystals that are hard to get in a targeted way. Build and task times for your workers become lengthy very quickly, and building costs scale too much. I\'m sure these problems are fixed by throwing money at the game, but trying to play free is miserable. Also ""Your villagers are crying for you"" is manipulative.', ""Very enjoyable, almost addictive, with very nice graphics. What I would like to ask the developers is to introduce the possibility of cancelling an order/ task in the game by paying with coins (not diamonds). There's been a few times when I've accidentally touched something and sent my workers to a task that consumed time, resources and workers, with no possibility to cancel it. And when we talk about 2 days, 3 workers and 3 fire amulets that are very hard to earn, this is annoying. 😊"", ""It is SLOW moving in progress. You need these gem stones to upgrade you warehouses which get to be a pain to collect. It's luck of the draw in hoping one of the birds or bunnies you feed or a monster you kill (both come up by chance) drops it. And the fire/orange gem... good freaking luck getting it. You can spend diamonds to get but those aren't super easy to come by. Once you get past the basic building stage, it is also hard to get materials you need for new ones. AWFUL!"", 'So far, I am enjoying this game very much. I like the quest-like shipments and cute animations. However, when you call something ""Bottomless"" this means it has no bottom, no end...clearly the developers missed this. I will not be renewing my subscription. Waaaaay too expensive. This game is a money grab. Unfortunate.', 'as an app developer I never played a game but this is the first one that I played longer than 1 hour ! , the option to play free is awesome now I am at level 42 ... it is challenging sometimes but is fun ,good job team ...cinema does not work lately .. but still fun..']"

I don't even want to think how much money I have spent on this game to have to uninstall it completely and find some other farming game!"", 'I downloaded and started playing this game just thinking I could play a few minutes and get my daily reward points and then I got hooked on it.

Downloaded latest update andy tablet crashed on and installation never completed and when I go cell to use I'm being taken back to the very beginning of game. List everything and I refuse to start farming from beginning. Help please tell me what to do to restore game to level on. Ive spent to much money in game purchases not to be able to play. Please have not farmed since update."", ""I wish there was a warning not to go ahead but I guess that's how you get people spend. Now it is freezing since yesterday in the chat so I'm getting over it fast. I've spent too much time on this to just let it go. Maybe if they update it I'll come back."", 'Awesome game. The problem is the news feed does not work. I ask neighbors for stuff and when I go to get it the app errors out. I dont like I hVe to ask neighbors for help to complete missions. Please fix.

Put your Guest Center at the path you already created for your dog. Otherwise, since it's not a grid system, your paths won't match up AND YOU CAN'T MOVE PATHS AS LONG AS YOU HAVE A PET AND YOU CAN'T REMOVE YOUR PET. Huge design flaw.

Make it to where we can earn the money instead of having to spend so much."", ""I actually enjoyed playing this game even though it's incredibly expensive. I still played it daily until I switched phones and lost my farm completely even though it was supposedly connected to my Facebook.

I had to start over, even though I had played the game for 5 days. Make sure you follow the tasks and not just play around like I did to start out, it hurt me. I sold a part that I needed for a machine. This is the first time I have played a game like this, I love it, I just made a newbie mistake. I started over this morning and all is going great and having a wonderful time!', 'As long as there is no adds and pay to win in the first place i will keep playing it for life! please dont change that. I just have little suggestions what could make it more interesting. I think we should have option to harvest neighbours trees instead of just fertilizing and in mystery store for a green ticket there is amazing stuff we can buy, but i would like to see also some items for island farm. I REALLY LOVE THIS GAME, its perfect, lot of things to do. God bless person who created it.', 'After the last update I dropped all the way back to level 17. I was well over level 50 and had a lot of time amd energy invested in this game. Now all my progress is gone', ""Was totally addicted until I reached level 50. Then It stopped loading.

I guess I have to find another game to play."", 'It\'s a fun game. Relaxing. Family friendly. Until. . . . . . . You get the video ads. You watch the video ads for bonuses.

Let me give you a quote from one ad my son and I started watching ""ouch, how are you going to punish me master?"".', ""After updating I can't load the game.. now I can't play this game.. what is the problem?? Please fix this problem 🙏🙏"", 'Love this game! Variations with ocean, pets and games and competitions make this a non-boring game.', ""I like the game, and don't mind the quests, however some tasks require RC (green money) to pass it, and the game doesn't allow you to get them quickly. I can maybe get 2 a day, and some things require 6 or 7 for one item and the same for the other. It's really hard to move up. I have 5 tasks that I can't move forward on because I can't get the banana tree or the items to finish a machine. Just wish there were more ways to get them. I love the unlimited barn space. Crops take too long to grow."", ""While I do love this game. It is becoming to be to tiresome. It seems all the acheivements require you to fork out money for the game. And the lab. part of the game makes not one wit of sense. You level is the game says you get to open more seeds. So you go check out the seeds and they tell you to level up. Then the part with the big bunny it tells you that you can't do anything if your not a leader and don't have level 1. It says that you can chat too. But that is a lie. It freezes up."", ""UPDATE!!!I FIGURED OUT HOW TO FIX THE GLITCH SOME GAMERS ARE HAVING WHEN LOADING GAME!! THIS IS FOR ANDROID. I was unable to get a resolution from the contacting Family Farm Seaside. I figured it out by myself!!!!!!!!!! Go to settings>Connections>more connection settings>reset network settings> then select reset network settings. I Can't load game getting internet connection error message I've spent so much money on this game and now it doesn't work wow I want all my money back!"", ""Really good game I love it. Would of been one of the best games I've played if it wasn't so expensive to play I get you want to make money but you need to at least give a bit more back to the players who play and pay. The trees you need to do quest some need to be paid with notes only game becomes unplayable. Other then that it is a enjoyable game"", ""Lame. Prepare for a long introduction for a super simple game. It's the same farming game everybody makes."", ""It's a good game I really enjoy it. Has as many glitches and bugs as you'd expect. The missions are getting really annoying because you can't complete them without spending real money. There is the option to earn/win 'RC' to buy things but it is imbalanced with the amount you need to complete the game. If not for this I'd happily give it 5 stars"", 'While I love the game it seems that you down load a new update version too much. I have tried several times to download the new updated version and it says something about my phone not compatible. I am now out of all my money that I have spent buying RC and different things not to mention me loosing my level that I was on. I am very upset I really wanted to continue playing and moving on thru the game. This is heartbreaking....', ""I loved the game until this last update because now it won't open and let me play! Plus half the time when I try to open it it drops the game or freezes on the home page and I can't get to my farm to harvest anything! And I know it's not space that's the problem as my phone has over 66GBs left on it!"", ""The more I play the more disheartened I'm getting. The games far to much to play, all main events take RC to complete for one thing or another. Other quests evolve trees or machines that take RC to buy. I've only got one quest that doesn't require RC to complete so far. The RC in question costs quite a bit and it takes forever to get rewarded any. I know there's the option to be patient and save the RC but the game would become boring very quickly."", 'Very good game, I never leave reviews but this is hands down the best farming game on the app store, good job developers', ""If you have any OCD-esque tendencies or need things to fit together nicely, DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS GAME. While it runs nicely enough and seems fun, the game doesn't function properly when moving items around the farm. It physically wouldn't let me move a farm plot into a spot (an empty perfectly available spot, no less). Nothing fits together, and the lack of any sort of grid when moving things is probably to blame. I would not recommend the game."", 'Costs a small fortune to play. Almost everything costs real cash. A lot of the challenges require an item purchase to complete. There is a slim chance of randomly get free RC to make game purchases, as well as when you level up. I downloaded through Mistplay. I will definitely delete this app. Farmville, Township, and Sim City Build It are much better options.', ""Let me start out saying, this game is very fun and addictive. I've met some amazing friends in this game. The graphic and the animation of the animals and the machines is marvelous. But this game has gotten very GREEDY! Here is the one main thing that makes yall look very GREEDY. When I spend my tokens 2 spin and I open a chest and it's an RC item and advertise that item for yall in my market then I should get the rc credit not just to get coins.If land on it I should get it. I spent my tokens"", 'I like this game but it takes a long time to load and it has too tasks to do before you level up. The beginning configuration is too long to load and checking the barn it adds too. Also when visiting the neighbors it takes some time to get back . Also when using the e-mart if there are some other people who you want as neighbors it should allow you ask them more than 1 person. Please make the game quicker through these issues. It would make this game more fun to play . I would edit my revie', ""Brilliant game until the last update. Now I can't claim any items I've asked friends for therefore I can't complete tasks and progress"", ""Love this game. Always something to do and keep busy! I've logged in daily since starting this game!"", 'Im loving it. Just please dont upgrade it like other games like pay to play games, Like items and etc.']"

I just REALLY HATE when you first open the game(every single day) that it has like 10-15 things that pop-up and you have to close them before you can get to the game itself.

I'm not sure if I like it so much now especially starting all over like I had to."", 'The pluses: Gameplay is a bit more interesting with the new craft buildings, however the game does not allow you to store or sell buildings, pets or animals you no longer want. The cons: Seemingly literal zero support. They no longer reply to emails or provide any forum gameplay ticket support. I have no beehive because my account is that old, and in all these years they have not made it purchase-able @ market to old-timers like me. Newstand full of items not needed, upgrade items are scarce.', 'It all went well and just as i started to enjoy it the game just crashed. Popups keep coming up every second and refuses to be ignored.

Disappointed!', ""This game started out strong and I was really enjoying it! However as you progress you need specific tools to do the basics of the game like expanding, building, clearing land, etc. The problem is they don't make these widely available so you can only expand so much unless you buy the tools for gems. Currently the only way to upgrade my barn is to use gems, which ALSO aren't widely available. Farm Story basically corners you into buying their gems if you don't want to get stuck eventually and you need them for so many things! This game has so much potential and would be fantastic but it is too expensive to play..."", ""I like the game but expanding is a problem and i can't delete or restart the game.

I have been playing for 3 to 4 years now. I don't want to start over. Why am I allowed to sign in on both devices with the same log in But still have to start over on the new one? This really sucks!"", ""It was a fun game up until level 14. When I hit level 15, I will quit. This game is absolutely ridiculous. Level 14 bombarded me with so many expensive buildings that I needed to buy in order to create new products to sell off that fulfil the new delivery orders. Problem is, I can't afford them and had to keep recruiting for new orders to deliver because they all required buildings I don't have. I've done this about three times now and still getting new orders that I can't reach. And deliveries are the only reliable source of income in this game, as you can only sell something on your online shop every 6 hours or you have to lay up some gems. So I'm basically stuck when it comes to cash, and converting gems to cash is a really bad idea as gems are valuable and need to be preserved. That said, product deliveries should be based on what buildings you have on your farm that you can create those products with not what level you are on. If this was the case I would boost my review to 4 stars, but it's such a big issue."", ""Love the game but it needs new updates and I don't LIKE HOW IT WONT LET U SELL OR REMOVE CERTAIN THINGS LIKE THE CORNUCOPIA OR THE ANIMAL HOUSES.. STARTING TO HATE IT NOW!"", 'the game is nice , but when it comes to getting all the collection items , like in the around the world you barely get any of the cards from the sugerspinner , and the nextoneis the bakery and then the deep fryer and then the dary , no problems with the others and the last thing I want to say is I finished getting 4 filled in the collection and was supposed to get the flying squirrel and all I got was a poll with a red flag on top , were is the flying squirrel? and how do I make the food in Mill', 'Still has a few bugs to work out like some items can be retrieved when Barn is at Max but others you totally loose. Neighbors farm show 12 items for sale when they only have two or none. The train upon completion only gives you 5 Gems, should be more especially on the complicated ones that you have 2 or 3 different items that are done in the same area like the kitchen. We should be given more Gems throughout the game.', ""I just finished ALL 10 items for my train but the last, 6 Lily candles, only show 3 on the train. I've tried 3 times to write to support so they could fix it and I would get my 5 gems. Looks like that won't happen because I can't seem to get the link to work. I don't have much faith in a game if I can't get help if I need it. Just because I use an android tablet instead of an I-pad doesn't mean I should be treated like I don't matter. All Storm8 games cater to I-phones and I-pads. Those users get the better prizes and decorations. Bet THEY can get help when they need it! I have played this game for a long time and been frustrated many times, but kept playing cause I really like this game. But having a 'glitch keep me from getting the gems I worked hard to get might be the final straw. Maybe someone from Storm8 will see this and contact me. If not then it was fun while it lasted."", 'so many gems you\'ll never get back. One wrong swipe& you spend all your gems on something stupid like making an orange tree ready for harvest. I\'ve had 100+ gems wasted on things I DID NOT WANT. if you email for support, they\'ll just tell you they can\'t credit gems back;yet you could buy them. I\'ve been saving gems for a show pony since I got the game. With all the accidental purchases I\'ll never be able to.

Standard waiting game where every action requires either time or and item involve. If resources are not readily available, the player has the option to buy via ""Gem"". Get ""Gems"" by farming or flat out pay with real money Standard boring miscrotransaction. Biggest problem long term issue, there is not delete button for excess items. There are many complaints about it on forums. See for yourself. Devs won\'t listen.', ""Great till it's not. I used to love this game, but I don't receive notifications again on my phone about what's happening on the farm. Sometimes I'll miss my train leaving and stuffs like that.

Animal Village Rescue,com.herocraft.game.wonderwood,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.herocraft.game.wonderwood&hl=en&gl=us,"This game will spirit you away! The magical village is a mess and all of the cute creatures have disappeared. These little animals need your help! 

• <b>The uniquely magical atmosphere of a fairytale wood.</b>
• <b>A huge menagerie of cute birds and animals.</b>
• <b>Endless gameplay.</b>
• <b>Clear the mess and decorate the landscape.</b>
• <b>Unusual buildings and a deep ecosystem.</b>
• <b>Even the evil critters are cute!</b>

•• <b>Important! We use the """"""""""""""""Device ID"""""""""""""""" permission to keep track of in-game analytics.</b>


The creatures require a lot of care but you'll have great fun growing special food for all animals and building homes for them. So banish the critters, clear the weeds, and repopulate the glade with animals. Then decorate the area, collect resources, feed the animals, and make sure their homes stay clean and cozy. 

Some animals will only fall in love if other animals are present, or if they’ve been washed, so make sure everything they need is to hand. Thankfully, a few hardworking Gnomes can build you all sorts of wonderful devices and buildings.

Delightfully designed and animated with kind humor, the Animal Village Rescue is a fairy tale garden for you to make your own. It's not tough work though as the hardy Gnomes will help you. You just need to relax, enjoy and take in the wonders of the Wonder Wood.

But this app just does not work properly. It bugs a lot, there is no option to send my own clothes as a gift as it used to be. I cannot photograph my looks. Cannot enter and buy clothes from fashion shows as I cpuld when I played earlier. I could even buy clothes that my neighbours are playing. I could also visit stores of people that are the best in MallWorld and not only our neighbours( none of my fb friends plays it anymore).. I wish there was more options', ""I love this game, but there are a few problems. One of them is, even you still have many space to hang the clothes, but the red colour appeared, showing that I can't hang clothes anymore. Also, when scrolling screen from left to right, it always accidentally pick on a cloth even though I am not intended to pick it. Lastly, I appreciate that there's a lot choices we can choose especially for background of the shop, but somehow it seems annoying and quite hard to compare the one we like. Thanks^_^"", ""I've played this game for a really long time but there are some things missing that I hope to see back! Starting with being able to create outfits for friends and get to buy them, add more delivery slots, options to sell clothes, have my pet on the app and dress them, and also I want to subscribe to VIP but it will not let me do so on the app. I buy alot of credits and spins but want more outfits to choose from and more stores! All in all I love this game but want more."", ""I give this game two stars because I can't enter a fashion show it says there's a problem every time.I can't watch the ads for the free tokens and coins also because you can't search though the options of clothing. If these issues are resolved this game would have 4-5 stars."", ""Same review as everyone else. I used to play on Facebook, but this app version sucks. Doesn't sell your clothes, auto buys items while you're trying to scroll, too few choices, tiny shop. I'm really disappointed. I recommend Fashion Story. It's an oldie, but goody. Can't believe so many people complaining about the same thing, but developers aren't fixing the problems with this app!"", ""I remember playing this on a computer when I was a kid so I excitedly downloaded it on my phone the instant that I saw it. I still have the data when I've last played it so there's no problem there but I hope that you can make a mall that sells Japanese, Korean and Chinese clothes especially their imperial clothes!! I have a love for them so if it appeared on the next update I'll be very delighted!!"", ""Previously, I gave 4 stars because I am fairly satisfied with the game but now I gave 2 stars because when I bought dresses in the catalog, it wont show up in the inventory and it's a waste of money. I was having this problem last year and until now it wasn't fixed. I am so disappointed because the money I spend is more than 500k and I just lost it."", 'This game is good and everything been playing it since facebook brought it to me but the only issues i get every once in awhile is when i start to change my model it will go back to the same clothes that i had on her already and its annoying please fix that little issue thanks otherwise love this game :)', ""Too many bugs. Not nearly as good as the Facebook game. Free ads don't work anymore."", 'The app keeps crashing and saying ""something went wrong"". It\'s also not very clear how to make my way around the game.', ""The Free spins is not enabled at all. It's been inactive for so many days."", ""I can't collect the money earned. I don't know how to make friends or become VIP. There are a few more little things. I do enjoy this game, but there are improvements that should be made."", ""It hangs and it has a bug.. and sometimes its not working... i'm a fan of this game ever since 2010 so I hope it will improve"", 'I totally love it!! 😍 Alway5 stars away 😍. Can you please add more lipstick and Blush too please. ☺ Can you please add outfits that we made by other game? Please.', 'This game is so much fun! I really enjoy the different styles of clothing and getting all dressed up.', ""I think graphics are very beautiful but fashion show is not working we want to participate but it says not enough model that is why other players doesn't play and i also uninstall this game"", 'It doesnt run on Facebook. It barley runs on my phone. the team needs to fix it. I still love the game', ""This game hasn't changed since last I played. I was 19. Now I am sixty six and I still enjoy it!"", ""it does load properly you can't see what you look like once u change it mmoves slow needs major updates"", 'Slow game needs lots of updates', 'Good but it wont let me collect the money from the cash register', 'This game isnt as fun as it used to be its hard to buy and stock things', 'Less sales per hour and most of the time no sales at all. Meaning no earnings. How can we play if we cant sell? Boring and bad game.', 'Love this game but how do i get another floor currently have 2 and would like a 3rd, any help?', ""The app simply doesn't work like it should. The entire concept is too poorly planned, with bugs through the whole game and so many mistakes from the makers of the game. It is just so silly and sad that nowadays everyone can create a game and not have an idea how to do it properly. There are sudoku games that run better than this one. Have a talk to your tech guys and either them fix the game or just delete it, because otherwise it is just painful to play the game. I give it - 100/5 stars."", ""The experience is the best. The experience is the worst. I don't know which one to use to describe it. Try it for yourself."", 'Honestly, not like it used to be You should bring back all the old features or even new features and this game would be cool.. i miss this game !', 'I will give three star because I remembered this game haha lol. I remembered playing this game when I was a kid in my computer. I am really addicted 😂 And I am so happy because I saw this app here. Thank you because I can play it again.', ""I had played the desktop version for many years until it stopped working for me; a few days ago I started playing this phone app, it's been fun up until I tried to browse through the store fixtures. My only major complaint and that is that when I go to shop for displays, shelves, etc. for my store, while scrolling, it is next to impossible not to accidentally purchase things you never meant to buy, there's one display hanging out on the floor of my store that I can't remove because there's a shopping bar that covers it, plus I wasted money, including credits that I never wanted to spend, it's very annoying, unnecessary stress. Please work on adding a shopping, storage, and deliveries menu with an arrow to make the menu go up and down so we can get to the floor, and an option to decline an accidental purchase, something like a box that pops up and asks do you want to make this purchase, because honestly, I'm afraid to go back in there and shop because I don't enjoy wasting money, be it game money or real life money."", ""The game is fun to play on computer only. It always has so many problems in the app, like you can't see the doll's clothes, or any items received in the WoF, which is really annoying. I reinstalled it but the problems are still the same so I decided to delete the app. Hope it's fixed soon cause I also prefer playing on phone. 🙃"", ""Loved this game when played on Facebook, so was very excited it was a mobile app! The app is upsetting though, I've had to uninstall and reinstall numerous times because when trying to decorate my store there's no 'confirm purchase' or similar so I'm constantly buying expensive stuff I don't want and wasting all my money and gold and needing to restart. That's all for complaints though, still love the game besides that!"", 'really like the game, but it will be better if when we dressing up our player we can zoom the face so we can see the make up we\'re using. The game have way too many bugs, like i can\'t get my money from the cashier, eventhough i touch it many times, and also when you\'re trying to put some stuff, from the stock room or storage they wont appear, and there\'s a writting ""something went wrong"". And also i can\'t enter a fashion show because there\'s not enough models. pls fix it soon.', ""I played this game back in the ancient days of Facebook. I cant believe it's still here and playable. The game always had issues, some of the clothes dont actually go on your avatar, dont load in, can't place them on a rack or shelf, having to close the game to get it to work properly, fashion show clothes almost never ever show up on anyone but your own avatar, theres features that freeze etc. It needs a massive overhaul in all areas"", 'This game is cool clothes are dope wish u could do more games instead waiting around to get paid to buy things so its kinda boring been a user for yrs n its different n better on computer vs app', ""I played this game when I was little on Facebook and I loved it. But this app version? It's a joke... When your not in-game, it's supposed to work in the background and sell off the clothes in your store. Well, this app does not. I don't know if it's a glitch, if i'm the only one with the issue. I started up my store, left to go to bed and got back on the app the next morning, none of the clothes were gone! I made no money that whole time! Am I supposed to be on the game all day everyday?????????"", ""This used to be my favorite Facebook game back in 2012. Only recently I found out that it's now available in Android as well. I started playing it again after 5 years. There are so many malls, walls and floors decorations available now that it gets tough to keep swiping. So the developers should work on simplifying it and also unveil the option of selling the old items from the closet. Because some of the items look like trash now and most of us would want to get rid of those."", ""idk if I'm doing something wrong or what the problem could be but when i go into the app all it does is stay on the initial screen with the mall world logo and the music playing. this is so disappointing. i absolutely LOVED this game years ago and always wished they'd make a mobile app for it. now that there is one, i can't even get it to work. will change my rating/review if it decides to ever start working."", 'I love the game. I play everyday. I just need to find other players that like to play the games so we can send gifts to each other and watch the fashion shows and vote on our clothing.', ""I can't get back to ANYWHERE from my closet when I go to ge a different look!! Very frustrating!!! I contacted help & support and they never replied. I absolutely love this game but some things need to be fixed! wheres the broom to clean uo fo more energy? And how do you buy more slots for delivery? Where is a place for all these questions?.???"", ""I tryed to send these issues to the Help and Support in the game but it goes to a blank page so im hoping you can just fix it. The game was good untill this last update where you added fashion show when opened there's nothing there even the section that says join. Can you please explain how that part is played NEXT the closet what happened now my character is way way too small and I'm using a 7inch screen tablet not good at all You fix these issues and ill give the game a 5 star rating Thank you""]"

I enjoy playing it but there are quite a few bugs that need fixing. When a friend buys something from your truck it takes forever to update. Sometimes u can also buy an item multiple times by reseting the game. A public event popped up in game for an event in 2018??? Umm hello we are in 2019. It would also be nice if you could rotate your buildings instead of everything facing the same way. PLEASE UPDATE THE GAME & FIX THE BUGS! The last bug fix was in Jan 2019...needs an update ASAP', 'Nise in the first few levels and than the waiting games starts. It takes hours to make something. If you want to buy it from the market, you dont get what you want and have wait sometimes for days. I am at level 42 and its now one of the most frustrating games i ever played.', ""i mean i love the game, no questions about it. it really is nice. The features were great, awesome and addicting, the only problem here is that it's already 2020 now, yet the last update of the game were still on january 2019. Could the developer update it in time atleast? Thankyou."", 'I loved this game until it stop detecting my internet connection and now everytime i open it, i get a message for acess to my email and then goes blank....

It is a little glitchy but ok', 'Good game. I will give it 5 stars when there is more ways to add friends. Also keep getting error messages saying im not online when wanting to ask for help.', ""1 star is actually more than it deserves. The controls are horrible. Accidentally touching something can take away all the gems. My biggest issue is that when your barn is full & your truck is at the market, you are at a standstill if you don't have the items needed to upgrade your barn. After playing it & realizing this, I tried uninstalling, clearing cache, & reinstalling; it reopened where I left off instead of starting over. Therefore, I am still at a standstill & probably deleting now."", ""This game is highly addictive and amazing. My one issue is, if you make one mistake, or if your hand brushes the phone. In one click you've spent all your diamonds on something you didnt want. I wish you could confirm before it takes away. I've wasted a hundred diamonds easily on upgrades I didn't want."", ""Won't let me start the game. Says no connection when im fully connected to internet. Uninstalling."", ""It is a good game better then most farming Sims but a major problem is no option to sell goods from storage for really low price as most do..so if it full u have to wait for it truck to come bk & what if No1 brought anything from it u r fully stuck til then..that's where I'm at now so please sort this for a 5 star rating..thnx"", ""I really like this farm game! It's smooth running."", ""My go to for time killing that is JUST behind Township. Great graphics n there is always something to do. My issue is trying to fill the ship and trains.

MP FORCE I think you team need a update for this game because of the 3d effect the drop and drag system of the game suck it takes time and exact place of my finger to dropped in proper place and about the shop system can we just put the item not 1 by 1 because it takes time to go back in store to buy again the same item', ""I really like this game, BUT the only thing thats made me uninstall this is when you're clearing log/trees/grass etc it takes WAY too long!

When will The Island on right side be expanded. Some change would be nice because it's been the same for a very long time."", ""this is a cool game until you run out of water then it becomes VERY BORING. You need water to make stuff so you can never get the tank filled. IF THIS PROBLEM IS SOLVED I'LL THINK OF REINSTALLING. I HATE LIMITATIONS IN A GAME."", ""It's okay, but it's difficult to clear lands and also to get coins and diamonds. Please fix this."", ""This game is fun and challenging.

Your Hyper Hippo Comrades.","[""I kinda thought this was a dumb premise at first, but I'm hooked. It's a fun game that is ad supported, but not overwhelmingly so. The balance is good enough to keep me growing potatoes. Edit: Still a good mindless time killer, but higher levels become increasingly idle oriented. Push buttons for 5 minutes, then wait 4 hours for results. Events can be fun if repetitive."", ""It's a good game well sort of. I think I'm just at the stage I've invested so much time into it I just keep playing. ***I think you should introduce a reasonably priced get rid of ads item that's the only thing I'll pay for*** Once you get around level 60 or so it will take you several days to over a week to complete levels if you're f2p as a heads up I'm at level 77 now and it takes me around 9 days to complete a level. I'll assume soon enough it will be 2 weeks."", 'Not as good as the prequel. In the previous installment, paying for stuff was optional and was not necessary for a decent progression time. I mean I like that there is optional adds to support the devs and get something out of it but I am really upset about the progression system. Previously you just had to invest into a certain resource producer to upgrade them. Now you have to farm this weird science currency and cards to be able to upgrade and it ends in unfun grind.', ""Been level capped since November 3rd. Made in-app purchases only to find out I could no longer play/advance in the game. It's been almost three weeks and no new levels added. Wish I could get a refund or credit to use on another game I can actually play. UPDATE: Stopped playing for about six months. Now that I am back, there are plenty of levels to complete, and I am enjoying the game."", ""The latest update for this game broke it. Can't even launch it it gets stuck on the loading screen. -_- Edit 2/10/20: Apparently the reason it freezes is because it's asking for latest version of Google Play Games app which I do have. It works even if it takes a few tries to get past that prompt going to task manager. The game itself is fine once it loads but this nuisance is annoying at times. Back to four star til it gets fixed."", 'This game is fun but after level 60, it really bogs down. It takes a long time to level up after that and oddly, since only about 20% of ads load, it takes even longer than it should. Ads not loading (you get a cute, ""check your internet connection"" message like that could really be the problem) is ESPECIALLY bad during special events. What, you DON\'T want me watching your ads?', ""I really like this app. There are no intrusive ads, and if you want to watch the ads, they reward you with boosts or extras. This concept of game can be very addictive so beware if you have a problem with addiction. It is also pay to win but not necessary. It can be a drain on your battery and data as well so be cautious. It's rare to find an app that's this honest and not slimy with advertising. All glory to communism!"", ""Repetitive.. Simple.. Is alright Update : Still playing it.. At lvl 43 now.. It's still alright. It does not force ads on you,.. You can chose to watch adds to gain an advantage.. I like that approach... You can also but stuff... But it way way overpriced.. If I could spend 1 euro I might buy once in a while.. But it 10 euros for basically nothin..."", ""This game is not like other idle games; definitely keeps my attention. For me, leveling up is not so bad. I love that I can basically go to sleep and wake up able to upgrade or whatever. I also enjoy the variety of events and love that the same events come around. Doesn't feel redundant at all. Also, the Comrades behind the scenes were able to help me when I changed devices but lost my data. I appreciate them helping me and even giving me back some of my progress. Thank you much, Comrades!"", 'Have been enjoying playing this game for a long time, the updates that have come through make it interesting to keep coming back. However the latest update has Incorporated new ads that do not load so I can no longer get bonuses which does free me from continuing to play. I hope this will be fixed soon and allow me to come back.', 'Games ok but the ads are broken. They routenly take several min to load and often crash the app or time out causing you to not get the reward and wast my time. I mostly play with great wifi so the loading is on THERE END. Also you get the same few ads all the time and you have to watch the whole thing. Also the ads are constantly getting longer and more anoying. 10-15 sec ads are tolarable 60-180+ second ads that take 5-10 min to load and play and then crash the app are infuriating.', ""it's fun for a while, but it gets progressively slower until progress is almost non-existent. the events are fun because at least you can progress faster during the first couple of days, but they get slow too, and the rewards you earn don't help your main game all that much, even if you rank in the top 10%. I quit and uninstalled at level 23, but you may enjoy it longer or quit sooner."", ""Edit: prices got higher. Now i will never spend a single penny again. Be careful with this game. They had become heavily greedy. After spending lots of money, I realized I was being fooled. The events are not balanced anymore, so it's nearly impossible to beat at max level, and even paying, you end up spending more money than you would if you just bought the prizes. Don't be dumb as me. The game is fun indeed, but it has became a money grabber."", ""Phenomenal for a few months. You eventually reach a point where comrade production is really behind and you end up just waiting days between logins just to drop comrades in a certain spot. The weekly events are where all the fun is!!! I've been playing for a long time and the biggest thrill is that 4 day marathon of timing different strategies and trying so hard to reach level 20. My record is level 18."", ""It's genuinely the idle tycoon-style game I've been looking for. It's lots of fun, and plus, Communism! EDIT: Honestly, a researcher that starts you after each rank up with one of their productions would be great. Perhaps some of the higher levels could unlock this, so that you don't start over completely? Other than that, maybe some way of displaying airdrops without covering the objectives screen? Just some suggestions, totally earned a 5 star review, just hadn't played enough yet"", ""I like the game but it is not perfect thats why I'm not giving 5 stars. I think the creator/s should change a few things. I don't have any specific details but I think others might have had a worse experience then me. I have only been playing since yesterday, so I can't complain. Other then that, it is fun."", ""The game itself is an amusing distraction, but the ad network is a raging dumpster fire. It becomes unavailable frequently, but even worse, does full video ads. These video ads are either not compressed at all, or are in a format that is breaking the display system. They crash. They hang. They get stuck loading, and make you wait several minutes before they finish. Heaven forbid you're not on extremely good wifi. This game should be renamed: Ad Network Crash Adventure"", 'I left a review telling them that their ads are broken, as they literally crashed my entire phone repeatedly. I did this because I had already tried all the troubleshooting they recommend, and had tried to contact their support through the app. Their solution? Have a bot close my support ticket despite my issues being unresolvable, and reply to my review telling me to use that bot-broken system again. Horrible support.', 'This is a great app and I love it so much I got to rank 44 but I tried to get on and I just keeps me at the loading screen even If I uninstall and reinstall it still stays on the loading screen, please fix this and it would be great again. I am back to say that the app works again and its fun!', ""Pc version has been abandoned for several years....... Mobile version removes propaganda boost on events every now and then despite still having several hours left. No remove ads option to buy either. Very disappointed. Edit2: the problem is not the ad. The unlocked time on the boost just goes poof despite having at least a hour or two left..... Besides. No remove ad purchase option? Being able to remove those would do wonders to data usage! It's such a standard offer too."", ""I will edit this review to be 5 stars when ads stop glitching out. It's always the 30-second video ads that automatically go into horizontal view, they stop playing at 25 seconds and the only way to fix it is to close the app and reset. It's a great game; I'd love to give five stars, but ads that crash the game are unacceptable and really killing my desire to help playing. Edit: yeah the in app support is pretty hot trash too."", ""Well... Starting with the positives you guys have hilarious youtube ads, kudos to the marketing team, they really made me want to play the game. Besides that it works fine, no bugs or anything but tbh it's really underwhelming. Much like how the communists go through life, you'll go through this game: mindlessly. Not much thought required. Just press the buttons. No skill and little strategy needed... It just not my thing."", 'Addictive in a good way. You constantly get rewarded somehow, be it points, chest or characters. I have played for almost a week now and at no point felt like I needed to spend money to progress or keep up. Even during a ranked event spanning a couples of days, I manage to be in top 30% without spending a single dime. A good choice for an addictive idle game that surprisingly keeps on giving 🙂', 'Watch the lines move to the right, and press a button to make them go to the right again! Actually it\'s much better than most others like it with weekend mini Events that change a bit. You CAN ""pay to win"", but you don\'t have to. It is Ad sponsored, but it says so clearly in the title! No surprises there. The humor is a very welcome touch too and makes the game for me. One negative, doing the 3rd party quests (using other apps through a 3rd party) don\'t always pay off', ""I'm happy to report that the ad issue seems to be resolved as of 2/10/20. Have had several days without crashes. A fun way to spend time, the art is creative and the gameplay addictive. The weekend special events are a lot of fun and they're consistently adding new ones! Been playing a year and the game has grown a lot in that time."", ""Been playing it for few months now. One of the few games where you don't mind watching ads because you benefit from it and not in an annoying way for 5 min. Frequent events make it more fun as the higher you level up, the longer it takes to do some quests. Also like the new feature of more rewards ☺️ I am level 47 right now"", ""Hands down my favorite app game ever. The only ads are optional for rewards, the concept, animation and characters are hilarious and the events are based on percentage instead of straight rating so it's still weighed in the paying players favor (as you'd expect, why shouldn't people who pay have an advantage? ) but not to the same extent as other games. Greatest state has produced greatest game!"", ""Very addicting, although, I don't really know why. It's just very satisfying to play. The only thing I can complain about is the base game gets pretty boring, but the limited time events kind of make up for it. Without those, I probably would've dropped the game a long time ago."", 'Really fun game! I previously played AdVenture Capitalist and really enjoyed that one as well, and while this one took a minute to get used to, I enjoy the game more as time goes on and I get further along. Worthy of my good rating and a long review despite my extreme laziness...', ""Pretty cool game, with the ability to save online. Progressing fast. However, free gold amount is useless, you're either going to use gold a bunch by purchasing more, or not even think about it such as I have. UPDATE, Gold improved, very happy with results."", ""I'm currently rank 37 in the main game and am enjoying the pace of ranking not to fast and to slow. I wish the events were less pay to win though becuase without spending money on the game you can get a good placement on the leaderboards. Leaderboards shouldn't be based on who spends the most money."", ""When the 'help chat bot' acts like an AI but is just a poorly scripted command prompt... Had issue, went to help. Followed help, didn't cover issue. Continued to follow help, then asked what the issue was... The issue I had to type in to get the thing working... It's a time waisted, decent enough. Doesn't break any new ground and totally a pay to play setup."", 'I loved it, the events were fun, the ability to earn what you need in game. Everything was fine. This last update however the ads freeze up, you loose all the items and double time you try to earn. Even your plane benefits are lost due to frozen ads. Please fix it.', ""What the heck have you done to the event quests? I'm currently trying to 'collect 720 yokai' which cost 1.0cc each and I'm not even close to making 1.0bb yet! I do really enjoy this game but you've broken the event quests horribly... Also, science adverts in the normal game... Why at level 62 and a minimum cost of 8k per upgrade am I still only getting a poxy 120 science when I watch an advert? That bonus needs to scale with level... I'll update my rating if the issues are resolved."", ""For what it is the gameplay is fine.... But there are serious bugs in the ad service that they use. Video based ads (more so than interactive money game ads) you can't cancel the video ads (not even when you wish to for go the 'reward') and it can take 5 or more minutes to load a 15 second clip. Tried different WiFi networks so it's not a local issue. To the developers find a different video ad service or at least debug it."", ""This game is awesome! Its very fun and it appeals to me since i'm kinda a communist. The dev team is active and always listens to suggestions (and sometimes even address the reviewer as 'Comrade'). So far for me, no bugs or glitches!"", 'This is a fun ""idle"" game if ever there was one. It\'s more than possible to have fun for free, but you can speed things up with paid content. The gameplay cycle has you restarting frequently, but you get to carry over tech and other progress so it\'s always a fresh experience.', ""Would really be nice for a game that's Purley based on adds for them to actually work and not cause lingering circles waiting for add and make game freeze. At level 78 u really need add bonuses so it don't take there weeks to make the next level.. instead of changing game how about making it work and function first. Then expand on that ... An elementary school level idea to change a not fully functional game and adding to it so players experience goes down and one quits playing."", 'Great game I really enjoy it and love the events, the only thing I would add to the game is some kind of bonus for the events with the level or cards we already have on the primary part something like that, that can help us finish the events.', ""Feel like they remove cards from availability durring tournaments, not sure if it's for everyone or just those that don't buy in but has happened to many times to be bad luck. End of the day it's fun to play but will never buy in to a rigged system.""]"

I don't know how to fix it and if anybody knows please tell me. This review is going to be one star for now as I believe other people experience this problem and we need a fix, thanks. After we get a fix, I will rate this high and share it with my friends, I just want to get playing this amazing game again. Thanks."", ""Even if you are bored you can't stop forever from this game, it makes you come back again and again.. Best game to play if you like to play casually and hardcore but doesn't have that much time to stare at your phone every second. Strategy and wits also needed to compete in tournament. Best game I ever play and keeps coming back although after being bored again and again."", 'This is an amazing game. It starts out simple and hard to progress, but after a few days it gets easier with each prestige. At my point, it is a little bit of a struggle but i can still get through. With artifacts, heroes, gear, armor and prestiging, it makes it fun and it makes you want to keep playing. This is a great game where you get to choose how you want to play by upgrading your skill tree. You can choose your class and each class has special properties. I highly reccomend to anyone.', ""Honestly. I've gotten fed up enough with this game and the developers. I've spent nearly $3k, and have played it for over 1150 hours. I used to love it so much, but now it's no longer fun. The developers have confused RNG with skill, and a single multiplier or a simple cosmetic as content."", ""Similar to the original TT, it has an error that tells you there has to be connected to Internet to download updates, even when I just downloaded it and I'm online. So sad, because I remember it was and awesome time spending game, better than a 5-star review. But since I cannot play it because of this error, 1 star. Fix it and let me play and I'll may change that score UPDATE: I just uninstalled and reinstalled the game. Now it works"", 'I gave this 5 stars previously. The game is a great time sink with multiple reasons to enjoy it. Yesterday after patching the game to its latest update i was flagged for suspicious activity. When i sent a ticket to find out why they replied i was accused of using exploits. While i have no idea what exploits exist for this game i feel the copy paste form letter is an insult. . Crappy customer service who are too lazy to fix thier mistake. Dont download unless you plan to whale. edit- The acct was banned for nothing. the ""support"" said it was an exploit. Never explained what ""exploit"" said i was higher ms than I was supposed to be. reset my acct from 7k ms to 100ms and that was it. Never cheated, no clue how to cheat on this. no explanation, just took away hundreds of hours of play time and locked my acct. I stand by my updated review. dont get this game. its a time sink that they will delete when they feel like it and blame you. I truely believe if I\'d spent money and not used the buffs given by fairies and watching the adds for hours total exclusively I wouldnt have been banned. The mods response is exactly what I\'d expect it to be. cover their own broken auto detection software and blame the user.', ""Played this game for 2 years.... Horrible, horrible, horrible moderators! They don't do anything but ruin the game with every update. It's just become a cash grabbing, time wasting, piece of garbage... No matter how hard you try, you will never win a tournament, because, guess what? There are cheaters in the game. If you report them, they won't do anything about it, because they simply don't care. I will be deleting this game for good this time, and everyone I know will do the same."", ""Reinstalled to see what is new and see not much changed. Instead of using a app to do my artifacts I've just been randomly putting in different levels. It is a good time waster but I hope that it don't burn a imagine in my phone like last time. Took over a year to get to 10k+ and the game has a learning curve to knowing what to invest in the skill tree. Without a guide that tells you what to do or how to push. You just randomly level skills and artifacts."", ""This game is very fun. You're able to buy upgrades, buy heroes, customize you're character, and also buy power-ups! The gameplay is also very good the graphics a great, and it is very easy to control. Overall If there were a tenth star, that's how much I would rate this game. Keep on updating, and making the game better! 1😁 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"", ""Good game and a great time killer but every time I log back in my previous data isn't saved, I tested this a few times like I do about 200 stages then reopen the game and my data isn't saved and I have to redo everything and get my heroes back."", 'The crafting menu and the daily deals should be affected everytime players taps the fairy that gives spending spree, and players should receive more then 10 crafting shards when crafting power has been leveled up, and on top of that, add 10 crafting shards for each level. eg. Level 2 crafting power gives 20 crafting shards every week.', 'Its a cool game. I like the graphics and everything, but at the point I need to prestige, it says my account is blocked. Its also not letting me tap anything else, so I cant do anything. Please fix this. I wanna keep playing.', ""Hats off to the creators. Sweet, sweet balance of reward vs time engaged..hell of time not engaged. You don't treat players like we're stupid and you provide high quality gameplay with something as elusive nowadays as integrity. You kept it real and because of this you're so successful and will continue to thrive."", ""This app deserves 5 stars but I'm only doing 1 because it keeps forcing me to rate it every 5 minutes. They need to do like other games an make it an optional thing, like if you rate it you get gems or something."", ""Fun, simple grind forever game. I don't know how, but they've done something to make the eternal grind to get better worth coming back to. It rarely changes, but it's still fun."", 'It is great but there is one problem. I cant get into a clan unless I am on stage 100 but on my old phone I was able to get into a clan once I reached stage 25.', ""Wouldn't give this game at least a star but I couldn't because I can't post it here until I gave you at least one star.. Last night I was in level 350 up something then upon opening this game today, I went back to level 1. How could that happened though I have my account registered."", 'This is a great way to kill time. A direct upgrade from the first game. There is no tutorial so you gotta learn the ropes yourself which makes it even more fun.', ""um what does the all hero damage mean on the robot light saber 🤔 plz tell😊.while I was playing the tournament that gives you 100% multiple fairy chance, the shadow clone broke when it was done and I saw it still going it only had the slashes from the sword it didn't even do damage plz fix it."", ""The game becomes irresponsive randomly sometimes. I'll be able to select the tabs at the bottom, or close an opened tab."", 'Great experience, got up to level 1.2k+ this is very good I recommend it to everyone who sees this review, instant 5 stars, everything is perfect, the pets are great, everything about this is great!', ""This game is awesome.. It's addictive and a good time waster and its easy to get into. Upgrading it easy also everything about this game it awesome. Keep up the awesome work tap titans 2 team"", 'this game is wonderful with or without spending money! one of my favorites of all time for phone apps. Even if I get bored for a little while I always end up coming back soon after for more. would rate higher if possible. If you spend $50 over time (not necessary in 1 transaction) you can skip ads and get rewards immediately from fairies which is useful. I love that it accumulates over all transactions.', ""It's a great game I played the first one and got hooked on the first no ight I prestige 2 time at level 200 too 300 so once I found out about Tap Titans 2 i freaked so i really suggest this game."", ""I really like the game but hey can you please fix this bug because every time i got in stage 400's my screen automatically black out. Can you help me?"", ""It's a very great game, but not gonna lie the recent adjustment has made it harder to go to stages because of how expensive the new prices are."", ""The game is good, story is good, I rate it 1 star as the Traditional Chinese translation is awful. So much error. I reported to game support and they don't seem to care. I can rate back to 5vstar once it is fixed."", ""This game overall is 10/10 because of the grind to get the best possible items or finish the events its an overall pleasing experience.you don't FORCE ADDS *COUGH COUGH*voodoo *COUGH COUGH* .keep up the good work"", ""Good. If you've already gone through a level the screen shouldn't go to the cutscene. It's a bit annoying"", 'The game is actually not a game. Just a cowclicker that gets to a point where you will need to spend money to move forward. There is no skill involved. Just wasting time. It preys on people with additivity problems.', 'This game is fun to play but the one issue is you have to esaned constantly and it takes a lot of time to but all-in-all great game recommend play all ages.', 'Its ok. Clan features and skips and portals are cool eveythings better than the original except for the major offset that the offline dosent work properly. I was off for hours but no offline coins, and the leveling feature while offline through skill tree is to complicated and not worth the invest. All in all id say awesome try but you barely missed the mark on this one', ""More fun than the original (and that's saying something). Leveling is far easier and you feel like you're actually progressing."", 'Excellent job on a classic tap tap game. System to improve is very large and makes the game incredibly competitive', ""The game is pretty good. I suggest you don't make a comparison in the add because it's weird. Anyway awesome game!"", ""Fun game would've been better if you could upgrade your stuff and pets becouse there are low chances for your item to pop up in the shop"", 'Absolutely amazingly awesome. Very addictive with the right amount of adds. Very enjoyable.', ""Very fun and fair idle game but since I've started playing a week ago and ads don't work. They worked for a brief few hours one day and never again. What's nonsense is I click the videos to get rewards or bonuses but because the ads do not play like they should you're unable to receive these rewards/bonuses. If this problem is fixed I'd rate higher but it's been almost a week with no word about it except for the devs telling people on the subreddit it's a problem with the ad provider."", 'Loving this game. I do have one suggestion that would be great. Artifact leveling up, obviously I know you can select between 10X 100X and 1000X level up but I have a few that are quite far behind, is there anyway that I can ""hold the button down instead of tapping it."" I just cant sit for hours trying to use all my artifact points to level 1 up.', ""I have played this game and the first tap Titan for almost 2 years now, this game is amazing, and the only thing wrong is that it lags a bit sometimes, but that's my new tablet, it lags on everything, thank you so much for creating a tap Game that is good,""]"

We've tuned your favorite game with general optimizations and whacked bugs so you can focus on the good stuff: pimpin' up that Pawn Shop!","['Its alot of fun. Learning how to spend wisely and save!great game', 'I love this game, but have deleted it TWICE now because you get to a certain level and the challenges stop, basically, on your orange cell phone, that is. I am still worling through some outrageous ""requests"" from the green phone, which i can never seem to get done, I cant find the objects they are asking for. I really wish you guys would fix this game, I LOVE PLAYING IT, and would have to have to uninstall it, because this time, I wont install it back.', ""Good game, very fun! Extremely addictive. I play almost every day. The graphic are eh But hey it's a tap it game right? Simple to use. Basic controls. Only issue I have with this game is the energy. The energy takes way to long to regenerate 🙄, Ive been playing is daily for about a week now. I'm literally only level 6 do to wait time on energy regeneration. cmone guys why even add energy to a game like this to begin with? Please either take it out or decrease regeneration time!!!!"", ""This game barely conceals its greed until you start to have some fun. You either have to pay or put up with a 30second ad for every 30sec of game play. I'm a day into the game and Im already at the point that if I want to make any inventory expansion I have no choice but to pay cash. Sorry but Ive encountered types like this before, this kind of greed is endless"", ""It's fun but, there are buildings that are useless, like a old college can be used to see how much they are worth, however they won't let you pick an item to use. So besides the occasional malfunctions like how I just explained, it a fun business game"", 'Great, addictive game, shame u only get 3 plays per day. My only question is what do you do with all the money that you earn theres nothing to spend it on ?or have I missed something?. It would also be great if there was some incentive to win gold bars or to upgrade the car or something to make it even more addictive to play! Love the game though!', ""Game is nicely and good for play,but it's just a single problem... I'm try to update and nothing it's happening so I'm uninstall and reinstall again but he dropped me from beginning,all my 26 lvl was done even lot's of money I've just gotten and now everything it's loses,can be fixed this problem please?"", ""Fun and addicting app at first. But you run out of quests quickly, and are limited to only buying and selling. Game has become very boring. I keep waiting for new missions but nothing. I don't know if the game is finished, or more things to do are on the way. It would be nice to know either way. I would like to purchase the gold bars to make the pawn shop better, but don't want to spend the money if the game is over."", ""Cool game except that to upgrade your pawnshop, ie: shelves, space etc., your vehicle or anything takes gold bars and you don't earn many of them. You can earn alot of cash but you can't do anything with it except bid and buy storage units. So you get to a point where your stuck in the same old rut of buying storage units then selling that at ur pawn shop and then doing that over and over unless you buy gold bars with actual money."", ""I love it! However now that I've been playing for few days I ran into its glitches; you loose volume without reason or when you watch an ad to reduce the time for the appraisal in the college. But if you don't mind restarting your app every time than you're good. Unfortunately for me it will get old soon enough and for that reason I've edited my original comment and yet for the third time I'm installing the game yet again, I can't help it I really enjoy it despite any flaws it may have! Thank u!"", ""I'm only a new player but so far I am enjoying it a lot, there's no annoying mini games to get cash, you can watch videos to get decent rewards and it's genuinely fun to play and keeps you coming back, only issue I have is the sound randomly goes off and I have to close to game and re open to activate the sound again. (it doesn't work in the options) Apart from that so far it's good."", ""Alot of fun.l like these kind of games.passes time easily. Only problem is it gets locked easily and freezes or kicks you off. Now, more, problems.Theres nothing new, it seems the only way to get anything, is to pay for it. It's to hard to get anything,the way it's set up now. Anyway, it seems like you guys quit on the game. If you ever do anything with it, let me know. thhl"", 'This game is fun. But the ads are very irritating. Just after you finish the auction and store to your inventory you get an add. You go to the college or library and then u get an ad immediately. I am fine with an ad for some upgrades and stuff. But in general ad just for clicking each time is irritating. I dont need to switch off the internet each time to play this game. I am right now at 60% irritation level on this just after playing for one day. I will uninstall once it reaches 100%', 'It\'s fun and corny at the same time. However, too much time is spent watching ads and only getting one gold bar and no new auctions after level 25. The Avatar ""Mutt"" keeps saying, ""new stuff is on the way"", and I have not seen any yet. Time for sales at the Pawn shop could be quicker, too.', ""I am really enjoying this game, it's challenging, you have to make wise decisions in order to keep your pawn shop going or you will lose money and pay the cost. I wake everyday ready to play again, so it keeps me coming back. I can recommend this game, I am learning how to make money and deal with my customers and what it takes to run a pawn shop, so download it and play it for yourself. See what you think...thanks again..."", 'Fun game to play but expensive. After $20 I feel should own the game or at least not be nickel and dimed to death. Waiting 50 minutes to do one auction is way to long of a wait and I loose intrest then I end up playing a different game. Maybe if I let it run in the background a few days I might actually get somewhere.', 'Im out of new quests for weeks now, and the one quest i have is impossible to complete. All these weeks and i have not been able to find the soldiers letters. I have played several times in every auction, and still cant find it which leads me to believe this game is bugged. I will give it until the end of this week and then i will delete this game. I am level 22 and for the past 10 levels i have had nothing to achieve apart from that 1 quest that is impossible to complete. Do not recommen game.', 'Fun game so far im level 14 and making great cash So far so good. If i did have one complaint is that is impossible to win a locker and stay anywhere nead the starting bid price .You just never really get a real ""big score"" kind of locker its jusr all low end and middle of the road so far, ohh and the constant add. I could do without that. Otherwise than that its pretty good .', 'Its a great game however to speed things up you have to pay or grind away. On avrage you get about 20 minutes of game time then have to wait a few hours. Not to mention the never ending stream of adds.', 'Well I have only played a few days at the moment but it has drawn me in nicely.A good little buying and selling game for those who are interested in that kind of thing.The characters seem interesting and the game itself is easy to learn and play so,all in all,I have no complaints.', 'Great game exciting and fun just like the tv show. Only problem is the sound went off and every time I go to switch it on in the options it switches itself off again, other than that great game for a budding dealer like myself miss the sound though', ""I love this game really. It's just that sometimes the sound goes in and out. But I love this Mutt character. He's really sketchy 😂. Keep up the good work, but get the sound thing fix and we're golden"", 'Once you reach level 18 the objectives and chalanges stop. Seems like you are just passing the time by attending auctions and selling in the store. Doesnt really seem like there is any purpose after that. To upgrade cars or inventory or extra shelves you need to spend stupid amounts of gold bars, which also does not seem worth it.', 'I like the concept of this bid wars with the character voices. However, this version stinks! The original bid wars has infinite energy periods, dumpster diving, and a Christmas update along with treasure hunts, daily and weekly auctions with rare items. This version needs a serious update and a whole lotta love! Will be uninstalling until the designers can get their head outta their ass and make this version just ass good as the first one!', ""Not gonna lie, I had my doubts. I can see it MIGHT turn out to be a pay to play but I give this rating with that in mind. It seems I'm doing ok up to level 6 not struggling in anyway. I do wish the selling was a bit more interactive. But again, I'm not far into the game and it looks like there's more to unlock soon enough. I'm looking forward to it."", 'The game is cool if you like shows like ""Pawn stars"" and ""Storage wars"", BUT my major issue with this game is that your saves are tied to the device you\'re playing on. Even after connecting with Facebook on both devices there was no syncronization. Lucky I didn\'t spent money cause I read you also lose you\'re purchases. That\'s a big MINUS for customer support from the developer/s hence the 1 star review.', ""This game. Is a lot of fun for those fans of the storage wars phenomenon. However I'm up to level 38 and haven't seen any new features for a while, it would be great if the developers could get a wriggle on and do something for us established players."", 'Ok... First I will say this game is very realistic. Its just very stupid to have EVERYTHING cost gold. The storage units, objects, etc should be able to be reduced and you should be able to obtain powerups by watching videos. Just sayin. Overall a decent game', 'A lot of ads which slows the pace. My sound wont turn on for some reason, it actually helps to hear the bids. Would be better if more time to view the unit before auction, also if your early bid actually forced the other bidders out. Basically you just wait till it says going twice, then bid, and you get the unit.', 'Love the idea of the game, only downside is if you want to get more shelfs, boot space or storage space you need to buy gold bars. Should be an option to buy them also with money that can be earned in the games or unlock them if certain tasks are completed', 'Could be good if you add more buildings and features. the collect 200 common items is impossible because it doesnt tell you what you need at the end of bid, the mission symbol shows on common itemss ive already collected.', ""Fun way to pass time not just when bored but weather waiting on dinner waiting on appointment or if you're anything like me just gaming and selling for fun and strategically learning how to negotiate money lowkey overall a great app and game even though they could give more free gold bar opportunities and shorten the amount of bolts it takes to play each auction this game would be #1"", 'Good basics but constant pestering and endless 30 second ads (mostly the same hemp crp) start tl grate. Will keep playing a little more but it looks like future upgrades need gold which can only really be paid for or earnt through large ad watching (so not through honest grinding!). May not last.', ""Fun game but freezes and automatically closes after you pass level 8. Way to many glitches but has great potential. I'm really glad I didn't spend money on this game because I would have been extremely upset. Have to uninstall because it is unplayable after a certain level."", ""It's ok, the game is fun but the waiting to sell the stuff makes it boring. If you could play more then 10 min I would play all the time and probably send money like on other games I play."", 'Level 27, where y the new objectives? There are plenty of other buildings that could be developed! I am only missing a few items in each category and have been through every auction house many times and can not find them. Where do I go from here?', ""I really enjoy this game but there are a few things i must say: Unsolicited ads aren't fun. Remove them and Increase the rewards by watching videos. Players gladly watch them when the reward is good. And sometimes the game gets muted after watching one."", 'The game was ok at first. Then the ads became excessive. Started having to deal with 30 second ads after every little thing I did. Ok other than that.', 'Fun game. Hard to earn a lot of money. The units are a bit predetermined by the computer. This line of work is all about profit. Think of it as the game posing as the government taking a portion of the profits. Interesting and fun game in the end.', 'Good concept. Energy drains SUPER fast. Can only play for a while until it refills. Yet again, if you have money to spend on regular upgrades instead of good rare content go for it.']"

The game used to be a lot of fun and I'd spend hours playing it, but then life happened and it's been a few years since I played. I went back to play it today and there's too many unskippable ads. I can't make more than a few taps or even upgrade my prestige because it's literally an ad every 30 seconds. The worst thing about the ads is that it crashes my tablet every time! Uninstalling after 5 minutes"", ""I like this game very much. I am playing this game for more than 1 year. But there are too many ads. They are like every 30 seconds. That's why I am giving 3 stars. Please show us lesser ads. It's not letting me upgrade anything. And I am forced to watch the ads. Please fix it. Thank You."", ""I like this game but on the form where you fill it in and get 15 diamonds you have to put in your name,age,where you live and your Email some of the the people that play are kids including me and you can do the form as many times as you want so you might be able to get more than 15 I don't know I haven't received the 15 diamonds yet. and also when the people appear on your screen and say I its not just a present it's medicine you have to watch the video to improve the game put yes/no buttons."", ""The game is fun, but there are too many unskippable ads. This game also has the standard optional ads that you can watch for 'free' boosts or chests and those are balanced. The ones that pop up in the middle of gameplay do so about every two minutes, and you can't opt out."", ""Hello and I really love this game. I have installed it today and I made good progress. The reason I love it is because it can entertain you at any place and there's lots of things to do, so I recommend people to play it and I hope it will be fun for you guys! And thank you for creating this game, I wish you luck too! :D"", ""Its a really fun app! If you're looking for a good simulator game, I highly recommend this one.

It\'s INSANE!!!!', ""It's good and all but sometimes the unskippable ads pop up and you can't skip it which make it the rating go down to 3 stars originally I would've given this game 5 stars but it was mainly because of the unskippable ads if you can change it then I'll give this game 5 stars"", ""This was a great game.

Guys keep on popping up from the side of your screen, but you dont have a decision to watch the ad or not. If you press the screen, the ad comes on.

When i play i get this game i NEVER STOP! It's 10:00 at night right now. So keep up the good work!

Download it now!"", 'Was a very good and addictive game, but now the game is constantly being interrupted by having to click on the page to run ads for diamonds (no option to not watch).

At first I was annoyed that to get fame you had to get a new tower and lose your shops but it's so easy to rebuild it! Thankyou so much for creating such a fun game!"", ""I think this is a great game and all I can say about it is that there is so much things to do, but the only problem I have with it is that I accidently pressed the times ten button on the side too many times so I have to wait for a lot of money to generate, don't do that, but anyway great game that's why I gave it five stars,congratulations!👏I like the idea of being rich🤑"", ""i dont receive the rewards from ads because it crashes after the ad is finished.

All new ways to earn free gear in events!","['Disgusting! No support in the Kongregate forums and no answers in the Playstore with other languages. Many bugs not fixed since the release in 2017. Since the update after the weeks-long failure of the events in autumn 2019, it is a nasty P2W game. I invested a lot of money in September 2019 where the events had better requirements and conditions. Why do you treat customers so miserably? Give me my money back!', ""Game is ok but when I complete the requirements to get free gold I never get it. Not the first time it happens either. It says can't contact support for 24 hours and when you do, no help. Feels kind of like a scam (false advertising). UPDATE: Customer service just credited me the missing gold. Very quick. Thanks again."", ""Been playing for a long time(3 yrs) and loved it but now it's not so good...The ADS don't work half of the time which is needed to get ahead and there hasn't been a good update since October..fix the game please and you will make a lot of customers happy"", 'Developers do not take into consideration the blatant errors in the game pointed out on their feedback message boards by the players . Very frustrating. Playing of ads is critical to successful game play and the do not function at least 50% of the time.', ""Game was great till maxed out everything. Once I maxed everything out the ads stopped giving me more than one at a time. This game is okay but not so great that I want to have to open every 4 hours for bonus. If this isn't fixed soon I'm done. Weird since ads are what you make your money on it might be worth your while to make sure they work. Been over a month now."", ""Good overall except that stupid gift option, It keeps making me go to the shop even though I can't collect the gift as i collected less than 4 hours ago so I can't play until the gift is ready again"", ""Ads won't work at all. There's in game ads that will not play, but they still tried to make me watch an ad in between the event and the game which has no reward."", 'Boring game after a few hours of play, event not working properly either, running in slow motion. Yep app deleted', ""I'm not certain if I am the only one with this problem? The event tab runs very slowly compared to the main game."", ""Big fan of the game, BUT the last two events are almost unplayable. Game stutters, you can't scroll the screen and there's severe lagging on key presses. Please fix, and get 5 stars. Also personally hate the clothes features unnecessary and boring."", ""I can't use my ad bonuses. I can't seem to watch any ads."", 'Game events are laggy AF, while the main game runs fine. That would be ~3 stars from me, but the static bright white elements in the game are burning my screen, 1 star is too many.', ""The events seem to lag really bad. Not sure what's up with that. Main game everything is fine. Events.. idk"", 'the event is unplayable, stutters and lags.', 'Still great game. You should really bring back rugular monitary value amounts. Then you will be great again!', 'Fun but at first quite slow', 'The first time I had played it, I hated it. Now that I have decided to put some effort into it, I absolutely really like the game. But the one thing that I hate the most, is that the ads freezes up halfway through while watching them and there is now way to get them to start playing again therefore forcing you to restart the game all over again and when you successfully do, the bonus video icon disappears and you have to wait for it to pop back up again. Plz fix this, then my rating will change.', ""This game has too much lag and it's not the device I'm playing on."", ""Have played for years, liked it until about a week ago when they have now stopped side events with no response to anyone on the forums as to why. Not worth the spamming of ads that happens, you will get no where with no events. 100% don't waste your time or storage capacity there are better games out there."", 'The Ad bonus dont work ????', 'Events are unplayable.', 'This has been my favorite game for a year or more to play now. The side events were the best. Suddenly there are no more side events to play. Sucks because now I am looking for a new game and its hard to find one.', ""I would have ranked the game higher if they pay me the gold they owe me for completing tasks after downloading third party games. As it stands they owe me over a 1000 gold, although the game says it's paid you it has not . and there's no way of contacting them to let them know that they owe you. But other than that it's a good game."", ""The concept is good but the execution is poor. Most of this game you can just leave it and forget it. It's super easy to just buy higher Lobby pay outs and then just leave it over night. I'd prefer a politics Sim where you actually have to convince people and react to public sentiment, take a stand on issues, etc. This is just another mindless mobile game thst doesn't require much skill. 3 stars because surprisingly, the ads are minimal and non-intrusive which is unusual for an adsupported game."", 'i used to play this a lot. i hadn\'t touched in about a year or so. something has definitely changed and not for the better. you can spend more than 5 minutes in the game without the display pummeling you over the head about watching ad videos or accessing their ""partnerships"" to get gold. having it be an option is one thing but to have constant notifications about them or notification bubbles that don\'t clear about them is very annoying. i had to delete it and i don\'t think I\'m coming back.', ""It has alot of issues like when the little TV screen shows up in the bottom left hand side and asks you if you want to multiply everything for the next hour there's a advertisement and after the ad my screen just goes black. The performance of the game is also a little laggy making it impossible to play the game and the numbers are messed up like 1.1e9 it shows up as. The music is just as horrifying as listening to Oprah music from some ancient era. I would like these issues to be resolved so that everyone who downloads this game can play it like a normal game without any problems."", ""It ended up charging me every month. I had a lot of trouble and lost a lot of money. Don't download it! Harder to get this all straightened out than to fix idenity theft."", ""I love this game. good for wasting time. unfortunately I've been trying to load the game for hours now and keep getting a screen saying it's down for maintenance. on the day of the event starting too! very upset. I hope that I'm not effected due to I'm just now able to begin the event. also, a little notice next time would be great. will give five stars once this is fixed."", ""Takes forever to get past level 10/11. The levels take too long after that. Also, the cash made offline does not go to the next level, which is stupid. Extras are expensive in gold. Enjoy to level 10 or 11 and uninstall. Outfits are outrageously expensive and they do duplicate items wasting gold. Other idle games do it way better. I don't mind spending a few bucks on a game, but this one is outrageously expensive for a small payoff. Oh, the game sucks the juice out of your battery."", ""I got bored with this game. There really isnt any strategy here. You tap for money and then spread it where you can afford and generate enough cash to buy an elected office. The stages just keep repeating the same way over and over. I chose Conservative and every random costume piece that could aid me was a Liberal item so I could never use it. That happened at least 5 times and never received a Conservative item of help so there's an obvious bias slant. After 2 weeks I uninstalled it."", 'Fun game, but don\'t try to get gold by downloading other games and playing them, especially if it\'s a large quantity of gold. I did one recently for 617 bars of gold and I completed it, the page on the game says I completed it, but I never received my gold. Fun game, but don\'t waste your time chasing ""free gold."" Would give it five stars if they actually awarded you with the gold they promised after putting in so much time playing another game that I didn\'t even want to play.', ""Not for me. If you like racking up money and the fundraising part of political campaigning you'll love this, if not you will, like me, find this boring and repetitive. I'm not knocking the game, I just feel the marketing is misleading. I thought this was more of a political game than a money making one. Unfortunately, I find that it's not as advertised."", 'The game is okay, but for some reason it, like many others has a terrible upgrade system. Example: in the events, you can spend event currency to get upgrades. I was running the math on one earlier. Reports give 0.66% bonus lobby production. I can spend 1500 reports to buy a 400% bonus lobby production upgrade. Those reports I would spend total up to 990%. So, but the upgrade, lose 560% production. Most of the upgrades are like this in events. Honestly, is it supposed to be a slap in the face to people who are bad at math, an insult to your players you are making money off of, or just piss poor development?', 'Overall, the game is completely BORING. The tutorial will take the average person around 30 minutes, and then after that, you\'ll probably want to uninstall it. I played this game for around 2 hours, its easy to play, but the graphics are bad, the process is long, and most of the time, you run out of things to do. At one point, the only thing I could do is repeatedly click a painting of Hillary Clinton. The ""cash"" system is complete garbage, and once you have enough cash, you have nothing to do.', ""If this game wasn't online only it would be one of the best idle games ever!! Please please please make it playable offline. That would make it a lot more fun and more convenient. I love this game and I want to play more offline than I do online. I feel that way about pretty much all Idol games."", ""I'm missing the retiree achievement and I dont know why I've retired quite a few times"", 'i always find it amusing how games view their currency. for an event, to get double resources, it costs 2000 gold. now that is just for an event which is about 5 days. regardless you dont get that permanently. 2400 gold is 19.99. I just fail to understand how a game justifies spending that much money for such a small time frame. sure there are different value packs for every event asking for money with various gold and bonuses. it just isnt worth the money, all the events are just a reskin with d', ""pretty fun tycoon/clicker-type game. its very satisfying to complete elections and there arent many intrusive ads. the only annoying thing is that you must have an internet connection to play, and the offshore account feature can only be accessed by paying real cash for it which makes it a redundant feature. I'd reccomend if youre into mindless clicker games, its pretty good as they go."", ""was a fun game, but dont do in game purchases. descriptions are off and when I let them know that what i received vs what i thought it said, all that was replied was that they'll improve the descriptions. no other offers of help, or any incentive to keep playing. I'll never send them any more money, ever again. seen many, many complaints on their dicussion boards too."", ""It's Cookie Clicker with a political flavor. That's kind of it. Sure there are events and costumes, however it does get old after a while. And it wants you to either buy gold or watch ads to get ahead. It's a compete waste of time, battery life, and finger tapping.""]"

Other than that i love every aspect of the game. cool trippy designs mixed with luchador wrestling and candy theme. This game is the bomb diggity!"", ""I just adore this epic action game! You can't deny that this has got to be one of the best games of all time. The action, the cutscenes, the luchadors, just everything about it rocks. I play this game for hours every single day and it's not a pay-to-win sort of game. People think so, but not me! Anyways, Burrito Bison Launcha Libre is a fun, ridiculously funny game that people love worldwide."", ""Amazing game the best part is it's not chocked full of ads so when the opportunity for an ad pops up like hey watch this video received a pinata I am more than willing to watch the ad because the add 2 Gameplay ratio is like 2005 level it's very pleasant ... it's really sad that you can tell the worth of a game now by the amount of ads they shove into it"", ""Sometimes when I open the game the items and special gummy bears look like black boxes. I guess they aren't loading in properly. If possible could you try to fix this please? Besides that this game is amazing. Not alot of ads. This is by far my favorite game on the appstore. I would give it 5 stars but that one frequent bug is why I won't."", ""Lovin it, great game, tho, I don't like the other launcha's, it should be just burrito bison, or ya should be to choose what launchador u use. Edit: the bug with the black screens was fixed for a day, but then every texture was black again, I dunno y, I was really happy when it was fixed, but for it to go back again kinda pisses me off"", ""Each game play is short, making it enjoyable in short bursts. The ads are not intrusive and always optional. The amount of things to do is just outstanding, the game doesn't get boring soon, unlike many similar games. The only reason I haven't rated 5 stars is because of a bug, which happens when you watch an ad to get more pinatas, and causes objects to turn into black rectangles. If it's fixed, the game deserves full points. Better hints for special gummy bears would be a bonus."", 'Burrito Bison was a fun game. Emphasis on the word ""was"". The bugs have made the game unplayable. The black rectangles in place of the special gummies, the looped pinata bug, the inability to link the game with your google play account, etc. The final straw for me was the non-existent support.

Game displays black boxes in place of game pieces at times. Freezes periodically. Both bugs seem affiliated with pinatas. Logged in with facebook to save progress after making it beyond frying pan. Uninstalled, reinstalled hoping for less problems. Logged back in with facebook and BAM. All progress was lost and had to start all over. Fun game, but needs a few fixes.', ""Been playing for a while now and just got back these days. Wonderful game, but the recent visual bugs at the first boots of the app was killing me, and we all can't access Play Games™ to sync the account. The black squares loading in place of every sprite except the main characters and standard gummies really adds an unnecessary difficulty. But it's only a front-end glitch, so it should be easy to fix in the next patch, so you guys need to do it ASAP for better gameplay and ratings."", ""I love the game.

I've spent close to 20 dollars on in app purchases, and it's amazing that the very regularly occurring bug only started after I had spent money on the app. I have encountered the bug three times within the last 20 minutes, and every time it requires a full restart, which removes the rewards you would have recieved that run.

Already uninstalled it, when you have the same speed all the time damn why are you still playing?', 'I like it helps pass time and kinda get into it after awhile 😊', 'Don\'t spend any money on this app! All of the buy buttons are single click actions. So if you buy gems, there\'s a chance you\'ll accidentally click a button and use them all on something you didn\'t want which is useless. I emailed the developers about this and they said ""unfortunately we can\'t restore items already spent"". This is complete BS and a greedy cop out. I would give this app a 0 star rating if I could. Edit: Typical response. Developer doesn\'t even understand what I\'ve said. Useless.', ""A decent idle game, but using your collected diamonds is poorly coded, and can't overlap, meaning you lose up to 24 hours of game play rewards if you do."", ""Your game is having issues collecting ore while closed, in that most of the time it doesn't collect. Which of course makes it hard to advance"", ""Instead of not allowing the upgrade buttons to be pressed when you can't afford an upgrade, it takes you to the premium currency shop, and all the high cost items are on the side with the upgrades. Therefore, if you spam tap the upgrade buttons, you may accidentally try to make a $50 purchase or spend diamonds without knowing and without delay. Luckily, Android requires confirmation before purchasing. I find this sneaky and underhanded. Another review calls this predatory, and I agree."", ""Poorly done idle game. Good graphics and animation but the gameplay is just appalling. No definite end goal. Upgrades are poorly priced and spaced. You can basically go from 1 major upgrade to the next, getting all 50 miniupgrades in between instantly, before waiting another 5 days to earn enough for the next major upgrade. The offline earning is also bugged, 30% of the time the earning doesn't occur after closing the app. Idle game enthusiasts probably stay away."", 'The way the ""buy more in-game money for real money"" dialog pops up when you try to upgrade stuff but run out of coins is quite predatory, only androids confirmation screen saved me from accidentally spending money. Progressing in this game is boring, as upgrades only give you higher stats, but don\'t unlock new mechanics. The ""soundtrack"" is extremely repetitive, it loops after a few seconds. The graphics are okay, but even on low settings battery draining.', ""Update again. It hangs when you receive ore that is too big for storage.

Developers dont care about the bugs, emailed them too many times and they said everything is fine. Youll watch too many ads in a short period of time. Had to redownload one day and lost my progress, played for months and had to start over. Can buy coins with gems but not even close to being worth the waste. $50 cash gets you 10.2 G/billion coins or you can wait a week or 2 and be making 10g/ billiin per click.', 'not bad but I keep asking myself ""why is this here?"" after you upgrade to a new part leveling up old Parts as useless and you can\'t even use the look the miners effectively do nothing and level up using a lot of gold to get very trivial gains I can get more sitting there doing nothing then the fisherman can get in half the time and whenever my drill stops fully I can\'t help but ask again why is this here I run into too many things that make me question ""why?""', ""Played until floor 5000 and I've gotten the second to last upgrade on all excavator parts. The roadblock I hit is massive and will probably require me to play for months just to get 500 more floors. It feels like the ingame scaling needs some attention, math-wise, and the game lacks an incentive to continue playing (I.e a form of reset/ascension to actually make progress feasible.) overall this *could* be a good idle game, but it's current state makes it a *game over* for me."", 'Simple and funny', ""This is the kind of game you spend 2 hours playing when you only intended to spend 15 minutes playing.

Plat at your own risk... seriously."", ""ads time out on data. ads say network error on wifi. pointless to try ads. clicking highest or lowest level completely skips any bonuses on the levels. no indicator on screen If there are bonuses. no way to know unless you want to constantly scroll up and down manually constantly. 300 gems for auto opening chests is a joke even if it's for 24hrs. betting it won't tap the rocks. 300 gems not easy to come buy especially not every 24hrs. auto open has nothing to do with existing chests on screen btw"", 'This game is ridiculous and not in a good way. You dig for two minutes and hit a roadblock that can make your drill grind to a hault. You can remove it by watching upto four 30 second adds. Then you can watch your drill for two minutes before another roadblock. You randomly get a debuff that drops your drill speed to zero so no movement and you remove them with another ad. For every ten minutes of game I am watching over ten ads.', ""I love the game because you can never stop going levels also they your workers still work while your away!

Don’t forget to report any bugs you come across - we’re constantly working hard to make improvements!","[""Good game for the most part! I hate the fact that the game asks you to leave feedback during the oil selling screen, you have to wait a long time for a $60 sale comes just to be hit with a 'leave feedback' screen to pop up and lose the sale. I feel like it always happens and it's quite annoying. That's my only complaint, otherwise a very good clicker/swipe idle game."", 'Nice game. Well balanced as far as the more work you do the more in game money you get. Per dimonds and cases and coins. But i wish it didnt have the bug flying round the whole time. And i wish double pumps used one finger. Otherthan that the game will just shut off after 30 mins of play. And you can only play with your data turned off or on airplane mode. It gets to be too bugy with data on. Still shuts off after thirty min tho. I still like the game. I have reset for double extraction.', ""It was fun until I broke the game by exploiting the no ads which allows you to get all the watch video bonuses by just clicking on it and getting it. If you just buy the 190million underground pump it gives you the option to reset. This also gives a 2x multiplier that keeps stacking and now I'm at -quadrillions and cant buy anything cause the money is negative. So it's very exploitable at the moment."", ""Game was working fine and I really enjoyed it until today it just stopped running. I've tried reinstalling it, rebooting my phone and clearing cache data.

Don't waste your time with this garbage app."", 'Was a good game at the start, but niw when I try play it is stuck on the loading oage and goes no further.

It is only active for 3 minutes at a time before the player needs to watch another ad to continue. There are ads between transitions, ads when you sell resources, ads when you purchase something, ads, ads, ads. Go play any other idle game.', 'I loved this game and really enjoyed it. So much so that I spent my money on a bunch of diamonds within the game and yet there is a setting to reset your game to get double profit. I expected it to get rid of my in game cash and reset me but it also erased the nearly 300 diamonds I had purchased. When a game literally steals money from its playerbase it deserves a 1 star rating or less. Sad practices.', 'The game itself is a decent fun and mildly addictive game. I gave it 2 stars because this game is completely overrun with adds. To prove this there is a mechanic that can auto mine oil for 5 min, during that time the well pops out cases that can be opened by waiting time or watching 2-6 adds per case. You can only hold 3 cases. While watching adds for the cases the auto mining timer pauses. That have been times I have had one 5 min timer last over an hour trying to keep up with the cases.', ""At its start this game was not bad as a way to waste a bit of time. As time has gone by and the devs have added content more and more ads have been included and now it spoils the game. You are now forced to watch ads and when claiming your earned cash you are presented with only one option to watch an ad if you didn't know you have to wait for another option to appear"", ""It is a fun game, but every 2 minutes I'm forced to watch ads if I want to progress."", 'Not a bad game but are too many ads like all games are.', 'You like ads? Here they are every where. Ads for bonuses yup, ads for doing something for you yup, but only works while you are in game, ads just because you wanted to go sell or anything at all? You got it. You bought 30 diamond cases for 120 diamonds? Now their gone, where did they go? No idea. Anything good takes 2 days to unlock, example the lab unlocks after like 12h and then pumps or barrels take 24h. You can reset the game for 2x bonus(only for oil) but also you loose everything of value.', ""too many ads. ads for boosts is fine, but when I want to move from one location to another, don't make me watch an ad. To double profits, watch an ad .... to take the normal profit ... I shouldn't have to watch an ad ...... too many ads disrupt game flow/play. I won't be playing this one any more."", ""Good game. Love playing it. BUT. With playing a lot of idle games... diamonds should not be reset when doing the x2 reset. Oil and cash yes. But not the diamonds, especially since it's a currency that can be bought with real money. That's how every other idle game I play works. Unfortunate that this one gets rid of them."", 'The ad does not work got to get this s*** fixed all app need to be fixed.']"

I've watched plenty of ads but I don't think it should be you need 4 removals per debris."", 'Wasted potential, ads are intrusive, and there is not much balance, I hoped I would have to strategize and make the right building combinations but it\'s simply building whatever the best building is and making sure you have enough banks to sell the energy.

You can really tell how much the developer likes money though. It's a hard cash grab. Progress in this game is majorly stunted by how much money the dev is trying to bleed out of you at every single corner/opportunity.

Worst ad experience to date, so much so that this is my first review of an app.', ""Pretty horrendous. This game will absolutely monster its way through your battery. There is no real way to succeed without watching ads. Certsin in-app purchases do not carry over when you prestige. Not worth your time. Update: the game gets worse and worse. It's even more laggy now than it was when I posted my original review. It requires regular force quits, ads don't pay out properly, and the issue of purchases being a complete scam persists. The UI is also pathetic."", ""Great, fun game if, like me, you enjoy a bit of strategy mixed with simple wealth accumulation. My only drawback is when reaching a certain point, there is a big jump, and a long wait (a couple of days), before you can accumulate enough to buy the next technology (Stellarator). Otherwise, it's enjoyable and one I keep coming back to play. Watching ads to get bonuses will help a lot but you can skip them but it will take longer. Also when you get to the end, you can start again with a 4x bonus."", ""Great game. Would love if you could place over buildings to upgrade. For example, if you have the 1st tier bank placed, you would go to the build section, click on the 2nd tier bank, then click on your 1st tier bank that's already place and the 2nd tier bank would place over it to upgrade it. Then when you click the check mark to purchase it the bank would just turn into a 2nd tier bank. Kinda confusing but I hope it can be brought to the game."", 'Good game, I would like to suggest some additions. Having research facilities use power would be a welcome addition, making the game more challenging.

I had 1 nuclear reactor and the rest of the map was filled with offices and research facilities. There's no easy way to find out the correct generator/heat output ratio, no info on total generation/selling. The game has very low fps, making scrolling look like lag. Also, solar panels generate heat instead of electricity in this game. Many ads and money milking things. Just a bad experience overall"", 'When I first played the game it was easily 5 stars. Now once you get to the stellarator it is just incessantly time consuming to unlock. Research price should be lowered from 5 AA to atleast 1 AA. Remain a challenge but not make you wanna quit playing.', 'I have fun managing and figuring out my reactors, offices and research, but it would be nice if you could have a button to destroy X amount of Z building (where X represents the number to destroy, and Z representing the name of a building)', ""So far, it's been fun, only thing I have to complain about is that there's no background music, so all you get is the various clicking sounds; even adding sounds to the machines would be suffice."", ""Game over all is really fun and I really do enjoy it. Complaint I have is some of the things cost way too much and it's encouraging you to end up paying for a thing like a research points to get something that's costing 200 billion. Game over always fun would rate Five Stars if it was a little cheaper. Keep up the good work"", 'This game is freaking amazing. Prestiges are very useful and serve a purpose after you research everything. The early game is somewhat confusing (kinda unavoidable when you first play), the mid game makes you feel smart and late game goes very quickly in comparison to the other stages. There are two problems though. 1. The game soft locks quite a bit when building and destroying multiple tiles 2. The 15 minute cool down for the squid feels too long because late game kinda revolves around him.', ""UI disappears every minute or two when I try to place or delete buildings, even after two years since I've had this game. Seems to get worse the more prestiges I obtain, makes me think it's an intentional game design."", ""Fun passive game, doesn't take long to finish, I reached the stage where I can up my prestige in 15min, removing trees and mountains is not worth waste if time but they can make you think more on how to be more efficient, few bugs that I encounter are that sometimes the game starts freezing and I have to restart it, when I upgrade my dark matter thingies the upgrades never stay they just disappear and so does my energy, it's extremely annoying. Looking for this fix really plz."", 'pretty fun game, lotsa adds, you may relly on adds, but they dont just ranomly pop up on you, its your choise if you get an add (most of the time). want you to rate their game A LOT. very pushy on that thats why i gave 4 stars.', ""It's fun and there is no worry about ads always popping up.

The start is easy to get used to (wind turbines) but the heat/power is a little time consuming to get used to. The one problem I have is that there is a island the cost irl money but is the biggest. My rating is a 4-5"", ""Very fun little game. I like the diversity in build options and the theme kinda carries you away into this neat little world where you play an energy industry tycoon. The graphics are typical of any new mobile game, thanks to the wonderful advancements in mobile gpu archeticture. Fun game, I'll be playing it for awhile."", ""Kind of fun, slows down significantly at unlocking stellarator. Ad banners block you from confirming destroying buildings, effectively forcing you to restart the app. Without this bug I'd give it 4 stars."", ""One of the best games to play casually. It might get kinda slow towards higher scores but the excitement doesn't leave. Ads are VERY (emphasis on that) less and gameplay is clean and fun."", 'It is a really time consuming game that continues to collect resorces while you are away! I like to leave it for a few days and then log on when it has loads of money waiting for me!', ""I think it's a great concept maybe a little bit of a touch up to the graphics and add some like managers to make it harder cause I feel like it's really easy. I would love for it to be a smidge harder. I wish it didnt take so long to get rid of trees though."", ""It's a nice game I have a fun time playing it but please add this idea that the player could move the building/industries in the game it would be very nice.

Everything is great except I wish the starting island was a little bit bigger, otherwise, one of the best mobile games!"", ""A stellar game A perfect balance of adverts to gameplay, I get a skippable as every hour or so and it's wonderful.

Reloaded the game several times, tried click around the black screen and it seemed like I was interacting with the stuff in the game. The black dcreen didnt go away, so I came here, read the reviews, and according to them, this game has ton of issues, I think I'm done here."", 'I absolutely love this game! I would give 5 stars but there is an issue with the sounds or something. Only when the app is open and I\'m playing does my phone make a weird ""buzzzrt"" electrical noise. Its happening more and more frequently. It\'s kind of concerning. The game its self is very addictive but that sound issue has me a little scared to continue playing in fear of my phone messing up.', ""The game itself is kinda fun, but it definitely pushes you towards micro transactions. I personally am a sucker for these, but sometimes the game doesn't even let you buy the micro transaction. Saying that it is unavailable. If you are looking for a mindless time consumer that doesn't allow you to catch up to anyone who's been playing it a while. Then this is the game for you. If you are looking for a game with any amount of content feel free."", ""This game is a subpar cash grab. I've been playing for 8 months hoping it gets better. The game is updated regularly, but the updates are mostly cosmetic. The new blueprints are lame. The hero/quest system is trash. Once you make it so far in the game, it becomes nearly impossible to progress unless you spend $1000 a week on gems."", 'Love how my review suddenly disappeared. Reconnection issues need to be fixed. Constantly reconnecting. Simply switching to a text message is a guaranteed ""disconnect"" which runs the risk of setting you back several minutes. Got ticked enough to say something as the game had to ""reconnect"" and set me back 30 minutes of upgrading, and this was without me closing my phone, or switching apps. It\'s also on a charger and connected to 5GHz wifi. Completely unreliable connection issues with this game.', ""I am really enjoying this game. The only ads are for in-app purchases and they aren't in your face about it. 2 little things that would make the game play more user friendly: 1)Being able to see and check your goals in the City AND Quest pages. Not just your shop. 2)Being able tojust check what materials an item requires when your item building queue is full."", 'Free to load and play for a little.... top grossing yeah because much of the locked stuff costs a bunch. Monthly subscription .... $30+ dollars to unlock a few extra features then another 40+ dollars to unlock a few more features with no other options to unlock. Pity really ... if I would have known that would have played for maybe 5 minutes rather than a few weeks... I wasted my time on a game that could have had me maybe spend a few bucks here and there but the costs were just to high', 'This is a genre of game that it is so very easy to get wrong. Thankfully, the developers here know what they are about; they have created a beautiful game, both graphically and musically, with engaging gameplay. While there are a number of encouragements to buy in-app packs, I still never felt pressured to spend money, and in fact, intend to but something for myself when I get paid as a thank you for the hours of fun I have already gotten out of Shop Titans. Great work, devs; this game is a gem.', ""Perfect game for me but the only problem here is you're server which makes player go back to loading screen after a short disconnection. I recommend a new way setting like a disconnect/reconnect which let us resume the things that we are doing rather than going back and forth :) thank you for undertanding. Keep up the good work and yeah. Ilove you're game, godbless!"", 'I just started playing this and I am strangely addicted! I am really enjoying this game overall! I do have a few suggestions though. 1. Finding the right guild is very difficult! Should be better ways to search your level, etc. 2. Once you get into specialized gear, it is very slow to quest. Wish there were additional wayd to get item requirements. 3. The market place is also difficult to navigate and find what you need at a reasonable price.', 'Honestly this game is a good game. But the connection problem are ridiculous. Sometimes we already craft thing, or doing an adventure but suddenly pop up a notification telling us that we lost an internet connection. And then we login again, guess what? We have to repeat what we have done before.', 'I was surprised at how enjoyable this game is. Before I knew it hours had passed by. It gives me that same feeling I got when playing Roller Coaster Tycoon back in the day. The PTW options are there (and I took advantage of a couple of them) but the game isn\'t impossible without them. It definitely goes 0-60 in terms of ""difficulty,"" making your first village upgrade 1k then leaping them up to 14k for the next; but again, it\'s not impossibly difficult for a little time waster. Fun!', ""When the games not constantly crashing it's a great game. Unfortunately since the update for Christmas it's hard to que things up due to this. That is the only reason it didn't receive 4 stars from me. Update: the crashing issues have been fix at least for me and the games been getting better esp with the golem events that are happening"", ""Wonderful game! I like how peaceful and calming this game is. In addition, I also like how this is actually a shop-like game with a few additions that I quite enjoy. I, however, don't really like how some actions/characters/items are locked behind a paywall. But, when compared to other games, I guess this isn't too bad and I hope it doesn't get worse. I hope to see an update for things like new clothing or perhaps even a new addition like an arena or world boss/multiplayer."", 'Love yhe game really do. Just a couple of issues. It keeps crashing every few minutes. I dont onow why but yeah. Also all of a sudden you wont accept my bank account. Its cool you dont want my money thats fine. But my bank account has more than enough money for the package i want and youve accepted this account before. Im not saying it cant be my banks fault only saying these are the issues ive run inti the only one of which that truly bothers me is the constant crashes. Still love it tho', ""After like 3 years of Shop Heroes, this game is just a prettier, more well done version of that. You make and manage your own party, you get to watch quest battles play out, and it's all rendered in 3d. That being said, keep in mind these games are major time sinks if you don't spend money."", 'I very much enjoy the game. I do find the game heats up my phone and then starts to lag if played too long. I wish that crafting had a text filter also and that the inventory and market were structured more like the craft shop. (Also if I could filter for only items I had to sell in the market would be nice.)', ""I absolutely love this game. Probably my favorite game on here, and I've tried a lot of games out. Unfortunately, it takes up a TON of space, so I will be uninstalling. Which is too bad. If you guys could optimize it a bit better and not take up almost all my space, I'll rate it a 5 and reinstall."", 'This game is about crafting, selling, design build and fight. This game contains creative. The weapons can use for fight and you may also craft shield, bow, wizard wand and healing items.Those items even have rarity. This game is very good for people that is bored for playing pvp or 50vs50 games and it is good for kids too! Last I hope you will play this game called Shop Titans.', ""Spent about 2hours playing. It disconnected twice for no reason and I lost half hour of progress each time. Impossible to play as it is, I'm sure I didn't have any connection issues since I'm also playing in my laptop and nothing happened. I'm unninstalling until you do something about it"", ""This is one of my favorite games ever! To play it is pretty simple. Easy controls and all. But then it's complicated at the same time! Which is a great amount of balance. I love the guild I run and the people in it I get to chat with every day. I love all the new updates and that the people running it do updates and add new things all the time so it doesn't get boring!!! I highly recommend! If you ever see me in world chat, send a shout out! I'd be happy to respond!"", 'A play to win game, like most are nowadays, if your not paying 10 dollars a month for the subscription on top of microtransactions, you are playing with a severe handicap. Yes, I admit I was cause I did like the game. After 3 months, I had a problem, and I sent a message to the help desk. 3 days later, with no response I cancelled my subscription. If Kabam is not willing to shell out some money for a decent customer service then that is a sure sign, absolute disregard for players.', ""Fun and charming game with a simple playstyle that contains enough nuance to keep you busy and engaged. My only issue and the reason I can't rate the game higher is simply because it keeps freezing on me, forcing me to lose progress and redo things. If that gets fixed then the game would be all the better."", ""I really enjoy playing this game. It's exactly what it is a shop game to build and sell items. Update your shop and just enjoy the game. What it needs: A better build queue manager. To auto accept built item to your inventory and to add an item list for the build queue These update would make the game exceptional! ;D"", 'The Micro transaction are stupidly priced, $10ish dollar a month? Are you mental? And don\'t even get me started on the $40 ""guns and crossbow"" worker unlock. The game constantly pushes you to buy extremely expensive content. Which honestly isn\'t worth it, because the content has all the same long timers as everything else. When you get late into the game the timers are so painfully long that it forces you to buy MORE gems, just to meet daily missions. What a massive scam. Buy better games.', ""Great game, good balance, and NO ADS. Some of the options are a little expensive, but since there are no ads even in the free version I'm willing to look past that. Since this most recent update with the addition of guild bounties, there's always something to do and you feel like your progressing and contributing."", 'Fun for the first few hours. After that it starts charging ridiculous prices to keep playing. This is a game about crafting weapons but entire weapon types are locked. To unlock you need to buy characters at 30-50 bucks per weapon type. And that excludes subscriptions you need to buy to get your normal rewards from questing. 3 dollars would be fine. But 30?! Thats a full priced AA game.', ""Really fun. No ads! What? That's right just in game offers at least so far. Very pleased with this game as it's actually engaging and challenging. I'm left felling that progress is constant in the beginning as I'm not far along. Will update the more I play."", ""It's a good app, love the style and gameplay. But it drains my battery life and overheats. I usually can binge play games for 4-5 hours on my phone, but this game lasts about 1-1.5 hours. Can you please find a way so it doesn't overheat my phone and cause the battery to go down faster?"", 'Awesome game very imersive good business learning game. Love the features and adventure part as well. Lots of grinding but never boring. Does take time to build best crafts however worth it. You do not have to pay to win and is possible f2p and makr high rankings. Also the best part is there is a support team that is super helpful and will do what they can to help you. But at same time if its in policy it cant be helped.', 'Typical tycoon gameplay with a twist of having a small harem of dnd style characters that you suit up with the gear you craft. Things start costing rare resources and you send them out to get them to make more. Its strange, though, because the more you play this game, the less you end up playing because the time it takes to make equipment gets longer as you go on. Not reccomended if you want a time waster, as this is something you gotta commit to.', 'Absolutely fun game and you dont have to put it down like other mobile games. I cam always find stuff to craft. Stuff to sell. Check on heroes and do investments or talk to the guild or global game. Its absolutely fantastic. There is always room for improvement though and I hope to see them try to come up with ways to unlock some of their recipe trees in game instead of behind a pay wall', ""Addicting AF, it's the only game I've ever been able to play for months. 4 starts simply because the in game purchases are a little high. Besides that this game is amazing for any shop game lover. Customize your shop, send heros on quests, and join amazing and helpful guilds! I recommend this game to anybody looking for a great time killer and fun teamwork experience."", ""It feels like one of those old Facebook game, if I recall it correctly it was restaurant city or something, this game is super fun and very addicting, it doesn't feel like a pay to win game but it does take a lot of your time tho. Really enjoyable and fun. 10/10"", 'First the game is awesome. But then I noticed when I start quests and go offline for a little while, the quest is gone like I never excepted a one. Same is with heroes. Had to craft hammers, but had to go off because rl stuff. Comming back - hero is gone and all the hammers. Not acceptable', 'After the valentine\'s update, every 9 out of 10 times I click the floating broom icon, I see a popup modal saying ""this profile cannot be viewed because its owner\'s shop titans app is not up to date."" I know this is not true, because the profile I just clicked was my husband\'s, and I know his version is up to date. Could you please fix this bug?? Other than this, I\'m really really enjoying this game♡', ""Amazing time killer, Devs are awesome and helpful, and the global chat is really helpful. It's nice to find a game that isn't full of hostility. I would ask that you make it a bit more in depth with character customization. Maybe make it where you can spend gems to unlock the Orc, Dwarf, Goblin and Elf body for your Character?"", 'Great game, built the wayback tycoon should be, but definatly need some cheaper options. Needing to pay a larger sum to get more than 2 hero/champions (which you NEED to craft certain gear.) If you made it a little easier/cheaper to collect hero/champions, would be a great game.', ""Its a pretty fun little time killer. You can send heros to dungeons to get materials and use those to make better gear to sell. Some customers offer you gear for sale for you to resell. Has sort of a story mode too. Crashed 2 or 3 times my first hour but, so far it's gotten smoother."", ""Best Shop Game in the Playstore!!! Love it!! The optimization is amazing, the graphics are impeccable, this game is super fluid and it looks like the Dev's are taking their time. Everything is customizable to your liking. And how can anyone say that the developers are greedy? I personally enjoy the fact that PREMIUM players are rewarded for investing in the developers. I have gladly invested in this game, well over $300 to be exact. Everything can be obtained without paying, GLOBAL SHOP!!!!""]"

Have an awesome idea? Write us an email: community@idlefactorytycoon.com","[""Was a good game at the start. But once I fully unlocked the 2nd set of factories, the ad buttons quit working. I can't boost or collect resources fast with that. So it takes a long time to unlock a new line or even unlock another factory. All in all, good game. But dont play to long so you dont run into these issues. Restarting my phone used to fix it but it doesn't anymore. So loved the game but it's time to say good bye."", 'I really liked this at first was getting ready to spend real cash. Then workers started to disappear after opening chests. The wrong number of workers not appearing in chests example 1 worker in chest that supposed to have 4 and then that 1 worker not appearing in game. Good save got to keep my cash. Uninstalled moved on. Oh and kolibri dont post contact customer support tried several times no joy.', ""Giving back a star. The ad thing worked! Thank you. I'm still bummed about the hundreds of hours lost when I had to delete the app. I was really hoping that a reconnect to Facebook or Google play would give me the option to pick up where I left off. Bummed that I used to play this game like crazy and it won't link my account. And there are absolutely no ads right now. I can't speed up a single thing in the game. Hopefully it's just a temporary glitch?"", ""Good game, just what you'd expect from this company and an idle miner game. Game runs smooth and is stable. Only gripe I have is the ads and the cost to get rid of them. That's the reason I only gave 4 stars other wise it be a very ?"", ""It's a pretty cool game you can play without paying for anything which I've done for several years or when you start making the extra cash you can get some of the little add-ons and it makes it a little bit easier. But all in all a pretty cool game. Although ads on occasion do not work correctly."", 'I loved this game, but the recent update was a disappointment as I now have to manually activate all the super workers and even the lowest rank guys to get their bonuses. Like I busted my butt to upgrade and streamline production but now all that was a waste. They just made an already detailed game that WAS fun, now just a confusing and IRRITATING hassle to assign EVERY worker on EVERY level and more. I wish I could un-update. This new ability to ""customize"" has ruined all IDLE fun of the game.', ""The game seems like one big cash grab, with very little actual gameplay. The first four 'features' that were unlocked were just more ways to spend money or watch ads to speed the gameplay loop up, with several forced ads for progression. A really cheap and shallow experience, would not recommend for anyone."", 'Great game, ads stopped working on last update. Worked for exactly 1 ad before quitting again. If I keep resetting I can get one ad each time.', ""All the boosts you need don't work because the ads can't load or play, I've done all the fixes and nothing works."", 'you guys are obviously not listening to us. as this last update shows.was great now its just tap heroes. In response...no thank i dont need to ignored in email too. Just wish this game was still challenging.', ""I love it similer to idle miner tycoon but instead of mining you produce goods to sell to people all over the world i'd love to see more games if you guys have enough money to afford it"", ""I'd rate the 4 stars. I played this before in the past, so I'm rate this before it asks me to. Reason for 4 stars. Because I see that the developers took their time on this game. And they know how to make it addictive. And their ads for the game isn't misleading. So kudos. Why not 5 star? Because it always asks for me to rate their app."", 'I love the super cash. And the game and the money and the events and I love the game and it is the best game in the would I love it and I can get 1mill and 12 bill I love the water and I love it in rain can you make a updated and can you plz I will double and triple the money and it will go to homeless people in the world.', 'Great game for passing the time! I rate this a 5 it is worth the download compared to others of its type! 😊😊', 'You cant unlock new progress without watching ads. So thats a no for me.', ""These are the kind of games i like.The ones where you don't have to play every day. But you still keep on earning."", ""I love it. I feel like I have played this game like a hundred times. I would recommend this to people who love games such as cash ink idle miner ect. I just don't know what to say next. All I can say is that...I love this game. It's now like my life! This is why I gave it a 5.5!"", 'I love this game. The animations are amazing and the game itself is very amusing', ""Love this brand of idle games, the others can't compare!"", ""Fun time stealer but since the update videos won't play so can't boost your cash"", ""It's cool for wasting time as most games do. That's not an insult, that's just what games do."", 'Love it, great for killing time even when its for only a few mins', 'I used to love this game now all the boost button ads no longer work. I think its time to let this game go. Sorry but thats a big deal breaker. Its hard enough trying to manage the long research and investments for a small game. Happens too often', ""It's great but could at least put something like a battle if you lose the battle you lose money if you win the battle you win some of there money and extra money too😀🤔🤔🤔"", 'I like this game.. But it much lagging and eat much ram.', 'This game is just like idle miner. If you like idle miner you would like this one too.', 'The game was fun when you could dictate which workstations make which item. Now all the workstations make pretty much the same thing. The new update has dumbed down the gameplay. Terrible update . Change it back to what it was please and thanks', 'This he is very addictive and is very hard to leave once u start playing. You also get alot of money real fast which keeps u into the game without boredom. Love it. Would rather it 5 stars. Also one of the best idle tycoons evee', ""Such a huge thing to balance out how the resources work in this. I like the idea of there being many things to unlock, but I still haven't managed to get anywhere with that. It isn't really fun to me, but it's a well made app."", 'not bad would love to see more content in the futire! yes I would like to see progress stats and possably more cosmetics to fancy things up if need be just keep up the awsome work and ty for responding!', ""Can't download game won't even connect with service I'm play other online games not having any problems even download some this one is screwed .........NOW that I got it downloaded and played it some it's about like idle miner good game if you like long drawn out slow going games that you don't get too far after playing it for months and everyday and still only be on level 13 please I'm over playing it for 100 hrs and not getting anywhere"", ""Words can't describe how much fun this has if you like games where you can upgrade and prestige and keep going and making more progress this is the game for you even if you don't like that this probably will make you love those kinds of games"", 'I would have rated this 5 stars. I could take watching an ad to open up the next level. However, yall have increased it to where you have to watch an ad just to open up the next station. Disapointing. Uninstalling.', ""I love this game this game has nothing wrong about it I hated the one-star reviewers they they were all wrong about their dogs have they said I did not like it at all that you were around a one-star review or I don't like your stuff if you don't like this game and you are a noob I am a God because I love this game so much sometimes my dog likes to watch me play Play Store glitches I hate it terrible I can't get anything right when I Google I hate when the Play Store glitches it is glitching righ"", 'I played quite alot before they majorly changed the game a while ago. Then I came back and played more, unlocking almost everything and I had all the super workers. I took a break again and now I have nothing...months of working at a game just gone...awesome', ""Not sure what the problem is, but the link to double the money by watching a video isn't working and hasn't been working for a couple days. What gives"", ""Seems to be one of the better idle games, although haven't played it too much so not sure if micro transactions will become a necessity...if they do I will quit the game."", 'The game does not open at all I redownloaded it twice and still have the same results . Another update Again i reinstalled it , yet another 1% crash . Was really a waste of time and data', 'I have only just started playing. Have idle miner and realy love it, so thought I would give this one a try. So far seems realy great. Thank you to developers for top games with thought input from players.', 'Good game but the music is a bit repetitive and gets a bit annoying after a while so can you maybe mix the music up a bit, thank you']"

Minor bug fixes, and performance improvements","[""Graphics and gameplay is awesome. However, as your level get higher, the price of improvement increases ridiculously. Also, after playing for a few hours, it asked the player to upgrade to higher level gym (Urban gym), and guess what: all upgrade and improvement achieved through the last few hours just has gone! The game started from the beginning with a new type of gym, that's all. And I guess it would continue doing that whenever you upgrade your gym. Feel like a waste of time."", ""It's okay, very much a game where you spend 30 sec actively upgrading, then leave it for 2 hours to earn money. Very ad-heavy and the paid upgrades are super expensive. I don't mind paying $3-4 to remove ads, but not $10+. Also, wish it was possible to upgrade more than one level at a time - super annoying to have to tap 100 times, especially after a recent renovation. Maybe a 10x button? Or a 'Max' which allows the maximum upgrades with the money on hand?"", ""I picked to rate this game 5 stars because in my opinion it is super addictive with all the different upgrades and upgrading to new gyms. It also helps with the man in yellow with bonus money or diamonds. If you want more money you can buy them with the diamonds when you finish your quests and gain them. Best game I've ever played! Love it so much!"", ""It is a great idle game. I've put a lot of time and effort into it where I've reached the end I believe. So I'm patiently waiting for an update so I can continue building a new gym as I've maxed everything so far. I've made app purchases so I've made some good efforts in this game. Will be waiting for an update so I can continue the game."", ""Great game! It's absolutely fun and addictive! Two thing is that additional thingy are quite high in price. One additional feature could cost around the price of a whole top-tier-playstore-game. Second is that their server give wrong reward a few times. Anyway who need those feature if it already addictive without those thing."", ""This game is more of a watch and ad game than idle game. In what Idle game the maximum tine you can be Idle from is 2 hours max! And with 10 dollars its 10?!?! The renovation is nice untill you see the devs gave up on more designs later on, I finished the game and got to the last renovation and now im stuck in a point where the is no resets so you are stuck for a week to get 20 upgrades to a spa that doesn't really give back. Don't play this"", ""It's an extremely fun game I enjoy it completely.. The only problem is that you should play it online only.. It prevents me upgrading anything when it doesn't want to connect to the server. Please make its so we can also play it offline please.."", 'I is a very good game. Unlike most tycoon games this one keeps you hooked. There is one minor downfall that is some things require many many coins. However you earn some money if you go away for a little while. So in my opinion it is a great game.', ""A very good game love to play it on the bus and its very fun and not hard but not to easy. But it's a very very good game idk why people don't like this game u should download it's free and fun. Have a good day to all the people that looked at this."", 'I like the game and all. Nice controls and experience. But i have a suggestion: While upgrading the area, can you please add a x50 or x100 upgrade so it can upgrade with one tap. It is very tiring that you have to keep clicking it .', 'Great game!! Cant stop playing! So addicting!! I would like you to lower the price of remove ads and get ad rewards. $10.99 is RIDICULOUSLY EXPENSIVE. If it was like $4 or $3.99 I would definietely purchase but please lower the price.', ""Fun game. I like that the ads are optional. You do have to watch them if you want to progress faster in the game but it's at your discretion instead of forced. I also play their super market and theme park idle."", ""Really addictive and great time waster as a gym man myself seeing equipment in odd places annoys me being a gym owner via this app feels good to b able to create my own space and it doesn't take long to become ritch it took me a day so download ."", ""It's a good way to kill time. The only thing that would make it five stars is if the game waited between giving ad offers. Nobody wants to watch 4 ads in a minute."", ""Very good game it is like you own your own business but it's not the same as the other games in many ways but overall it's a very good game for the players who have not played these kind of games before ^______^(^____^)"", 'I love this game everythig is affortible and you can SO much fun with it. It even has a little guy to help you. The ideas that are in this game is amazing.

Each time you upgrade you get new stuff', 'It was great!!!!!!!! Make more games like idle bank or idle phones. I rated it five stars exept it was bugging in videos . That was the only problemo.', ""It's easy at first but then in the later game you have to wait days just to collect enough money to get to a new gym I like to see all the different types of machines"", '2/11/2020- maybe another event? At least it was something to keep game of interest. Needs an update. Im kinda stuck and i have all the paid upgrades. Cant do but maybe 4 upgrade levels per day...and need over 100 levels to upgrade.', ""Ok fun game. Like most games it's a cash grab or sit through endless ad videos. I'll bore of this game soon enough because of it."", ""Meh. So painfully slow towards the end and I've lost all motivation to play and definitely not spending the $8 or 10 for x2 income. 😂😂"", 'I like this game The graphics are good. I like the simulation And Learns you discipline Very fun to play. And i like your games there the best', ""It was a fun game berry adicting but I feel that it wasn't a game that I would go to play everyday . Although, I would recommend this game to someone with some free time to play..."", ""It's amazing! It has awesome updates. The only thing negative is you have to be online all the time and have to watch videos for your trainers to work. Other than that it's fine. Best game ever! And if you want a game where you can relax and enjoy than this is the game for you!"", ""So, the game itself, the graphics and the system and everything are very well made and engaging. However, after playing for a couple weeks, there's only one way to actually make the progress you need to keep interest - watching ad after ad after ad. So two stars, sorry but it's clearly been rigged in the idle growth aspect to force more ads."", ""I agree with Liz Tran-Wong. Great start, but you can only prestige/restart 5 times before reaching the maximum gym currently available. Winter season is a neat idea, but it took 3 days of the 31 possible to complete everything. I considered spending money on this, but am glad I didn't since as of now, it feels like a beta version. Devs, please keep working on/upgrading the game and I'll be happy to boost my review to 4 or 5 stars."", 'This game is really amazing because you can earn money and upgrade a lot of things even you can if you upgrade something you will see a cow and grocery bags', ""It's a fun concept, but the progress is too slow for my taste. Once you hit the trillions it takes a while to make progress. It doesn't help that you only get money for 2 hours of time away before it cuts you off, and you have to spend $10.99! to increase it to 10 hours. Unless you spend more on the app than is actually reasonable for the purchase it's slow going. The ads also stopped rewarding me for watching randomly, even after restarting the app. So that didn't help..."", ""This game is great. Doesn't force ads down your throat or anything. 😌😌"", 'I really like this app. You can tell that alot of creativity went into the development of it, there is one thing I wish that made the game more desirable though. I can tell the science behind making profits as the make it strictly from in-game purchases and ad promotions but, I wish they didnt spam the option as I get annoyed by it sometimes. Other than the one complaint, great game.', ""Great at first. If you are one that buys the no add and manager, you complete the game in less than a day (at least to where it is possible to renovate). Impossible to make any progress. Even after buying content, rewards little $ over ten hours. Winter event disappeared giving nothing for progress but it was the same way. Restarting it made no difference despite the supposed extra from the snowflakes. Avoid this brand of games if you are one that tends to spend real $$ on these. It's a waste."", ""Fix your offline system like make it that I have to have a manager and wait for 2 hours just let me play the game when I want because free to player don't want to be forced to grind it out"", ""Love this game so much. Just telling you guys that you need internet connection for it. Brilliant game. You get your own gym and get you upgrade it. It a interesting game which make time fly so fast. It feels like 5 minutes into the game then you realise that you have been playing for one whole hour. The battery goes from 100 to 1 and then dies and your like I didn't even play for that long.Theres something wrong with this"", 'I have all the codigames and totally enjoy them all. The tiny little people are so cool. But the chase to have the best gym keeps this game addictive!!', 'This game is sort of fun at first but quickly becomes ""Idle Ad Tycoon"". Virtually everything you do kicks off a 30 second ad and it\'s basically a requirement to accomplish anything with much speed. You can disable them for $11 but I cant justify spending that kind of money just to experience the game in its default form. Purchases should enhance your experience not be a requirement.', ""Awesome game doesn't take much time and you can get good at it I say you buy it!"", 'I just love this game! you get to upgrade exersising equipment upgrade your gym!😄 And alot more! Its so much fun!😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄']"

Don't Install this."", ""Awesome have seen a single ad yet and great time play when nothing else to do and doesn't need wifi"", 'A great game to do when you are watching something or doing something beacuse its a very easy game to play, it gets progreeivly harder. Ive been playing for a hulour and im already loving it!', ""This game is amazing and was perfect but now when when upgrading I tap the updrade button and it darkens like I have clicked it but doesn't upgrade. I have to click an unnecessary amount of times for the upgrades. This needs to be fixed because I love the game but this one fault is making it almost unplayable for me. I will put it to five stars if this is fixed."", ""Great game, one of the best in its genre. Too bad it's been over a year since last update :( will redownload if there updates"", 'love the game as its simple but fun to play i recommend that everyone should play this like im new but i feel like im a player who played this for years yoy just have to tap for money then buy auto for the building to boom your way up', 'Its good but make it where u get more money like a infinity 5x money or just for a couple days like a EVENT YES A EVENT PLZ MORE EVENTS!oh and add guids like teams u can be on and i would play this every day sorry i know its long 😂', ""Not a bad game. But a few glitches, so I could not rate 5 stars. To be honest the skinny man in the game is very annoying. And lends very little purpose. Aldo the falling money thing in the game is distracting though I have not played the game long enough to know if you are dropping extra money (if so ty) or if he is collecting the money I have already earned. I like the plow, it gives motion to the game and it would be cool if the car did something. The guy dropping boxes most is just money. Why not upgrade stores, the annoying man, mini games would be nice to. Daily rewards. Etc. Good base but there is so much more you can do with this platform to make it more engaging. And FYI if any of my ideas are used in any way. I expect you to submit papers stating that I gave the idea, I own the idea. Not being a jerk but your game also would not stop bothering me to rate it when i have barely played the game so those are my ideas. You are welcome to email me for suggestions. Any how. The game feels a lil klunki but it's a good start."", ""Fun game played along time but... I paid for gems to start my own group. 500 gems spent and was kicked out of the group I created. i asked customer support for my gems back and was told this game is no longer supported. I will say play the game its fun if you like click games, but by no means ever pay real money for gems and don't use those gems to start a group. Also if the devs are going to keep the game an active download and take money they should at least responsed to thier in game support."", ""Won't have room for everything.. Great game most of the time... this happened before. My game progress will prestige/reset automatically, then not work. I will get my business set up and let my cash flow in, then return a couple days later. So I start with $0. I upgrade my business, buy upgrades, all that stuff. Then I will come back in another couple days after I've built up some cash. But sometimes I'll come back to see my game has reset itself to the beginning. So I lost everything. upsetting."", ""the game has issues with it that need to be looked into. it's not letting people prestige, it did not give out bonus cards after the war, it's not giving the bonus on the 100 upgrade mark on businesses. I liked this game in the beginning but if these issues do not get fixed I will have to delete the game"", 'Bought some cards last night and when I woke up this morning my cards were gone and diamonds werent returned. Tried to contact devs but email doesnt exist. .. Regular glitches and over priced diamonds means this game no longer stays on my phone, and I suggest you pass on it as well', ""It starts out okay, but after you go for prestige the first time, you basically repeat what you did before, except now you have to watch ads if you want to earn big money. Also, tapping becomes insignificant as the game progresses; it's basically just watching as many ads as possible."", 'I have played this game for years and just got it on my phone. The Cookie Clicker style of tycoon is an amazing choice, and the cards are a well thought out way to get buffs with resets.

I had no problems with the game but the hour long video wait is kinda harsh, aswell with how hard it is to get gems. I would recommend this to everyone.

Amazing game good job to the creaters and amazing game."", ""This is an amazing game with all is little funny details, the only thing I would say is, or maybe I haven't figured it out yet, is that when you unlock new items, as in hair and stuff, I unlocked a hair and didn't want it on and I don't know how to change it back.. if you can it'd be helpful if someone told me, if not maybe you could add that in :)"", ""This game is awesomely good but it needs from the developer some attention to resolve the problems on it before the players plan to leave this game. So, there's some problem that I have been noticed: 1. The dimensions of the game do not match with smartphone (the screen has slided down) Idk why but I tried more that one smartphone and I still get the same problem. 2. Why does I can't restore my old account? 3. Why does you letting us to watch ads by anger?"", 'This app is amazing. But, the reason I rate it 4 out of 5 is because I have more suggestions that would make the game better. 1: You could be able to title your vids 2: You could do giveaways to your fans 3: You could interact with real people around the world 4: You could get gems more easily These are my ideas but I think they would be great!!', 'This is game is literally about ads. And alot of ads pop up when you leave a game tab and stuff, so I bought the ""Remove all ads."" WELL OF COURSE I CANT GET ANY SURPRISE BOXES OR SKIP THE HOUR DURATION! AND NOW I HAVE TO WAIT AN HOUR FOR IT! Me as a kid, I want my money back. I paid $2 for that, and I\'m mad that nothing in this game is worth anymore... 1 STAR!!!', ""It's an amazing, fun, and adorable game. But there is one glitch I constantly run across that eggs me to not do a 5 star. Whenever I watch an add to do anything, such as speed up a production of a video, get diamonds, or some coffee, the audio cuts out of the entire game. My only solution I have found to work is to close the application and open it up, and the audio is fixed! Because of this, a lot of things are cut off from me.

When I say that, I mean that I have always wanted a YouTube channel. But, sadly, I dont have the equipment or permission from my parents. So this is very realistic and fun. I love the flying coffee and the durpy pineapple. But it takes so long to make a video and adds get old. Make it shorter and CHANGE THE ADDS!!!!! Then, you will get 5 stars. Thank you & think about it!!!', ""Hey. I would like to report a glitch in the game. After posting the first video, the internet fairy says that 'now lets buy stuff to upgrade your studio' then the screen just stays as it is. There is no action if we click anywhere. I deleted the game and downloaded it again. The same thing happened again. Please fix this bug. I can't go any further in the game because of this. Please fix this issue."", ""I really enjoy playing this game in my free time. The only flaw I came across is every time I go to dress up my character it resets my outfit to going back to the character I chose in the beggining. I usually plan on playing for 10 - 15 minutes but end up playing for like an hour. It's impossible to get bored since there are plenty of things happening. There art style is really cute witch makes the game even better. Would recomennd."", 'The game can be cool alright but I keep on losing 30% OF MY MONEY AND IT MAKES ME REALLY MAD !!!!please change it it is really annoying but the rest of the game is really good', ""I mean its a fun game to do to past time. However you guys need to chill out having all of these ads. I can click on something then a random ad pop up. That cute little mail person keep coming back every 10 secs when I don't even want it. Let the little mail person come back in like 10 mins not every 10 secs. In other words, these abs are like in our faces and it gets annoying, it's like window 7 virus. You guys are the second app game I had to complain about with this stuff"", 'This game really brings back so many fun memories~ I was super happy to find this game again, but I WASNT happy finding out how ad happy it became. I completely understand needing money for your work, but receiving 50 unskippable ads in half an hour really takes the fun out of the game for me. Could you perhaps make the ads less frequent? Or maybe, only have ads for boosts and extra diamonds or what have you? You would still get alot of revenue from doing so, and less annoyance from customers.♡\ufeff', ""I've played this game in the past, loved it, and accidentally forgot about it. I've been missing out on this game, as it's been one of the best mobile games I've ever p,ayed, if not THE best! I like it because of its simplicity, as well as how it basically lets you do whatever and it helps you with it. (I.E. leaving and coming back, it welcomes you back and tells you what you missed. Staying on and playing will reward you with various bonus items that may appear, etc.)"", ""This game is the BEST!❤️ I got it when I was at San Diego And I've playing it a lot recently. There's no clickbait! Other like games where the ad says you can draw your own cart thing or whatever but really, In reality, You can't. YOU CAN ACTUALLY EXPIERIENCE BEING VIRTUAL! It's always been my dream to be a Virtual Royale High Roblox Youtube + Minecraft. But, i never had the chance. But, this game let me.

It's do fun and interactive, you can collect and earn cool clothes, furniture, pets, and topics for your videos! You can also earn and collect Viral Points to win competitions and get a lot of amazing prizes! You can also create the name of your YouTube channel, you can get followers and earn different YouTube plaques, you can also get a bunch of viewers, and with those viewers, you can buy furniture, clothing, pets, and different topics!😍"", ""I honestly wasn't sure about this game at first, however as I played it I became more addicted. Its truly a very enjoyable game. I personally think you should add more locations to do videos in like go on holiday and get more views but u have to buy it with coins or something. Overall an amazing enjoyable game."", ""I love it ! It's fun, it has very beautiful decorations, cute pets and avatars it's amazing but it would be better if we could write our own vlog not that i don't like the topics i still want that but with our writing and customizing our own merchandise and maybe making some mini games and also voting other peoples video i know we could vote on lives but also commenting and voting other peoples vlog would be more fun !!! Pls add this up to the update as soon as possible !!!!! Plspls!!!"", ""Ads, ads, ads. This game spams you with ads for in-game rewards, but in addition there a random 30 second ads that don't give a reward. My favourite part was when there were 3 things on my screen telling me up watch ads and I had to choose which one gave me the best benefit. The usage of in-game currency is limited, as there are many items that require direct money payments. Keep the game away from kids or people with poor money handling skills. Otherwise, play it while doing something else."", ""There are two bugs that i've spotted while playing: -watching an ad will completely mute audio when returning to the main game and going to options will not affect this -aftering passing 50 million subscribers, the play button will continue to move right as the bar supposedly is still moving right as well, despite appearing to stop, and it will even go behind the gem count and menu. not sure if these bugs are unique to me but i just wanted to share this. game is decent :)"", 'I love to play the game in my spare time and I thought of a new topic idea too: Animation. The icon could be a stickman controlled by a mouse. Similar to Animator vs Animation by Alan Becker. But they is a negative too, a bug what removes all sound from the game. (Except Advertisements) Can happen if you watch a reward advertisements.', 'The first I laid my eyes on this game, I said to my self, ""Hmm let me try this game for a bit!"" so when I opened the game its seemed like a good start, but when I got even further, it even got better! Graphics, 5 stars. Gameplay, 5 stars. Controls, nothing but 5 stars!!! I tried to tell it to my friends but they never listened. Probably is because they didn\'t have any free time. The next time I\'ll text them and hopefully they install it and tell it to their friends! I\'m saying THIS IS THE BEST!!', ""Loved It at First, But... I started playing this game on December 9. At first, nothing had happened when I was playing the game. It was quite fun, actually, but since December 13 and 15, the app kept closing on its own, and I didn't know why. I first thought it was because I had synched with a Facebook account, but I then tried to see if I can uninstall just to make sure. Once I found the issue, I was shocked. Not only did my stuff not synched correctly, but my user was also the same before. 3."", ""It is a really good game. But there are way too many ads shown. It's life I'm watching ads every minute. Normally, this wouldn't matter to me, but it does ads that even if you don't press anything at the end of the add it takes you straight to the appstore, they have adds that make you wait thirty seconds only to find out you need to wait another fifteen for the X to load. It's so annoying and they show the same add pretty much every time. Plz fix. I will re-install when it is fixed. Please fix."", ""I think the game is good overall. I have an issue where in the tutorial where I talk to the fairy when switching screens and I am kicked out of the screen but, the fairy keeps talking. Now I can't recive comments from veiwers and it's driving me MAD!!! Otherwise the game is great just please fix the bugs in the game."", ""This game is amazing!!! The graphics or 100% the best thing I've ever seen, gameplay is smooth and easy to play, sooooo addicting and easy to play! One thing you can change though is the phone power up things; so it can remind you that the boost is done and the spam of notifications. But other than that, this game is AMAZING and I 100% want you to play it's it's garunteed to be addicting and at least make you smile! Oh, and I hope sometime soon you can add more topics! Thanks for reading! 😀😀😀"", ""The game is fun! I really encourage you to get it! It's free ( except for in game purchase ) and easy to play. One thing that annoyed me is that if you don't rate the game it comes up so many times, but I think it is really good and they should keep doing what they are."", ""When I started playing the game... I was OBSESSED like literally obsessed I couldn't stop playing. It even got to the extent when i was playing while crossing the road. But after like a day or 2, l came back to the game, and the amount of ads it had was insane, like literally insane. Every single time i tried to click something an ad would show up, and there's this really annoying ad that comes and after it's finished it takes me straight to the Play Store! Good game, TOO MANY ads!! 4 stars❤\U0001f929💝"", 'I love this game. It\'s super fun and I love how you can do so much more than just make videos. My only problem is that every time I watch an ad for prizes, I come back to the game and it\'s super slow and freezes constantly. Please fix this problem. Also, when you are checking comments and accidentally ""like"" a mean comment or ""dislike"" a nice comment, it minuses way too much of your progress in the bar at the bottom. This is really annoying. But I still love this game.', ""I like this game, but however, no one is perfect. Many things are so expensive and I noticed that you have to tap on the screen for over 59 minutes and if not, the process is very slow. Well, you can minus some minutes and make a tap booster if you want in the next update. Also make some other topics to make videos on. Otherwise it's a cute game to play!"", 'This really is an amzing and addictive app, no joke. Its not exacy the game to play if you are looking for something to do in a short time period, but otherwise its great. There are quite a few ads, but most of them give you rewaerds, so ot is tolerable. The game can get a bit boring and tedious...which is why I unistalles it. Overall, decnt game.', ""I love the game... I am pretending like am a vlogger ....my dream is to have a YouTube channel but my parents won't allow me to do.... at last I got this game which my friend had told me to download love it very much..... thank you very much for this app.... it has nice graphics every single thing which a YouTubeer wants. ........but the big problem is we need to keep on pressing or we have to wait until the video gets finished...but anyways this is the best game ever I have seen in the playstor"", 'This game is cute and fun and I really enjoyed and it also captures the way a YouTuber feels Time to time (im a small YouTuber myself), if you guys can just add more clothing options and the ability to move things around in your room then this game would be perfect, but I would still recommend it no matter what', ""Fun to play, and I love enjoy the outfits that aren't available kinda wish there was more video game based outfits, and maybe a category for other animals like fish, or parrots or how to videos the icon could be a hammer. Overall I believe that the game is pretty good. My little brother likes to help me tap the screen when he's bored so that is a pretty good thing too."", ""Great game! Although there is one thing wrong, when your making a video and the mail person comes and you watch an ad after that the music and sound is gone, I go to settings and they were atimaticly turned off I turn it back on and there's still no sound. So I exit the game and go back to it and the sound is back on, but can you please fix this? Overall it's a really fun game! 👍"", ""I have played this game before and it is Super Ultra Awesome according to me . I had uninstalled the game long ago and downloaded it recently. But this time I am not being able to pass the tutorial. I could play up-to publishing my first video and then when it came to the next tutorial part, in which we have to open the shop, the shop button won't come. I am not being able to play the game. Please fix this problem."", ""It's really enjoyable especially if you're just looking for something to pass the time. However sometimes when I earn things for my avatar have no idea where they end up and searching through the endlessly locked options takes forever. If there was maybe a separate section of things you owned, it would be extremely useful. Otherwise, I don't have any complaints."", 'I really like it! It is a very good app, the reason I eater it 4 starts is because I want the game to have more pets,merch,boxes and more games for your pug to sell! But I really like the game, but I hope they will add these updates!', 'This game is literally sooo fun to play!! I love the little details in the game and love how you can pick what you look like,what kind of gameplay you do and how you can change it at any time and love the fairy in the tutorial!! Keep up the good work!!', 'Its such a gr8 game, i just really love the animation and it really satisfies you when the screen says, "" You received 800 followers!"", i cant really explain it but i can tell you that this game is so fun....i recommend you get it and PLAY!!!!!😁😁.', ""I had this game on my old phone about a year or two ago and I liked it a lot, I was going through the play store today and saw so I decided to get it. It is a lot to get coins them I remember though XD I only have one problem with it which I hope can be fixed. So basically everytime I watch an ad to get like coffee or diamond or something else, the ad will have sound but the game will for some reason mute unless you completely exit out if it and go back in.

Don't bother buying till the bugs are patched."", 'Don\'t get me wrong, this game is good, but it\'s missing so much. The story is great, but way too short for a paid game. When I finished I thought ""... Was that it?"" No newgame+, no endgame, just kinda boring.', ""Cute game, but very short. Generally, I look to clicker/idle games for something that I can play in microbursts over long periods. Unfortunately, even mostly using the idle mechanics, the game's story only lasted about three days. That said, it was a cute and enjoyable little story. SPACEPLAN is well put together, stylish, and just plain neat; I just wish there was more of it."", ""Thought this was okay. The story is funny but pretty basic, and unless you're willing to put up with a clicker for 4 hours, the ending ends up feeling a little underwhelming for the mindless time that you have to put in to earn it."", 'Must be my favorite mobile game by now, just behind Meonumental Valley. It has a fun, stupid, really cool story (or sort of story) a very simple gameplay, and awesome music. It is exactly what a good mobile game should be.', 'The sad part is I own this game on PC and its incredible. The mobile version is also incredible. However whatever happened to the game that caused the mobile version to black out is very unfortunate.', ""This is the best clicker I've ever played probably. It's got a compelling and funny story and everything. Has a smooth UI too."", 'Graphics, music, idea is really nice. But, God! Staring at the wall is more entertaining - mechanics and engaging with the player is completely absent. Comeon!', ""I really enjoyed it, it's very interesting and the story is funny. The ending was on a whole other level, unexpected and very cool."", 'Lovely game with brilliant design. Very enjoyable and great concept. I just wish I could replay it for the first time again, a truly magical experience.', ""Great game, with a gamebreaking bug. Somehow it has reset my game two times within two days. It's annoying to start over and over again."", ""It was a lovely experience until I got to the second level. Unresponsive black screen. Tried killing the app, reinstalling, cleared cache and data. Can't recommend this until the critical error is fixed."", ""So far I've been loving it, however recently the game just boots up, plays the cutscene with the potato people, and sits at an endless loading screen while playing music. What happened and how can I fix this??"", ""Decent game but I beat it in 36 hours. Absolutely awful for a game I had to pay for. Don't waste your money on this game."", 'Good while it lasted, beat the game in 2 days. Definately the best clicker i have ever played, but the game is so short.', 'Amusing and interesting, with decent pacing. Unfortunately, an incremental game that only lasts two and a half days misses the mark.', ""SUPER interesting concept, major let down when it's all over. Yeahhh if youre into incremental games and don't mind a short one, definitely buy this. If you're expecting a long idle game, this isn't for you, especially for $3"", 'Just a gorgeous, wonderful little idle clicker with a fascinating story. Simply a great game design idea done very well. Support these devs! Such a unique experience.', 'I love this game so much because at first it seems like all other games but than turns around and explodes with fun in your face.', ""Loved the graphics and easy going story, which kept me coming back again and again. But I'm a little confused about the ending. It rolled final credits, but felt like it was missing something."", 'It\'s a fun and interesting clicker. There was so much build up to an epic third act with a grander scope (was expecting ""eldritch potato grannies"") but it sort of fell flat at the end. Otherwise it was a nice weekend time-waster.', ""I have never left a review for a game before, but this amazed me. I usually get clicker games for some mindless entertainment and dopamine rush, and uninstall after an hour when I get bored, but you can hardly call this a clicker. It has an amazing narrative and an ending so you don't feel like youre wasting time for nothing. The story was absolutely awesome, very metaphysical and great for anyone who likes to entertain the idea of infinite realities. The game took about 3 days to complete, but only because you do have to wait. That being said, the ending is well worth the wait. One of the most moving and chilling, visually beautiful movies. I even took a couple screenshots for backgrounds. They also give you the option to replay the ending or start the game over completely. At first, the game may seem uninspiring and limited, but after a couple hours of playing it evolves into something completely different than you previously thought. I picked it up on sale for a dollar but its well worth full price. For any fans of clickers, space, metaphysics, and witty banter, this is a must have game."", ""Great short little game. It wasn't exactly what I thought it would be. It seemed like a regular idle game but it actually was a story-oriented one. Enjoyed it a lot!"", 'So much fun, just frustratingly short. I ended up beating it in about a day or so. I really wish it was longer or you could randomize or something! Otherwise it was incredible.', ""What an amazing game. It's a clicker, but with an actual story that feels very interactive. And the ending, (yes there is an actual ending to this game) oh, what an ending. I watched... er... listened to it at least four times. The music in the game is amazing as well. Over all, I cannot recommend this game enough. Although, it was kind of quick to finish."", 'Very much an experience as well as a game. Really creative outside of the usual clicker experience. SciFi is akin to topics covered in the movie Interstellar, which I loved. Only complaint is that it is pretty short for a clicker (took me less than 2 days), but that is likely due to it being narrative driven than just a grindfest. Would recommend for people who like space fiction!', 'When I found the free version just liked this but I was interested in the payed version so when i beat the game, the ending made me sad. Its a good game, but before you buy try the free version on krongregate', 'For those with black screen issue: give the game more time to load also keep your screen from shutting off by keeping a finger on it as it may take longer for older phone to load. P.s. great game ! I wish it was longer ;)', ""Quite possibly one of the best incremental games. I've never played a game as good as this. What make it stand out is the story and gameplay elements. The ending was amazingly crafted especially with the music. I had always been really interested in playing Spaceplan but never could because of its price, but after buying and completing it, it was worth it."", 'If other mobile games put as much thought into their entire development as this game has put into any single aspect (story, graphics, music, bunny cameos, juicyness, etc) then the mobile marketplace would be a much better place. This game has ended clicker games for me. Nothing will beat this. I leave it on so that I can listen to the music, I check in so I can see what witticisms my onboard computer has come up with, I idly watch that little planet rotate in a state of zen. Worth every penny.', ""Probably the coolest mobile game I've played in recent memory. Also does a great job of pacing the story and game for mobile."", ""A really enjoyable game. One of my favorites, definitely. There's a pleasant bit of whimsy to it in addition to the excellent game play."", 'Can only get a black screen. I was happy to pay after playing on PC but I would honestly never recommend it since it broke for me immediately and I just cant do anything with it.', ""I played through this delightful little clicker over the course of two days on a lake trip. While I was initially a bit confused as to how the gameplay loop worked, I quickly figured things out and found myself checking in on my progress a few times every hour until I finished. While it won't be for everyone, the reasonable price is worth the risk. I really enjoyed this game.""]"

While idle mining games are popular, the game adds multiple unique features that make it stand out against the rest as a unique idea, I won't say too much as I think it's best for others to try and discover themselves! It also has great ad placement. It is a worthwhile game experience. However the progress could use a bit more balance, I feel like after the first little bit it feels very stagnant and players may lose interest."", ""This is one of my favourite games. I love the story but the costs to upgrade your panel becomes ridiculous. When in times of need though your guild mates are there for you. This is a very creative game. I would 100% recommend it and I already told a bunch of people about. I'd like a friends list though rather then just the guilds but overall this is a amazing game. I can't wait for sandship."", ""The game is fun, but after a while It takes far too long to upgrade your spells because of the time it takes to get resources. Edit - yeah, that's understandable but at the same time, the time it takes for things to be crafted or built. I just think the recipes needed should be edited to be able to acquire them or be able to buy them with coins via player clans or visitation."", ""A really enjoyable storyline sets this semi-idle clicker apart from the competition. It feels like genuine exploration and progression with a purpose. Hats off to the developers. If I had one gripe, it would the deployment time for new mines/other platforms, which is the only thing preventing me from giving this 5 stars; I'm relatively early into the game and with only half of the available areas occupied by mining platforms, I'm already having to wait 28 hrs to deploy a basic mine..."", ""Ok, so the most annoying thing that has caused me to uninstall, was the corrupted layers. The freezing of the layer takes WAY too long to reload and the layer regenerates WAY TOO FAST for it to be worth my effort, clicking on the damn laser, which takes a couple seconds to reload as well', on top of it all. For that reason alone (regardless of all the upgrades'), I'm out. Super sad because the art & animation is AMAZING, the music and audio is GREAT & this game has SO MUCH POTENTIAL. PLEASE FIX!"", 'Simple mining gathering devloping creating game, nothing more nothing less, save your starting special currency it will help later, after a day or two becomes a huge waiting game, 8 hour builds and so on, like the rest. But unlike the rest i like this one. My actual games are satisfactory, factorio, fallout 3 4 and 76, (ex) wow, farcry (all of them), 7 days to die, so needless to say this game scratches an itch. Pop on for a bit, check me stuff, build some stuff, sell some stuff, mine some stuff', ""Pretty fun game. It's one is the longer playing games I've had. It doesn't get into these impossible pay-to-play cycles. It really quite good for what I'm looking for. Minor: sometimes the graphics get into a fight with system graphics. Update: lost a few stars because the ads are 2-3 times more prolific making it annoying and burdensome. In time, I expect to lose interest because I'm just watching ads all the time."", ""Frequent updates, guild events, and a live player base. It's a unique twist on the idea of an idle game. There's no forced ads, you choose if you want to watch that ad. It's not perfect like every game, it has its share of in app purchases which come with most mobile games."", 'Please fix this small problem. Titanium ore is given way before we are given the option to make titanium so your stuck at the same level and damage until your able to make titanium which makes it hard to fight the oil monster because it spams the heal ability all the time so it makes it difficult to even bring it down even for a bit. Though i do like and enjoy the game', 'I love this game and how it gives you cool facts periodically and how the bot interacts with you! Way better than any mining game I have ever played. Interesting storyline, incorporating real science facts, creative bosses, and the graphics really tie this game together <3 The only complaints I have about the game are that renaming drones is a little buggy and that the touch controls are not always accurate. Other than that, this game is amazing!', 'The game itself is very fun. Can be an excellent time killer as well as a great idle game. My problem is with the lack of explanation (ie ""panel level"" is actually ""weapon level"", no way to mine platinum which is a required resource). And the idle feature of creating objects isnt 100%. I spent 2 days creating objects only to have them disappear after 2 days with no explanation. Fix the bugs and add clarity for 5 stars!', ""The game is good overall, but the time it takes to deploy miners really bothers me. In my opinion, it should not take double the amount of time as last time. Maybe make it increase by 10 minutes up to a few hours, and as a trade off, price doubles. It's just super annoying that sometimes in order to expand, you need to wait days for new miners."", 'Playing 2 ads at once, one over the top of the other so muting one still has the audio playing on the background ad. This is either a huge rort or a bug. Not only that, but free chests and drops are all ad based. This is literally like digging for ads. No thanks! I understand ads being used for generating revenue, but not when it takes over the entire game. You screw yourself over progress wise by not viewing ads. What a feral way of making games.', ""I actually really love the game! Its got a cool story and fun management. It gives you enough 'elite' currency that you dont feel left out and frustrated. However, it does get super super long on wait times FAST. Then you dont have the paid currency because you used it on upgradimg your bots and you end up having to wait 3 days to play the game again because all your bots are building. If I could fix anything, it would be the scaling wait times. Theres already scaling currency/pricing."", ""This is how you make a tap game with optional ads. Seriously been trying to find a tap game I can enjoy without pop up ads but gives you the option if you so choose, which I usually do. That aside it's an enjoyable game that you can pick up and put down, love it"", 'Much better b2ow since the updates. Can take awhile for certain tasks and getting enough coins late game but now i want to finish the story. 2/2020 - logged back into the game after a few months and I have lost all of my progress ofter opening the observatory, exploring asteroids and upgrading past 440 to open up a new area. Now none of it is available, the observatory has disappeared and it is locked.', ""Ok I've played this game for a while ( A couple years) and as I go to open it it opens closes then when I open it again I'm back at square 1 and no matter how many times I've signed in and out of Google play it still won't put me back to where I started. But everything else is good."", 'Everything else is five stars, reason for 4 stars on actual review is that i find it frustrating when you need a certain amount of something you cant just select how much of that item you want to craft when you log off so when you come back all your copper, steel, ect. Is all gone. I know that its kinda part of the game but i would like it if before i go to sleep at night i could craft without using all my materials. Also make crafting table accessable while its upgrading.', ""Fun game, but for the past two days I've constantly received this glitch where an upgrade that would usually take 10-15 hours automatically turns into around to 24 or 36 hours I want to keep enjoying this game but the added on time for no reason at all is making it hard."", 'Only took about 3 weeks to get to the point where everything is either too expensive or takes to long to build, without spending cash. After your ~10 mining platform it takes 48hrs to build 1 with the cost doubling each time. To speed that up in real money would cost $50 each not to mention the exponential price. I honistly forgot about this game till today.', ""Edit to Dev: 3+ day wait time is not a challenge. Try playing your own game. Wouldn't recommend (11 days playing). Cons: 1. Very slow game and is a rip off of a planet mining game. 2. The steps of increase in wait times are huge. 3. On day 6 reached aluminum, first new crafting material since day 1 but upgrades limited by this material. 4. Quest rewards are poor, almost no returns for spent material. Current build time per mine is over 3+ days. Pros: 1. Nice aesthetic 2...."", ""Enjoyable management game that is a 'breath of fresh air' from other games that seemed to only be designed to shove ads down the players throat. Minimal as intrusion that allows one to take pleasure in playing, rather than watching a nauseating array of ads just to get ahead in the game."", ""Such an immersive game with a matching soundtrack. I've logged so many hours with headphones on this adventure. Keep coming out with more content; it's already totally a new game from when I last played!"", 'I was angry when I left my last comment. I went to the rockbitegames support I didn\'t understand what to do. I can\'t get rid of the uranium elder at level ?863? I used red, green lasers miracle gas and bombs. It takes a long while to make the 40 glass tumblers of refined oil plus I am on a fixed income (soc.sec.) I can\'t afford to pay $$ to make it shorter. How do I get rid of the uranium elder? I\'d like to keep playing the game it\'s amusing How do you open ""a support ticket?""', ""It's a good game. Idle with a nice story, but time and costs to build new station grows a lot, takings days to build just one! Same for the upgrades. If times and costs get a little readjustment, game will be perfect"", 'The start was boring, before crafting was unlocked. I almost uninstalled. After crafting it became a very fun management game. Anyone that likes crafting, planning, he might like this game. Just need to push through the early part.', ""Awesome! I'm sorry to say but Liam Gabriel valley, and in a chance of the only way I didn't want it is the only one that place for me and running a position where the best way for me. Idle E is that it will take time since I've been playing this game Ugh I'm so sorry for a while. E is the first place! I'm sorry to the only thing that is not just talking to one was a teenager I love the best of my friends and family. Idle E Is Plat S, but it is the first place for a while ago. I Didn't"", ""It's an idle miner with a story, its pretty good composted to games like miner dig deep or steam dig. Some complaints on the explanation of the different parts of the game, but its pretty easy to figure out if you're not paying attention at some parts."", 'This game has too much emphasis on monetization. I understand that people want to make money but I also have to actually want to play the game for you to get that money. Way too ad based and pay to win. Edit: knocked off another star. Trying to minimize my opinion with a response is tacky at best.', 'Great game worth 4.8 stars at least for gameplay and fun. I like that it can be played offline. Support also fixed an issue regarding a purchase. Wish guilds had a bit more validity/purpose. Overall gameplay is a nice balance of active and idle play.', ""Oh yes, folks! This IS the game you've been looking for! It has it all- resource management, base building, weapon upgrades, crafting, quests, and more!"", 'Started well. But wait times becone absurdly long, and ways to make money become less rewarding and more convoluted to force/entice/cajole you to spend money. All in all.. pretty boring.', ""Fantastic game. Could use some better translation work, as the English can sometimes be a little awkward, but that's a minor point in a brilliant game."", 'Decent game. Would like the ability to downgrade or sell mining/oil platforms. Also a recent issue where ads only run for a few seconds, then close without giving rewards.', ""The game has an appealing aspect which makes it a good time waster. There is one issue though. The water collector won't collect water. It filled up overnight, I claimed it and it won't start filling up. Please help!!"", ""Best game ever BTW, there's a little bug When you are at the drone bay and you press on a bot, who is collecting mining resources the 'Floor' thingy will stay there, under the 'Area' thingy"", 'So i had a play store issue and i ended up resolving it. I reinstall the game to come and find i come from fighting the emerald elder which is area 72 and i ended up beinh reseted back to area 52 and every building i have built is gone..', ""great game. but please make saving of game data better. there's no way to tell if saving is complete. maybe show the date and timestamp of last save."", 'This was a 5 star game but after a phone switch it had reset my progress back to before the Halloween event so i have lost both a Halloween item christmas item and my progress I submitted a report with no reply if the issue can be resolved I will change back to 5 stars', ""Good time killer, very addicting. Only gripe is that later in the game it's much harder to keep enough money available for upgrading building etc and the timer for upgrades can be annoyingly long""]"

The ads that would pop up every now and then we're annoying but not terrible since you could imstantly close them. Since the latest update the ads couldn't be closed but you had to sit and wait. I gave it the benefit of a doubt but after it happened 3 times in a row I hit uninstall. Not going back. Stay away."", 'This game is ...OK....a few things are annoying....like the constant adverts that seem to appear when you do anything or click on anything, and the game maths for the guard is well off...if I double 11 hours by watching a video how does that equal 15 hours? and if I double that again how can that be 19 hours? But I love the cartoon style graphics and the game play is easy....will I be playing this in 1 or two months time.........probably not...sorry', 'I honestly love this game. The only reason I\'m not giving it 5 stars is cause I had decided to splurge a little and get the ""Great Hell Offer"" for $19.99, only to get nothing but a charge to bank account for it. I figured maybe it\'s a glitch and gave it a couple days, still nothing. When I go to settings and click ""Contact Us"" the app just freezes which means I can\'t contact anyone about it. In short, the game took $20 from, gave me nothing in return, and this is the only place I can report it.', ""Income is wildly inconsistent. I leveled my 8th place to 98, with the guard enabled it's bringing in about 500-600bb. A couple moments before I didn't have the guard enabled and was a couple levels lower and was bringing in 2cc. It also frequently doesn't give the full amount of what it said I accumulated while away after clicking on each spot. This could easily have been one of my favorite time killers if it wasn't for this flaw."", ""I was enjoying this until the game suddenly and unexpectedly reset itself right to the start, as though I hadn't played it before. Not the boss apple reset, but complete reset causing me to lose all my progress which had taken me ages to get to. Not happy. It just reset itself randomly overnight. I opened the game today to find my progress has all gone."", 'Can NOT get anything if it requires watching a video first. Game ALWAYS says there is no internet connection!! Missed out on a LOT of extra staff and bonuses because the game is faulty. Would give 5 stars if this was fixed!!! Not worth playing because you NEED the staff you cant get due to the ""no internet"" fault in the game!!!!!', ""Was a good game until everything stopped working. Upgrade page keeps disappearing, I have to keep restarting phone just to get it back. The ads don't always work and the guard keeps disappearing after an ad if the ad works. I'm not the only person that has stated this is happening yet you the developers do nothing. How do you expect people to play your games if you don't listen to them and rectify what is wrong when informed about it. This games needs to be fixed and checked properly before you put out updates"", 'Fun game but you\'re killing me with ads. Edit, understood that ads \'help your project exist"", but seriously, this is overkill. You should not spend more time watching ads then playing the game. So far, you all havent motivated me to want to pay for the upgrade. We are given an opportunity to double are profits in the beginning, watch ad, then you\'re given a number of souls that dont even get added to your total! You have no explanation of how the game works. More to say but not enough space.', ""Great game, very addictive with an attractive look. My only suggestions for improvement would be to make the upgrading system clearer by putting each work place's number next to the workplace image on the main screen so you know which one you are upgrading and to include an option for adding in-game friends so that if you don't have any real life friends who wish to play then you can add other people who are also playing the game so you don't miss out on that aspect of the game."", ""I like to play a game for a day or so before giving my review. I really like what they've done with it! Are there ads? Yes but no more than similar games! Is it ftp? Yes! Then expect ads to help the devs cover expenses so they can keep making it even better! If you don't like ads then go purchase the product version for less than $1 and quit whining!"", ""And the Point of the Game Is? The graphics are amusing and the game is fun to play for a week, but then I'm just left wondering what the point is. Sure, most games don't have a point to them, but there are at least there are some clear goals. It seems all you do is unlock new areas, going round and round the same set of clicks. Maybe that is the point, you create a personal hell, repeating the same actions every day with no goal or reward."", 'It doesnt collect apples if you close the app. Hence you cannot progress if you dont do the same things for 3 hours.. only if it would progress even when i am not playing only then i can give a 5 star. Comolete waste of time.', ""doesn't save progress. played for quite a while yesterday and when I came back to it today it lost all progress. there are time-wasters and there are wastes of time. this is the latter. glad I didn't spend any money on this (though they did get paid for all the ads I watched)."", ""Somethings gone wrong. I love this game, helps a lot with my anxiety being able to just focus on my tiny phone demons, but tonight (in the last 2 hours) I've had the boss summoned randomly and not being able to click off or cancel it. I've started from scratch 5 times in the last 2 hours and it's ridiculous. I tried the contact us button in the app but it just freezes my game.""]"

Note 1: Own Coffee Shop is an idle game. Some people also call it a clicker game. You just need to tap or click on your phone's screen to invite the customer. When you progress in the game, you can upgrade the items to make customer comes automatically even when you're idle or away, so you won't have to tap or click on the screen too often. (You can still tap or click on the screen to fasten your progress of course!)

Note 2: Own Coffee Shop sometimes use ""Idle Game"" or ""Clicker Game"" at the end of the name. But we're still the same game, since both idle game and clicker game define the general gameplay of Own Coffee Shop. But don't worry, we can assure you that Own Coffee Shop is more than just a general idle or clicker game. Just give it a shot! XD

Note 3: Own Coffee Shop: idle game (or Own Coffee Shop clicker game) is a free game but does offer in-app purchases of various kinds.

Note 4:
We need several permission to run this game:
1. WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE - this is needed to create screen capture to be shared to your friends.
2. READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE - this is to save your internet data consumption for ads.
These permission will not be used without your approval.

If this helps at all I use a samsung galaxy 10E with the latest software update there is.', ""This is a rewrite of the previous review, this game has some awesome progress guys, keep it up, idk how hasn't this game reached the top 3 best tapping games in the app. I mean look at this, you own a coffee shop, you can decorate it, make lots of money, get awesome items and lastly, the content is pretty consistent for a relatively small team??? I do not know how many people work on this game."", ""The games has an adorable design to it, easy to play and understand, and quite the effort for a tap game. Awesome, but the one thing I hate is the fact when you buy cookies the cookie display in the counter isn't rendered; just a wooden block. Needs a fixing!"", 'Love this game sooooo verrrryy addicting! ""Update"" iv been playing this AWSOME game since i got it. One thing id like to see is a rebirth system for the main shop. Other than that this game is spectakular. It deserves 100 stars!. But i can only give 5.

It clicks about half an inch above where I need it to, so I can't even complete the tutorial. I would love to play this game if it was physically possible to, though. UPDATE: After trying it again with fixed controls, I thinks it's amazing!!!"", 'Good clicker, but: 1. Lack of auto-click option makes it tiring; 2. The interface is far from perfect, and it even takes a while to load between the in-game tabs for some reason; 3. Dialogues are long and boring, too many daily missions, and some other minor problems. There is a game in this exactly same sub-genre called ""Illuminatti"", which doesnt have any of the problems above, learn how to improve this game from it.', ""I love this game I really do, classical clicker and you sell coffee. It works well most of the time. Recently I put my 3 best drinks into my truck (which I got through a legendary crate and waited 24 hours to open) and exited the game. When I reentered, they were all gone, all my progress with the truck was gone, my saved up 80 golden beans from all the side quests were down to zero and my skills were taken away. I put in my next best 3 and the same thing happened again, is there any way to fix this glitch or get my drinks back or at the very least be able to keep the progress I've made without starting over every time I go into the game??"", ""Good game, but I lost a lot of progress in my game for some reason after saving over an old cloud save. A whole week's worth of progress. All the upgrades I got reverted, all the missions I started disappeared, I had to restart the New Year's event, all the limited edition items I got disappeared. Every single one. I even lost progress in the main story. Don't know what the hell happened."", ""Best game Ive played in a long time! A+ Great graphics and controls. Super cute character's and storyline. It's just challenging enough to where it's not boring, but easy enough to where you're not having to spend real cash to actually play a game. It doesn't overly advertise or have a bunch of pop ups. Plus I love coffee & get to learn while I play! The only problem I have so far is it will not connect to own connect, even though my username and password are correct. Is there any solution?"", ""I love this game, it's nice to play while doing other things around the house or when passing time, the only thing is I cannot access Mr. Mavens cart, it was there when I first started and didn't have any beans but as soon as I got enough to use the cart disappeared. I've checked every tab and he hasn't shown back up! Other than that, the game works and looks great"", ""Great idle sim. Nothing ground breaking but it's premise and art direction gives it charm. Purchases can be made for special decos and 'boosts' like in every other idle sim. There're events of different tier. The higher tiers are absurd unless you spend hours tapping away.. Decorations are odd. The menus are fixed to a certain height and obstructed by the roof. Not sure what the metal menu bars are for if nothing can be placed there either. As far as balance goes, the early to mid game's good but it's badly skewed toward the latter half of the game when trillions come into play. You could end up waiting for months or possibly years as there's only so much offline/automatic collection could do. As a guide, idle sims should not require more than a week of waiting per upgrade. 3 days is ideal, 1 or 2 weeks occasionally is fine. Despite the critism, it's worth trying the game out for a few months before you hit that break wall in upgrades. (Anything past 100billion)"", ""Guys, there's a problem with the buttons. Fix it ffs, nobody can play this beautiful game. The problem is that the game is not very responsive. When you press a button, for me it was the upgrade buttons (and apparently every freaking button), you must be lucky if the game registered that touch. Please fix it. Otherwise it is a good game and I will update the review with 5 stars after you get it fix. Have a good day and drink your coffee."", ""Can't upload my progress. How will you fix that?"", 'Love this game! Cute, great sounds with clean and cosy graphics. The issue that stopped me from playing is the difficulty of simply pressing buttons (it takes a few taps to click on something) but that could also be my phone(doubted). The main issue of deterring me from playing is when I sold my coffee truck for the second time, but my bonuses were wiped. I had to start with no bonuses again and it was frustrating. (Also my frappes disappeared except for the ones im using in the main shop) Great game overall, however the wiped bonuses and frappes frustrated me.', 'It\'s a cute game and fun to play when I\'m bored, but like many other users I have issues with the frappes and the truck. My frappes are said to be ""in use"" but are actually gone and not helping my revenue. The truck resets to the first level and my multiplier from selling it disappears. My idle money also stopped coming in, so I only make revenue from clicking and special customers.', ""Own Coffee Shop is a cute idle game. The art is nice and the story is relatively easy to follow despite some rocky translations here and there. The only reason this review isn't for five stars is that the game has suddenly stopped working after an update and uninstalling and reinstalling has not helped. If you can get the game to work then I recommend giving it a try."", ""I'd probably give it a higher rating of the game actually worked. Any time I tap the screen it registers as almost half an inch higher than it should, which makes it so I can't reach the upgrade menu, mission menu or any of the other vital functions at the bottom of the screen. I've waited almost a month for an updated on a game breaking bug is unacceptable. Bugs happen, but this is ridiculous."", ""For all this game is very good, but I have to point out one bug that has been bugging me for the past few days. Basically whenever I try and click on buy lovebirds or lecturer, basically it will take me to you know the screen where you meet important characters like e.g Mr Safe, Mr Sound and Becca but it will stay there the music will keep playing the character would keep moving even Tako would I will keep moving but the lovebirds/lecturer never come please change this so I can keep playing the game and don't worry, if you do this I will rate it 5 Stars again and delete this comment, thank you."", ""cute game, but there's a few things wrong in my opinion. just because something is obvious to YOU doesn't mean it's obvious to everyone. might try giving more of an explanation about where things are located (coffee pot) 10 stages for an upgrade, not really cool but hey, it's your game not mine so do as you choose. have a wonderful day"", ""The game was great and I loved it when it was newer, and recently I couldn't even do anything in the menu. Every time I tried to access anything in the menu the game would freeze. I hope this gets fixed because overall it was a fun game that I loved to play. Oh yeah, and I tried to load a previous saved game of mine but it just rewrote it so my new game was the one that was saved instead so I couldn't play on the saved game I worked on before."", ""I've used this app before on other phones, but the app won't even launch on my Google Pixel. I'm unsure if it's because it's just not compatible or what, but please fix this. I've loved this game for a while and I've played it on previous phones I've owned in the past. This is one of my favorite idle games and it makes me sad not to be able to pass the time in my own little cafe 😭 Edit: I tried downloading and playing this again since the Jan 23rd update and it still isnt working ;-;"", ""I really like this game. The art style is amazing and very cute! Though I would like to have the ability to change your coffee shop name. I misspelled a word and since I can't change the name it stayed like that and it's very annoying. Edit: There's also this one weird thing that happened: where can I use magical raw coffee beans? I have quite a few, but can't find a way to use them. I'm pretty sure I should have access to the cart, since I'm quite advanced in the game."", ""This game was pretty good. Had a nice art style and good concept. Basically a tapping game where the more you tap on the screen the more coffee you serve. I enjoyed this but after some time it gets a bit boring. Overall it's a great game but not really something to keep on your phone forever. Definitely recommend."", 'It\'s really cute and I\'d love to play more but there isn\'t much ""idle"" game play. It is active game play, and resorts mostly to constant clicking. There is not a steady system as you upgrade your store that continues to produce money FOR you, but rather it all relies on your clicking for the most part. If you want to close the game or step away, you basically are just pausing your game and progress. I wish it was more consistant with carrying some of the weight of clicking like most idle games.', ""Bagus Bangettttt!!!! I have only played this game for 20mins but so far no ads pushed into your face. I understand the devs need to make money but forcing ads on people is not the way. Anyway the graphics and gameplay is great. I'm just happy there's no force ads. Terima kasih own-games for making this game. Btw I have visited Bandung where the tea fields are n had the best es teh manis ever. Love from Australia. (EDIT)3 FEB:after new update the touch has been affected and unable to open menus"", ""It's a fun way to pass the time! The only issue is that that all my frappes say that they're in use but.. literally none of them are being used because of this glitch. I can collect and upgrade them fine, but I cannot benefit from them at all. They're also gone from my main shop but I can still see them when I go to the truck or other stands, still saying that they're all in use"", ""The game itself is okay but there is one massive issue. The English version of the game has lines that are sometimes spelt wrong or may not even make sense. There are also some words that aren't even English. Please improve the way that many sentences are appallingly written and take this into account to improve your game!""]"

Thank you for playing!","[""I was enjoying the game but I am officially uninstalling the game because everytime I play it a popup keeps coming up saying the offer is about to expire for this game. I close the popup and it comes back up interrupting me 2 minutes later. Otherwise I'd have given this 4 stars. My other pet peeve is being constantly asked to rate a game before you get a good feel for it. If the game is worth rating I'll proactively do it instead of this constant begging before I've gotten a taste."", ""I've been playing this game for a while, and while it is a good game, I've had a few issues. There's been times where I can't click on anything, the daily tasks, the rewards wheel, and the biggest issue I've had was, I've tried to purchase things with the gems, like the time boost and it'll say that I purchased it but I never got any coins from the boost. Other than that, it's a good game."", ""I love the game, it's super fun, but the damn ads are frustrating as all hell. Not that there are as, I dont mind watching ads for bonuses and support, but that it can take 1 to 5 minutes to load them, and any with the cancellable counters dont actually count for your bonuses. Its infuriating. If they can fix the ad load times and the counter ad functionality, I'll 5 star this."", ""Honestly, I've played a lot of idle games, and this is one of the top teirs.

Good job guys, keep it up."", 'So far par for the course as far as idle games go, REALLY hand holdy, I get some people might have never played an idle tap game before, I\'m not one of them, I do not need nor want something popping up on screen every 3 seconds FORCING me to do x y or z instead of just letting me enjoy the game. I dig the esthetic for the most part, screen is a tad cluttered with all the ""tap this thing to watch ads or give us money"" icons though.', ""It's been fun. I like that I earn while I'm away, but I do kinda wish that the 8 hour offline time was extended to 12 so that I can earn without hitting the cap when I have to work. I have to account for the time it takes to travel to and from as well as my lunch break."", ""This is the best of the best when it comes to incremental games IMHO. The talent and creativity on display here is top of the line, and it's refreshing to see developers who haven't succumb to greed! They give you every opportunity in the world to earn the things in the shop through free play of the game. To the point where you actually want to throw them some money just to support a developer that isn't trying to line their own pockets. Just a fantastic game, high recommend!"", ""This game is absolutely adorable and so much fun! It's very easy to earn coins and gems, they include mini games that help you earn them. You can buy extra, but it isn't a major necessity to do so because of the mini games 😊 they definitely deserve my five stars 👍👍"", ""This game is awesome! By far the best idle clicker ever, so much features to this game for an idle clicker. The upgrades make me come back everyday! Keep it up, dont give this game a 1 star cuz it wont load or because it not your style, if it wont load dont write meanful things about the game, give it a 3 star and say that it will not load and should fix this issue. And if not ur type dont write anything or give it a 3 star and say it's not ur type but if you like idle games maybe try this one."", ""Fun but problems. I enjoy games like this but something that makes them go a little quicker are the boosts.

Simple and addictive."", 'This is a simple fun game you can kill time with and still enjoy without using real money boosters though the opportunity to do so is still present.

One problem with it is I can't see my coins because they are in the top Center of the screen. If placed on the top left of the screen I will play the game. Take tips from Idle miner on improvements"", ""I love this game!!! No ads at all!!! If you click an ad, the wheel spins until you have to force close the game.

With this idle evolutionary simulation, you can go through all the stages, mixing different creatures: from a single-celled to a posthuman. Don’t miss the opportunity to look at the evolution of the world and have fun. It’s an amazing evolution game!

In fact, in one game you get evolution of cats, dogs, birds and the complete evolution of man. It’s a genetics game about the development of life on Earth.

Worthwhile and fun, this is a game I like to keep open on my desk at work to tap around on periodically. Easy five stars and the best reward system I've encountered."", ""Fun, unique take on idle games, and about as non pay-to-win as you can get since, after all, there are literally no microtransactions.

There truly are no pay to win features, forced ads, or popups. This needs to become the new norm.

All in all, this game has quickly become one of my favorite idle games."", 'Lies about ads, this game uses the standard ads practices most free games it there use, ads pop up as portals every now and then just like every other game, the grind is built where watching ads non stop is the best way to play. Edit: The dev team also will lie in order too hide the fact that ads do in fact pop up in order to harass the player to view them by spawning portals on the screen in order to play the game at a sensible speed otherwise the game hinders you until you do.', 'Fantastic game, ads are non intrusive, and seem as though they actually reward the player. This game truly does impart a fun experience and you can tell the creator put everything they could into it.', 'Very happy with this idle time waster. Especially since it is offline, No Ads, and NO Pay-to-Win! This is a must have for my phone for those boring times with no cell service and nothing to do.', 'Smooth and addicting incremental gameplay, with quite a few long term increments that work past its ascension mechanics.

You don't get that feeling of losing ground to someone else if you're idle for a while. Simple game. Enough progression to avoid boredom. Well done"", ""I really like this game. All ads are optional, but you need to watch a lot of them to progress past the walls. I don't mind though. I recommend getting an auto clicker to play the game overnight for you or it would take way too long to grind."", 'So far its actually pretty good. I havent gotten extremely far but it has a good mechanic system to start over but stronger. Its a little bit of a slow game but its an idle game but also not at the same time', ""This game is true to it's word. No in app purchases at all. Also all the ads are optional and infrequent.

Enjoy empire building! 👑🏰","[""I've been playing for a few days now, and so far it's been a fairly balanced and entertaining idle game. Time spent waiting for points to build and play time is a good balance to keep me coming back multiple times a day. I've downloaded several over the last few days, and this is one of the better ones!"", 'I cant get passed the loading screen, its sad really cause the game looks fun but i dont understand why its kicking me out of it. I could use some help. I would like to give it more stars', ""Very good and well made game, just gets a little bit boring and is just the same thing over. But if you downloaded this game, you wouldn't be wasting your time."", ""I like casual/ idle games in general, but not this one. I've only been playing a few days but I am already bored. I thought there would be more... There are 10 buildings you rebuild and upgrade. The profit rate increases with level (coins), advancements (coins), technology (ads), advisors (ads), and a knowledge multiplyer (game progression). Coins are meaningless with inflation and rebuilds. It takes hours of ad watching to get tech/ advisors. The $$ options have mimimal benefits at <$6."", 'Takes to long to upgrade your items. Besides that this game is awesome.', 'Game is fun and runs smooth. First few lands went by quickly but by the time you get to the 5th set of lands the game starts to turn into a grind. Getting chests for new tech pieces is a bore, watch a 30+ second add to keep getting the same pieces over and over. The cost of advisors quickly becomes insane amounts of gold, that you will almost never get unless you wait weeks or spend money. This is where id say the pay wall comes into play. One star, until the game is balanced and no pay wall.', 'Good game but I wish there was a tutorial It would have made the game so much more understandable.', ""I used to like idle games, but then they all just kinda became boring. This game has changed that though. The fact that it's 3D adds something that most, if not all, others don't have. Keep up the good work!"", ""A good fantasy idle game, build up your kingdom over time. Not much new here that hasn't been done before but still it has good visual design and pleasant sound effects. Polite townsfolk give you billions.exe"", ""It's a pretty good game if you (like me) enjoy games that require minimal effort. I would like to see more changes in the appearance of the structures as upgrades are achieved but overall this game is what you'd expect"", 'the music is probably the most relaxing thing in the game.', 'Seems like alot of other idle building games graphics could be a little better seems to be lacking something im trying to figure that out. The buildings dont really change that much but its ok.', 'Fun time killer game. But takes too long towarda mid game to advance. Ends up being days between advancement.

Unfortunately, as much as i want to give a 5-star rating, it would be a 4, for the one issue i have: Accessing certain features like Challenges, Achievements, etc. I can't even watch an ad to do something, the button is just stuck in a loading animation. Even after an uninstall, the issue remains. Please fix, i would so love to give a 5-star review..."", ""I enjoy this game. And I've emailed u. And not heard a thing. And. The ads on the game just loading and loading. I want. To continue. My progress. Watch an ad. To. Collect. More money and. Diamonds and to get bonuses but. There just loading and loading. Like they are gone. Soo what's going on???"", ""This a fun game and I like playing it, the only issue is the achievements, once you get an achievement you have to watch an ad to receive your reward, this doesn't make sense and just wastes my time to the point where I dont want to collect my achievement rewards, I dont have a problem with the other ads that show up but the ones that block you from collecting something you earned takes it too far."", 'Yes the game was fun, but the fact that ads pop up randomly is pretty annoying. Another thing that annoys me is you have to watch an ad to be able to get a reward from the achievements. Other than that the gameplay is pretty good. The ad I saw of this game on another game inclined me to download this game. This game really surprised me. I expected another bad game. I hope this game will improve in the future.', ""No point downloading, i downloaded this app 2 days ago, reached level 100+ but none of my rewards were working in addition the collection rewards where bugged too. I've tried re-installing this game 5 times to try and resolve this issue but to my suprise this has fixed nothing attempting this method compleatly wiped my progress although my play account was active Furthermore the in game event refused to load. This app is a waste of time and i hope the dev can fix these issues until then its 1/5☆"", ""It's fun, but it doesnt last. Once you have all first floor build lines, it's a drag. As you near the endgame progression only happens or upgrading machines only happens after challenges. The output of your factory doesnt even come close to what's needed. The garage isnt available which is a huge disappointment. Feels half finished, and the ad removal option is a total waste."", ""Ads. Ads. Ads. Game doesn't let you play anything without ads. Even paid for the no ads upgrade but didn't work at all. Every 30 seconds you play, you get an ad for something. What's the point in this being a game. It's literally advert simulator. Imagine thinking that was a good idea. The game is fun but you don't actually get to play any of it so why have you spent the time developing a game with depth if you're just going to fill it with ads."", ""This game is fun and is actually fair. You get a decent amount of the paid currency just for watching ads. However, I've only rated the game 3 stars because of two major problems. One is achievements; you have to watch an ad to get your achievement reward. That's dirty and causes me to not even claim rewards. The second problem is unskippable ads. An employee will pop up and say they found something for you. There's no X to close the window so you're forced to watch an ad. Please fix these."", ""The game is great! I love how you start off small but then get a lot of money if you play enough. One think I do think you need to change is you have to watch a video to claim your reward. It's agrivating because I worked hard to complete it and now I have to watch a 20 sec video so so I can get the reward I earned.......But other than that 10/10 would recommend."", ""First of all the concept is good. But the UX design is the worst I've ever seen in any app. Popping up screens where they aren't supposed to or ads in your face. If you don't mind clicking on ads I'd suggest you play this game otherwise let it be in the play store because it's really annoying."", ""Too many ads and at an insane rate for even a free game. Need to watch an ad to claim an achievement. Plus all the flying ads and ads that can't be skipped. It's fun but all the ads take the fun out of the game. I wouldn't mind watching ads to fund the game but being forced to watch more than 3+ ads a minute is way overkill"", 'The game is ok (not great but enjoyable) but there is an absolute OVERLOAD of ads, which derail the whole experience. If you play it to your best ability and take advantage of every offer, reward, and upgrade, all of which have ads attached to them, you spend LITERALLY 80% or more of your time watching ads. Not worth your time.', ""Ad watching game. Lots of involuntary ads and clickbait icons that move in front of where you're tapping to get you to click another ad. Ads for moving forward. Ads for coming back to the game to get a 2x multiplier. Ads to unlock items. It's really the best ad watching game ever if you just love ads. If you don't like ads, this game is not for you."", ""Too many ads. There's more than enough ads with standard play for bonuses and such but they also randomly pop up. 1 star because most gameplay requires ads however they suddenly stopped loading a week ago. Reinstalling did nothing but wipe my cloud-saved progress."", ""It's a fun little game, but the amount of ads pushed at you is frankly absurd. At any time you can have 5 things on the screen begging you to watch an ad. Occasionally some character will pop up on screen demanding you watch an ad and there's no way to turn them down. I get it, it's a free game and you gotta make money somehow. But this is overkill. Frankly too exhausting to even play."", 'It is a good fun game but I have 2 problems. 1. The frones for adds fly through the screen and it is impossible to tap and avoid adds. 2. You need to watch ads to collect achievements, that completely throws out the idea that achievements are rewards. Its just like an ad that gives you gems. Other than that, the game is simple but fun.', ""Yeah, was enjoying the app. I understand free apps get their money from ads, so I do willingly click on about 1/5 or 1/4. But apparently that's not enough for this app, and they force ads every 1 minute, even after I just finished watching an ad I clicked on."", ""Great game!Would recommend but I rated it 4 because of the unskipable ads and the ads to get the achievements.Its ok for people to show up with an ad but let us at least have an x to press.If you fix these problems i'll give you 5 stars but untill then,its 4 stars."", 'I played it for an hour, they might as well call it factory advertisement galore. You cant play it for more than 2 minutes without out stop-gap watch ads, there is even an ""achievement"" that rewards you for watching ads, and in order to claim it, you have to watch... guess what an ad. I\'ve monetizing games before but holy smokes, this is taking it to a whole new level', ""I see people complaining about all the ads, but the game literally won't let me see ads. Even to earn rewards. I'm struggling to continue because I literally can't even collect my achievements....."", 'Everyone is always so quick to complain about ad based games on their phones, while ads can seem overwhelming on this game heres what ive noticed makes them different from others. Most ads are click based only, meaning you can easily avoid them by just not clicking them, on the off chance you do click accidently, most are able to be skipped by just not getting the reward. Secondly, the ads they do force you to watch are skippable after around 10 seconds and still reward the player. 5/5 imo', ""This game is pretty fun but there is way to many ads. You have to watch ads just to unlock your achievements. Sometimes I'm forced to watch one because a pop up comes out of no where and I accidentaly tap it. The game is fun but they need to lower the amount of ads they put in the game."", ""This game is great and all, but...WHY ALL THE UNAVOIDABLE ADS?! I understand you need a way to earn money, but seriously?! I HAVE TO WATCH ADS JUST TO COLLECT MY QUEST REWARDS!!!!!! WAY too many, and some of them don't even give you anything! I would like this game more if there weren't anywhere NEAR as many ads, but until then, DO NOT download this game."", ""The game overall is good, easy to go to next level. Unfortunately it's got a technical problem on Factory 7 it doesn't work, have had 3 days on it trying to see if it it could upgrade and nothing, just now on 4th day it is not working control, graphic I was really enjoying this game, too bad have to uninstall."", 'This game is great right now im on the tools part and i just had to get 30 shelfs and 50 maces but it was very easy because my hammer does like a couple hundred hits and i just got this phone too because i really like this game and i hope you get it because its a very good game and i think you would love it to. but for now i hope you like my message thing and i will see you on different rates and i will love it if you fead my messages so BYEE!!!', ""Like the game but having some trouble. Can't collect any of my achievement rewards or do the challenges, or even try to use a boost, all the buttons have permanent loading circles on them."", ""Some sort of glitch going on, won't let me watch videos.

Except I can't even load adds even when I am connected to wifi."", ""Horrible. The game is good I like it but it's like you're forcing us to watch ads. Optional Ads for stuff that's cool. But to get an achievement? Come on guys. Im going to use ads for money drops and production boosts can you at least let me get my own achievements for free?"", ""Ads just ads constant ads. Everything consists of ads not how high up you are in the game just the amount of ads you watch.There are also ads you forced to watch no matter how many attempts I've tried to stop it. I get the struggle of making a living from a game but it completely ruins the experience"", 'Its fun though sometimes when i watch an add to get a reward it says that it didnt work and makes me watch another. Also it has something where it forces you to watch an add. No x to get out of it. All you can do is relog. It would be more fun if i wasnt forced to watch adds.', 'Game is ok but there are just too many forced ads.

Not to mention some of the ads are excessively loud and have no options to mute, i usually play out and about i use my headphones and listen to music, i played this for about 10-20 min, i liked it, THE ADS!!!!"", 'Interesting but when you start the intro to the game is too long and i wish therr was not that much ads!! Im so mad therr is like 7 ads in a row!!! And the ads have too much clickbait or it justs makes me go to play store!!!!!!!!!!

The next big update is scheduled for March.","['This review is written by a geologist. I really enjoy the game. Graphics are fancy, it\'s motivating and - one important thing nowadays - there is no AD spam. There are ads but nothing that costs 50% of the time you\'re running the game. I installed it around a week ago and unlocked everything that\'s possible to unlock until today - without spending any money. Some more content would be nice and I would be happy to spend money on the game. Right now - due to the fact I unlocked everything within days - I don\'t see any features I\'d like to pay for. Because they wouldn\'t change anything since everything is completed. More content and something like ""pay X$ to get more idle money or faster robots"" would be sweet. There is one thing I do not like - gaining money is just effective if you keep the game running. There\'s no real idle gain (if I didn\'t miss anything). The robots do a good job. But seriously, it\'s a waste of energy to keep your phone running for the robots to do their job. So I\'d either want some decent idle gain or any tap actions to get money. Right now it\'s just wasting energy. Edit three weeks later: still no new content or any news. Some reviews mentioned ""no new content"" months ago so it seems the game doesn\'t get any new content. Downrated to 3 stars. Fun for two weeks, then dead it seems.', ""This is an amazing game with aspects of idle, clicking, and building games. It's satisfying gameplay makes it addicting and desirable to complete every dinosaur and fossil. This game, like most free games, has ad breaks. However, these ads are NOT as frequent as many others and are generally quick. When running out of moves for excavation you can earn a generous amount of extra moves by watching short ads (which is very helpful if you lack coin to upgrade your moves or pickaxe). Great game!"", 'As of this review, max gold is capped to 2 million. I fell in love with this game 3 days ago, and just unlocked my final dinosaur today. Completing digs is fun in its own way because I can tap as I like on the dig area and stuff happens heh. Everything can be done for free so far, nice. My suggestions are: - If possible, I request the unlock conditions button to be permanent, or added to the dino log - In the dino log I also request tabs for Small, M and L dinos Looking forward to the update!', ""I absolutely love fun science games and this game's one my joys. The game's cute and challenging at times. The graphics are good too - it's super satisfying to see the complete skeleton all shiny and displayed! However, it's pretty easy to get all the dinos and updates are slow. I gave it 4 stars for this reason. Maybe if they could add an achievement system players could punch in a few more hours plus receive special trophies that they could even display alongside their dinos! Overall nc gem 😁"", 'Love the game, very addicting and always stuff to do. Progression is great, and paced well. The one missing star is that the game does not explain anything. It does not explain how to use the items or how changing your displays can affect your income. I understand there is a language barrier, though.', ""***I've gotten 3 Styracosauruses in different map locations.. not sure if Im supposed to have 3 of the same dig or if the game glitched and now I'm going to miss out on other skeletons.. **They updated the game since I reviewed and its great! More to do and little coin collecting bots 😎 * I did everything I can do so far. Great Game! I understand why, but can you put in an auto collector for coins? Maybe managed per room? Update soon! I want more to do!"", ""PROS: -Ads give bonuses and in no way does it feel forced and it doesn't feel grindy without them. I think it's a perfect balance -you can move your fossils around. I think this was a great touch and makes me feel like I'm crafting my own museum -the looks are cute, I like the details in each dino piece CONS: -When you finish a fossil you get an extra % completion and I'm still unsure of if it just means I have a little extra of certain dinos, or if some dinos give more $ than others"", ""Really great game! Good balance of leveling as you level up. This game never gets too easy with powerups, so it offers a consistent challenge. Fantastic design of the dinosaurs. Cute graphics. A lot of details you don't notice at first like the sun as you dig. I also like that there's no timer on different activities. You just play when you can for however long or short you want! Overall, this is my favorite phone game. Can't wait for the update!"", ""It's a great game, very addictive. But there are a few things that I think would make the game a little better. One, you should add missions and do challanges to gain more coins. It is very difficult to gain coins if you need a lot quickly. Also, you should add offline earnings. So players can get more coins to unlock more stuff. Last, but not least, an ad that will get you coins. You can click on the coin bar and there would be an option to watch an ad and gain just a small bit of coins. Thx."", ""Really like the 8bit graphics of the game, it has an easy pick up and play feel with intuitive navigation. It would be good if you could include information on the dinosaurs so you could learn something while playing. Also need the update as I've already found all the dinosaurs and upgraded everything."", 'Update considerations - open the dinosaur menu by tapping a pedestal, not by a button on the bottom. Place the dig cost above the dig button in the pedestal menu instead of having a separate confirmation popup with the cost. Also remove the large text overlay time at the start of the dig where you can still dig anyway. These changes speed up gameplay. Making it more clear what 2 damage vs 5 damage means would also help immensely instead of being vague numbers next to red/blue hexes.', ""I never leave a review, but this game has been such a joy that I have to leave a good note. It's relaxing, rewarding, and isn't aggressive on ads. It's not a game based on skill but still leaves me feeling proud of my little museum and the progress I've made. Definitely recommend it c:"", ""As someone who has loved paleontology and Earth Science since the first Jurassic Park, even going for a Geology degree right now 😜, I absolutely ADORE this game! Might seem repetitive to some, but going on digs it's just that! You are never going to find the complete fossil the first go round. Keep up the awesome work and I can't wait to see what y'all have in store for the future! Maybe a National Park version!"", ""It's a fun little game. I love collecting the pieces and trying to guess that what animal is coming up being a bit of paleo-nerd, even if some of them are a bit off from their real counterparts. My one issue that is taking away from full stara is the fact there is no way to display every fossil we've found. And id love to decorate my museum more and maybe some sort of select and swap."", ""I downloaded it thinking it would be a clicker game and although it wasn't what I expected, I was pleasantly surprised to find a simple but super fun game. There are many dinosaur skeletons to find and completing them is very satisfying. I can't wait for the next update. Something I'd like to see at some point in the future would be an extra room to build the dinosaurs, like turning the storage into a physical place, just to see them once there's no more room in the rest of the building."", ""I removed a star before features I paid for by buying the starter pack were removed in a later update. (Item wheel without advertisement) When I bought the starter pack, the item wheel was proposed as ad free at a regular time without ads thanks to the starter pack, which isn't offered anymore. It's a shame, because it's a relatively fun game otherwise."", ""This game is absolutely one of my favorite apps in a while. It's incredibly adorable, addicting, satisfying, exciting, and beautiful. When grinding needs to be done, its not tedious or frustrating. Each dinosaur dug up is like a new little adventure. Always wanting to be a paleontologist this game is just heart-warming. Looking forward to future updates and will definitely be donating. (°∀°)b"", ""So far so good! It's an easy-going game that doesn't force you into watching ads or making microtransactions. I'm just rating 4 stars because it's not something that has got me enthusiastic about it, but in general it's suiting nicely the genre and I'll keep playing"", ""Surprisingly enjoyable game, although that might be because I love dinosaurs. Dig up dino skeletons bit by bit, display them in your museum (or sell them) to generate money to pay for more digs. sounds simple, but the fun graphics, balanced gameplay, and chill atmosphere adds up to an enjoyable experience. Care was clearly taken in the art and in balancing everything (rarely do I feel cheated while digging, and gathering coins after a dig typically brings me enough money for the next dig). But there are a few things that could improve this game: -More information on the dinosaurs (maybe in the book of dinos, and then it would be nice to tap the dino in the museum to go to its page) -Bonuses for a themed room (all pterosaurs, all triassic, all armoured, just carnivors, etc) - possibly room generates more money faster -Bonus for guessing a dino's name before completing it"", ""This was a fun experience for me. Can't wait for more fossils to be added but for now I need to take a break from it as I've completed the game. Update: I official love this developer. I just got all 38 Dinos and Marine life. Can't wait for the next update."", ""One of the few games I needed to complete at 100%: all upgrades, expansions, and dinosaurs. Currently working on max coin so I'm ready for the next update. Took only 4 days to complete. Never felt burnout. Overall a great game."", 'Unique art style, simple fun guessing game, less than intuitive UI at first, but once you click a few buttons it becomes clear. Just started so unsure of any PTW mechanics and how fair they may or may not be. Seems to be a charming time killer. Will update later.', 'Meh... Was genuinely enjoying the game but started to notice there are no offline rewards, so it forces you to constantly be online... Then the only real way to get money is via bus, which takes FOREVER to leave even at 2 rooms... It was a cute thought, but sadly the gameplay leaves so much to be desired.', ""This is more fun than it has any right being and the ad experience isn't that bad. Occasional, mandatory full screen ads that are fully skipable. If you think it might be your kind of game go ahead and check it out."", ""I have a question about the secret bones that goes inside red boxes. (how to get them and which dinosaurs has them), I found up to a 60% and completed all available dinosaurs but no red chest doesn't appear. I've searched and there is no information or videos about it plz help. Nice game by the way developers ;)"", ""It could be repetitive but a good way to pass the time while waiting for the train etc. Simple gameplay that is surprisingly entertaining. The app also let's you choose to see ads or not for extra turns, visitors etc. Good job."", ""I love this game and I don't care about the ads. Yes there are a lot, but you can play the game completely FREE and play for hours, at least until you finish everything they have so far. This game deserves more love than it gets."", ""It's simple and easy to get the hang of. Once the game gets going it becomes more fun. Running your museum is interesting. A challenge system could add extra playability. Fun game worth the download."", ""Super fun little game to play when you just have a few minutes to spare. Collecting every dino and organizing your museum are some of my favorite things to do. Can't wait for the update so I get more space and more dinos!"", ""Great game! Super cute art style and tons of fun. I hope you add more fossils in the future! It'd also be cool if there was a fact about each fossil you can unlock once you finish the skeleton."", ""The game only plays when I restart my phone. I have the OnePlus 7T. That's a bit frustrating but when it does work I thoroughly enjoy playing. It's a great game to just sit and relax."", 'Game play is fun, digging up the fossils is very injoyable. Would play tell I have found all the dinos, but lacks ample spacing to display them all. Would love more fossils to dig up and more spacing to display all of them.', ""Very addictive, time flys by. I've been playing for 2 hours and not once has it asked me for money. Lots of ads though but I prefer that then it asking me to open my wallet."", 'Great game concept, dig up to get part of fossils and manage your museum. Does not have irritating ads that interrupt you. However getting the same part of a dinausor once in awhile is frustrating. 10/10', ""The art is very endearing and the UI is very easy to understand. It's a great, simple game to pass the time and relax. It's even helped me learn more about dinosaurs and paleontology!"", 'Great pixel game. But there are some adds that are random but can be exited. One of the main things is that nothing happens if you go off the game and return.', 'I really enjoy the feeling you get when you finish a dinosaur! Thank you for the update love the game, keep up the good work! I was hoping for more space to display dinosuars in last update on feb 7th, but i know you are working on it.', 'As a child I always dreamt of being an archeologist. But as I grew in age that dream drifted away into nothingness. Earlier today I discovered TAP! DIG! MY MUSEUM! and, with my interest piqued, I proceeded to download said app. I have dedicated 30 minutes so far into this masterpiece and I am thoroughly pleased. I can now relive my dream of being an archeologist with this wonderful game and I am grateful.', ""So far it's pretty fun. Only got to my 2nd display, but the gameplay is simple. It's also luck based enough to where it's not just a instant reward."", 'After all the AAA games who leave you with the cold shivers and jittery for more, TAP!

Pretty fun and takes a lot of patience, but the fact that there is basically no tutorial is inconvenient. What do the colors of different properties mean? Also, only 2 coins per ad? Cant buy anything after a while.', 'Very simple but fun and entertaining, I am a real big fan of the upgrades and feel the real life location purchase feature makes the game a lot more interesting.', ""I really like the interface and politics of the game, but there's one problem I have.

Really nice concept. But after lastest update there is problem in exiting the game. Please look into this. Sometimes, after buying certain percentage of property, that property becomes invisible, you cant find them while searching.

DTT is really good game that I've experienced.

Enjoy!!!","[""I am just unsure of what the purchase for remove ads function does. I paid for it because I thought it would make the game play a bit less time consuming with all the ad options that come up (especially with reset function and what not). I mean the description did mention that the optional ad rewards will still be available but I didn't know that paying for that function would change almost nothing. I kind of feel a bit ripped off to be honest."", ""Multiple aspects of the game seem to be broken half the time it doesn't seem like you're actually getting your money when the buckets drop the mushrooms and if you actually pull the chain to make it go faster (which is a huge component) you almost get no money. The display that shows your money is broken too as it shows your money as being in the thousands when its in the millions."", ""I find the game to be a nice time killer, yet there is a issue. Theres a playable add for a idle mining game, or something along such lines, that makes the game freeze after being played. Personally it's the most common add being used and after every time when the add is done playing I cant do anything. The animations of the game keep going for the cauldron but the mushrooms stop growing and the claws stop moving. I have to delete the tab then re open it to keep playing. Something to look into."", 'The game has cute art and aesthetically everything is pleasing. Until we get to ads. The game can hardly be played without getting an ad every fifteen seconds. Even when ""given the option"" to bot see the add, the game still shovs it in yiur face. I understand these apps need to get revenue when you are not willing to pay for the full version, but tbe amount of ads on this game is just plain ridiculous.', ""Dont pay to remove the ads that they force you to watch to play the base game, as it wk t actually do anything, and dont worry, there's no option to contact support for your problem. They probably figure that people who are dumb enough to pay them to get rid of forced ads shoved down your throat, are probably too lazy to find a way to get a refund. Dont bother with this game unless you want to watch ads every few minutes to play the base game, with no real option to remove them."", ""Like a lot of other reviews, I have to complain about the repetitive gameplay, and exhausting ads. Also...I think I beat the game? I've stopped getting new mushrooms... Ironically, the last mushroom is for creativity. There's a lot potential here; it's a beautiful game, the mushrooms are fun and adorable. But it's lacking extra elements, I'd love to cross pollinate to earn new mushrooms, or set up extra breweries for separate cures."", 'Okay, I love the concept of the game and the varied ""clicker"" mechanics, but pop up ads completely ruin the game for me. And you know whenever you level up you can choose to watch an ad for more money? Well I didn\'t feel like watching an ad so I chose less money. AND I GOT AN AD ANYWAY. Make a good game and I will happily pay for a no ad option. But when I hear you still get hounded to watch ads I knew I was done.', 'If I\'m paying to remove ads, why am I still being forced to watch ads to reset my mushroom farms to the next rank? It said ""optional reward"" resetting to rank up shouldn\'t be considered an optional reward. Aside from that, I appreciate the simple but fluid looking animations, varying design of the mushrooms and color palette and the stop on potion production when the cauldron is at Max capacity. It\'s a decent simple little game, albeit the quantity of ads is a bit much. Still deleting this app.', 'Try another idle. Unless you love watching advertisements. Very rare I would leave such a low review yet combination of factors here couldn\'t ignore -Every game action/click, (with exception of minor levels) punishes you with an ads...yay? -When one has purchased the ""ad free"" package, still punish with ads... um? -Last but NOT least, no support/contact in game (must be getting strife about non ""ad-free"" game play?) Excluding that Balanced. Graphics nice. Good game- if you can actually play it', ""This is a really cute and fun game! The art is really cool and the different kinds of mushrooms are awesome. My only problem with it is that when I open the app not connected to wifi, or good wifi, it doesn't load multiple things such as the different bucket designs, how much money I have, the level up bar, how much I earn when I watch an ad. A couple of these problems go away once I connect to good wifi, but it still doesn't show how much money I have, and how close I am to leveling up."", 'I feel ads though the no ads option is a scan, I understand that it says remove forced ads, but how are the reset add not forced ads, if you want to progress you have to watch ads. I paid to remove all forced ads thinking that it would remove that specific ad wall. But rather it removes nothing, there are no forced ads to begin with. There are pleny of optional ads to give you temporary boosts or instant rewards. By all means download the app, but DO NOT pay to remove ads it is a scam.', ""Pretty cool, except when I've collected all the mushrooms and leveled them to max, there's really nothing do. Maybe add different sets of mushrooms to by with coins when you hit certain levels. Like themed sets, seasonal, etc. Or a special set when you hit level 200 to keep people playing. Feels like it needs to be expanded."", 'Extreme Ad Game I really liked this at first, but you spend 75% of you game time viewing ads. The bonus for double speed only lasts a few minutes, and the bonus for double revenue at most is 20 minutes after watching 2 ads. Gamers gotta sleep, and it would be nice if you could build your time up by 2 or 4 hours. Deleting.', ""The game is very cute and has a lot of potential, but there isn't much to do and it gets boring and repetitive very fast. Maybe you should have a lab where you can mix certain mushrooms to create potions or maybe you should add some minigame for finding new mushrooms, like exploring a forest or something. Anyway, I hope you add more things to do."", ""Game acts like I didn't pay. I paid the $2.99 so I could have a nice can night since the game itself is cute. It crashed a few minutes after the payment finished and I found that not only was my progress not saved, but the game was still asking for payment. In addition, during the short time the payment was recognised I found that nearly all ads stay in the game. Only the one that pops up every couple minutes (might) be gone."", 'This game was really fun initially but it ""broke"" after a couple hours. It no longer shows how much money I have or registers the mushrooms that go up the chain. Sure, I can buy all the upgrades without actually paying for them, which sounds great but it sucks. Because I also cant see how much I\'m leveling up and usually can\'t level up at all so I\'m stuck at the Hat mushrooms. I wish it didnt break because I really liked it.', 'This game is great, other than the fact that it seems the game is nothing but a way to force people to view ads and the the dev profits heavily. If u want to prestige, gotta watch an ad. Which this happens every minute or so. Want to get the next mushroom 2 levels early? Watch 2 ads. Wanna speed up production? Watch an ad. Every mobile game these days is full of ads, but this is the first game that is so blatantly obvious with their forced advertisements. You should be able to progress freely.', 'It calls itself a idle game but its more or less just a ad watcher since you can go from the start to the very end in one stretch and only thing taking time is watching the forced ads. If it got changed into a actual game and actually have some difficulty and content added in it might be worthwhile but for what it is now unless you wanna spend your time just watching ads dont bother.', 'Intrusive ads that play even when you select the option to AVOID the ad pop-up. Super lazy and a lil too whimsical for what I was expecting... such as real psychadelic mushroom strains to be the progression, not ""jellyfish mushrooms"" and ""bee mushrooms."" Like what the duck guys, you picked the coolest name for the worst possible ""game.""', ""Meh. Too many ads. I finished the game in about a week, but in order to finish it, I watched 260+ ads (because you have to watch an ad everytime you want to restart a mushroom do that it earns more). Plus it randomly shows ads when you're leveling up. Its an okay game that I only stuck with to complete it."", 'It is true that for levelling up you are forced to watch an ad, there are also bonuses like 2x monney and a speed boost for ads. Sadly this game is only playable till lvl 145 since after that you get no more new shrooms thus no progress. You can however watch an ad to upgrade your profit for 1 specific kind of shroom, resetting this one species amd giving you more monney, you can do this 9 times before reaching max, which doesnt help you since there is no more ti accomplish.', 'Aesthetics: on point. Gameplay: satisfying. Ads: UNBELIEVABLY IRRITATING!!! They are everywhere, and they are unavoidable. You can pay $3 to ""remove ads"", but it only removes some of them! I really want to enjoy this game, but the ads RUIN the experience. I do not recommend.', ""i enjoyed the game for the first few hours but sometime after stop plating the game completely stopped functioning like it was suppoesd to, it doesn't show my money so i can buy anything in the game the game is basically hacked after you play it for longer than a few hours, was honestly fun but got boring because of this bug, please fix"", ""This game is cute and simple - with creative mushrooms! However, it gets boring and repetitive. You have to watch dozens of ads to reset your growth for a specific mushroom, and I've maxed out all mushrooms in about two days, and there's no way to continue. There's just not a lot to do."", 'Gameplay is a fun clicker, but you better like ads. If there were an option to purchase no ads, not just no forced ones, i would rate 4 or 5. For 3 level ups it gave me the option to take the level up, or watch an ad for more resources. I took the level only to be greeted with forced ads anyway. Terrible ad design decision. Not to mention the other ads for rewards options track right over where you would click.', '$5 to remove 10% of the ads? I enjoy the game and the mushrooms are very cute, but seriously? The most used ad feature in the game is to reset the farms. This is a necessary step of progression in the game, thus what I would consider a ""forced ad"", however after purchasing the ""remove ads"", they are still there. The only ads blocked are on the level-up if you choose not to watch one. These occur every second level or so generally. Not worth the $5 just to remove rare ads. Please fix, TYIA.', 'Ads-free isnt ads-free. It says it removes forced ads not all ads, but when i have to stop playing your game because an ad popped up in my way i consider that a forced ad. If it changed anything then i dont see it which means they failed to provide the service offered in exchange for payment. Otherwise i enjoy the game.', 'Awful idle game. In idle games, you\'re supposed to reset and get better at whatever it is your making or doing, that\'s normal. Magic Mushrooms has this ability too, but they force you to watch an ad to get a reset. Since this game is designed to let you reset different mushroom shelves constantly, this game is mostly ads. Buying the ""remove ads"" package still forces you to watch these. Awful money grab. Just stay away.', 'Too many ADs. Level up hit the non AD option still get an AD. Want to reset? Need to watch an AD. Clicking on mushrooms better be watching carefully or the falling mushroom will get you on another AD. Not to mention the random ADs it pop ups up whenever it feels like it. I was hoping to enjoy this game as I just completed achievements on another idle game and was looking for one to play.', ""DONT PAY FOR NO ADS. I was really enjoying the game but got tired if ads everytime a reset a mushroom, so I decided to pay the $3 to get rid of forced ads so I could enjoy the game and not get interrupted by a 30 second ad every few minutes. Turns out that didn't include resetting even though its necessary to the game. Very frustrated and I feel ripped off. Very deceptive."", 'Pretty enjoyable so far although the progression of the mushrooms seems a little weird since the second one i got cures death but everything else gets me more money. Also i paid for the no ads thinking it would let me reset levels without dealing with ads since resetting some part of the game is almost always a core aspect of idle games but still had to deal with ads to reset which i find weird cause honestly i never had any pop up and force me to watch them so kinda wasted my money.', 'Nice concept but lacking in mechanics and variety. My biggest issue is that when you level up and press the ""I don\'t want to watch the ad and I\'m happy with half the bonus"" button it mostly just plays an ad anyway which you can\'t skip. This is really annoying and I just close the app at some point. I probably won\'t be playing this anymore unless the aggressive ad system is toned down.', ""It's an amazing game, which has some ads. If i pay 4.80 for a no ads option I expect NO ADS. The main reason I bought no ads is so I can reset a mushroom without having to watch an ad. But no. Every single time I do it 45 seconds of ads goes past. I would pay 10 bucks more for real no ads."", 'It\'s a fun little clicker with appealing graphics, but dear developers: people tend to have more patience with ads they can choose not to watch. As is, the high volume of ""mandatory"" ads kinda ruin the experience. I would have rated the game higher if not for this problem.', 'This game has a good concept but very quickly becomes quite boring. There are no options to research new potions or to improve quality of produce. In short there is nothing to shoot for besides waiting patiently for the next level up in order to buy the next mushroom layer. Then initial premise is good but it needs a lot more work added into it. Also consider a shipping option and price setting etc.', ""I paid to remove Ads, and yet the game is still filled with them. They mentioned that opt-in Ads would still be around for bonuses, BUT the little mushroom that floats down, and attempts to make you accidentally click on it still appears. AND you are still forced to watch an Ad to Reset the level of you Mushrooms. That is seriously scummy. What Ads did I pay 2.99 to remove? Cause I seriously can't tell. Only giving 2 Stars cause I like the artstyle."", 'Not bad but completely filled with ads, watched 7 ads in 5 minutes because you get one per level. And even got to watch some more ads as the ""bonus"" golden mushroom drops down in the way of tapping if you aren\'t careful. Progression is entirely tied to ads, even resetting one of your mushroom stages requires and ad.', ""Charming graphics, but this is one of the least interesting and engaging clicker games I have ever played. I actually like games where the object is to just get the biggest number ever, but this one doesn't give any real sense of progression. Every tier is the same as the last."", 'Don\'t pay to get rid of forced ads, you still have forced ads. Apparently resetting mushrooms for better yield isn\'t a forced ad. I guess it\'s technically an option, despite that mechanic being core to idle clickers. I see others have mentioned this, wish I\'d read the low star reviews thoroughly. I\'m not sure if the ads on the level up ""less"" option are gone but it\'s a waste of 2.99 that hasn\'t improved my experience. It\'s cute to look at though, I\'ll give them 2 stars for that. Low bar.', ""As someone who has played this game to the finish i can say the game is alot of fun but i'd love to see more mushrooms later on in development and maybe a prestige mode to give us more to work towards because once i got the max level for the last mushroom there was nothing more to do but level up your character and the cauldron. Please consider this for a future update i am very happy with the game and am looking forward to more. :)""]"

- Bug Fixes","[""I really love playing this game. I have played one like this before. I extra love the events. I would love to rate 5, but for the last 3 events, the only 3 I have participated in, I did not receive my rewards from advancing locations. And the only reward I get when I come back after the event is the pie that is at the top of the reward list. This last event I cleared 7 locations and didn't get any of the good stuff."", ""I like the concept and it starts out fun, but it really needs an overhaul and some rebalancing. Unlike other idle games that become more fun as you go and rack up bonuses and multipliers, this game becomes less fun because each level requires so much more to stay idle. So you either have to stay in the game manually tapping nonstop to keep your businesses running, or just leave the game while it tries to notify you that you haven't automated it yet. Very frustrating for this type of game."", ""I live in a metal trailer and don't always have a connection on the cell phone and have to sign out to charge the phone. It needs some off line features for those who could not automate their businesses before having to recharge the cell phones.2-21-20 too many updates. I was asked to update yesterday as well. Why are there so many updates?"", ""Love this game.. When it starts, which it hasn't all afternoon. I love this game that much that I've I uninstalled and reinstalled it a lot of times because it won't load in the hope it would work perfectly on the next install, something I've never done for any other game, usually once a game is gone, it's gone. Been trying all afternoon to get on it but it's not happening. Plz plz plz fix this then I'll give 5 stars"", ""Fun game. I like that it will keep earning game coins while I'm earning real-life coins. Can be painful to level up a manager before hiring, unless you are willing to spend real-life coin to buy gold bars. I'm not willing, so I'll see how far I get before irritation outweighs amusement, and I move on to other games."", ""Don't play the events. My screen froze while loading the 3rd level so after a few minutes I closed down and relaunched the game and it sent me back 7 missions then gave me totally new ones that are not doable. I have to spend 1 million horse shoes which I can only get 72 at a time while hand clicking them. I have to upgrade a manager but no cards. Last option, I need to aquire cards. Don't play events. They're not fun"", ""I would give 5 stars but the ads are glitchy so missing bonuses. Ads seem to be working better and enjoy the events but would love to give some feedback on events such as: Quests come out of order (you can't collect cards when it's the last objective etc) It's impossible to get enough cards to have managers after the third level or so."", ""I'm rerating this 1 star because, you have not improved the game, instead, u have taken it 10 steps back with the last update. If it's not broke, don't fix it. You put out an update in the middle of an event and literally screwed me and many other customers. The game and event now freezes while ATTEMPTING to play, the double income boost ads freeze, and half the time do not pay out the double income boost, the ads to watch for beans do the same thing then the game completely freezes for a time"", ""It's fun but very buggy. They want you to watch ads to get bonuses and such which is fine, except every time you watch an ad, your shop progress resets and you lose all the resources you had stockpiled there. This also happens any time you turn off the screen or switch to another app."", 'The money squeeze: At the beginning of a reset, you can have building automation taken away, and if you don\'t have enough ""pie"" to upgrade and get it back, you have to pay $$$ for more pie. Especially nasty if you lose automation of your barge, as then you can\'t collect profits idly any longer - effectively turning the game into a clicker. That last bit is why I quit and wrote this review.', 'The item pull in events used to be one pull is 500 of the event item for it. Now it goes up after every pull. I am NOT a fan of this. Makes it impossible to get all 100, lv up workshops, and get event trophies for events unless you want to spend $10 a day on even troves that can not be used next event or for main game!', ""It's really a fun little game. It's perfect if you're sitting and waiting for something for someone. If you do have a problem or question and you send them an email. You will get a robo response but within a day you will get a human response that will answer your question explain the problem or tell you they're fixing the bug. You don't find that on a lot of games and that's kind of important to me. And if they have a bug they fix it quick!"", ""It was good to start with, but the ads for the pie, double income and eagle don't work any more. Also the tasks are impossible. The latest earn cash quest has been running for over a week, I'm less than 1% of the way to completion. It's just no fun anymore."", 'this game is great. but I did get a glitch that only started me out with 1 coin and you need 5 to build the first building so I literally cant do anything. the fact that I cannot play this game is why a gave it a 2* Edit: I got help from support and now i can play fine again 4*', 'FUN game, however the ""managers"" that are supposed to keep things moving behind the scenes are worse than real life. Lazy! MOST times, from watching adds to logging off the game is working at a fraction of the speed unless you are present and watching! Bye Fallecia!', ""After the newest update mine has completely crashed. It keeps saying that the game needs to re-up date but now it keeps crashing. It worked fine yesterday after doing the update but now it's not working at all"", ""Feels like some slight tuning issues because my progress has slowed to a crawl. It's kinda discouraging and I will probably quit soon b/c my real life sucks too much. I play for escapism, not challenge. I do like the themes of the special events though."", 'Really good game. I like how you can idle and make money. My only complaint is the event character cards for your event manager are too hard to come by sometimes.', 'The last update was supposed to work out the bugs, but now whenever you watch a video for the 2x boost it creates bugs like never before and I have to close the game and reopen to sort the bugs out', 'I love this game!!! It is fun and I get lost in it so many times and forget about what I should be doing. I really like the events and wish they were more frequent, except that is how I get lost also LOL!', ""Fix the bugs for higher rating Eagle flying over head can't view videos for extra coins, watch a video for extra videos can't do and 2x the coin can't view videos either was working ok before today I uninstalled the game and reinstalled it very disappointed atm"", ""I find this game addictive. It's easy to balance. You can choose to spend a lot or a little time on it and still progress well. The events are quite short though and it's difficult to get a decent score."", ""I have just downloaded the game and it tells me to update. I haven't even been able to start. No very happy so far. I uninstalled and reinstalled and it still tells me I need to update to the newest version. I was really looking forward to playing this now I'm just upset."", 'I have been playing this game for months and still love it. Maybe more gold or using coins to buy cards would be nice. But fun and still playing.', 'Cute graphics however you need to watch a lot of ads to further your progress or make in-game purchases; at least the ads are working again!', ""Not too bad. The ads bit kinda froze up and you have to restart to get the bonuses, but other that that it's a typical idle game."", 'I love this game. My biggest thing is on special events you dont always get to have the managers. My hand gets tired clicking.', 'The special events become untenable. There is an imbalance between levels and the required units to upgrade the characters. Levels are typically set 3 or more above what is acheivable.', 'Love the game have been playing it fir ages. But the new stages are just so hard to pass that I now onky okay when there is an event on.', ""Love this game but feel I may have to delete it soon as it takes up far too much memory. Up to 6.5Gb and I've had the game less than a year. Any plans on addressing this? Would love to keep playing."", ""I'd rate it a 5 but I'm not spending $20 every week to try and compete in the event. If you're not lucky you don't get the needed cards... you can spend money though. You also can't upgrade everything unless you spend money. The event also isn't really idle... if you can't upgrade you have to sit and tap every 2 seconds. Another issue is the goals... some of them are impossible or they aren't in a logical order. I love the game but there are a lot of things that need to be fixed."", 'I would give it 5 stars, however the Ad part to double your income has stopped working and some of the task in events to achieve are ridiculously hard to complete. I like the random cards from completing missions and opening chests, but that too makes the game very hard to get anywhere with because it will never give you what you need and it puts you so far behind on some characters, it gets frustrating after a while. Apart from that, this game is not too bad...', 'Love the concept. But it drops out quite alot. Will continue to play this very addictive game', 'It was a fun game to begin with. However, once you get to higher levels it almost turns impossible without buying. Be prepared, because once you hit higher levels it could take weeks even months to complete. It definitely turns into a hard pay to play game. I have gotten to the point where I wont even open it for a few weeks because it gives me the money I need at such a slow rate to expand. The events are worthless unless your willing to spend hours of continuous play.', 'My favorite idle game so far. I\'ve played the basics: from Adventure capitalist to weed inc, and a bunch in between. This game, I\'ve managed to stick with. The extra worlds are a bit too much for me. This is one world with an event mode once a week or so. It\'s perfect for me and I love it. Sucks when the events are over, but I love the new ""tier"" system they have. I thought it was a temporary holiday thing, but it seems to be sticking around :)', ""Game is nice looking and not a bad game. It isn't as idle as it says it is though. Every new stage you have to level your managers up to hire them, and it is unlikely that you will have the cards to do it until you finish the stage, then in the next stage you have to upgrade them again immediately. Without the manager being hired, the things aren't automatic and you will spend a lot of time clicking. Ending up having to be on it all day doing so."", ""This is a game could be great. However it's unbalanced & becomes unplayable without buying premiem items. That might be okay, sometimes I'll pay to play but in this game your IRL cash doesn't get you far. The events are unplayable & aggravating. You will never get the cards you need so you'd have to buy them. It's one giant cash grab. However, there are no forced ads unless you want some extras. But if you're looking for a fun game to pass the time, pass on this one."", ""Edit: Have been waiting for over 2 months for the problem to be sorted. STILL not sorted. Loved the game but I have had to uninstall the app because it won't load, then it will load but crashes when I try to connect to my account, then it will not load again. It has been like that for nearly two months. So I have given up. Have tried on 3 or 4 different devices but still have the same problems checked internet all okay."", ""Fun game, however you have to use gold to really succeed and it's not cheap."", 'I loved the game until the last update. I feel like event rewards are going to be much less unless you spend some big money. The minimum level for main and events can be annoying. I was able to get a legend crate for events and now gonna be a rare crate and common outfit. After the last update it does seem to be a just a big cash grab.']"

And boring for waiting the money unless you pay or click the ads everytime. The good one is you can open this game once a week only to see the money growth, check for a few minutes and open again next week to see the progress.', ""Literally a waste of time. Bought the remove ad feature because I though this would be a game I would continue to play but literally was done everything in an hour or so. Challenges end really early, you can unlock all the area pretty easily, and that's it unless you want to sit there and collect gems for no reason. This is a bust."", ""Good, but LOTS of ads. Also, I would like to see more end game content, I've been playing for a few hours and I'm already seeing the end as I've upgraded most of my shop as much as I could. Some kind of multiplayer (ranking) would be great, and maybe deepens the army system, would be great to recruit soldiers of different strengths and send them do different quest, and maybe raid other players, would make the gameplay more dynamic I think."", ""I can see the influence of codigames clear as day and that's good because their idle games are really well done. However some gripes. It's a bit to easy to get to the last castle the game. With nothing more to strive for. It says I can upgrade further but it doesn't let you. A few of my goals won't let me accept them even as I have completed them."", ""Did I Finish Too Soon? I started playing a few days ago, and now there are no more quests, no more stores to unlock, no more territories to buy... What is this? There's really no more? There are lots of spaces on the map where stuff could go. Really glad I didn't spend any money on this game. It's fun, but it's over too soon."", 'The game is beautiful; however, its dazzling graphics cannot recompense for the fact that the game is too short and inconclusive, especially considering all of the expensive offers and advanced upgrades the game has. There are many games in the market that are just as visually impressive as this game and with much more content in terms of quality. I give the game the benefit of the doubt that it will continue to update regularly, but it should do so with more quality.', 'If you like using adds to progress this is the game for you. Five ads within 2 minutes just to reach level 15. Waste of time. For those who like games that are worth, this is not one', 'Rather basic with not a lot to advance into.

It would be nice if you had more goals, and more gifts to send to neighbors.

Also, as an android user the content I receive for decor and other items are completely different and as a long time user I would like to know why. Lastly, those mystery boxes/chest are a total rip off. There is only one item and like most of the decor for the game over priced. Would like a response. Thank you.', 'Please have Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas, Valentines Day, etc. versions and more variety please. It has gotten very stale. The same decor, the same themes, the same clothes...

I don't have much money so the game requires careful strategic buying, upgrading buildings and population. The developer gives money at times, but can only give so much, so good use and patience is required.

I'm glad I found the origin of the stollen footage. Your game is so good others steal its gameplay for ads."", 'I love this game - played both 1and 2. I would like to see same type of game with different story line - like plane crash survivers on a mountain having to survive off the land while waiting for rescue or something with castles with a lost prince or something. Guess I just want more - I have not been able to find any other game like this one - where I can play with very little to no limits. Thanks', ""Wow, without paying, I got to a second island. You have to spare most diamonds and only spend them when it's necessary. A rough way... Great story kept me playing for 2 months."", 'Game is good so far. Characters need to be closer together during tasks.', 'As a game the idea is great and becomes addictive. However while i was playing at some point the game clashed and i had to uninstall and reinstall it, however i have to start from the beginning. It would be nice if it could be avtually saved and even after the delete to continue at the level you used to be', ""I've played a lot of these type of games and although there is a lot of running around the game is fun to play. A walk option would be useful, but still a game worth coming back to, constructing different things to aid survival is easily done. The character interaction is good. Worth the down load."", ""It glitches sometimes but it's a very fun game! Edit* I have gotten to the second island but I'm not able to get the tung oil (although some people claim they're able to, I'm one that cannot). Please update this game as soon as possible.

I love it, 5 stars! Great time passer, although it is a bit like an idle game.', 'the game is good but for real, it will take weeks or even a month to progress, gathering 100k tech points for single aspect of the game, puts the entire gameplay on idle or even stagnant which makes your players just bored about it but if you want to progress quickly buy some tech points from them. Please take it into consideration that alot of the players will go bored on a slow pace game. the graphics can be improve. controls are okay.', ""Super fun!

I love that there's an objective and it reminds a lot of the Sims!"", ""It has intrusive ads, full screen and enough to be pretty annoying that go on for ages. it is detrimental to the game as this is the type you check up on quick.

Only complaint is that there is nothing to do after you finish the game."", 'Very nice I enjoyed a lot ... add more puzzles and update programmes like hospital .. high school...and 2 3 neighbouring tribes ...travelling facilities to there...', 'I love this game. I like how you can pause it, half, normal or double speed time. Works fine on Note 3. I have 32 villagers and most have red or copper hair due to selective breeding.

This version is way better then the original #2. The graphics are awesome.', 'Screen is too small. Majority of screen is occupied by menu and stats. I loved the PC version but android version is kind of disappointing.', 'I enjoyed the game because it brought back my childhood memories. however, the enjoyment only lasted ONE DAY. there were a lot of ads that suddenly pop up when I am in the middle of doing something in the game. i know this is a free app but the ads should not interrupt the game like every 5-10 mins. plus, there is no way to close them. got to uninstall this game.']"

I feel the developers really dropped the ball and made this extremely to hard to complete. For one, It should not take 60 energy to try and catch a cherub. All the tasks were way to hard plus you guys took away the free daily energy and videos. On top of that there were too many Golden boxes to open. No one can complete all the tasks and open boxes, and collect boxes."", 'Game lag is f....ng awful...I had this game on a Samsung tab and the higher levels made response time slow...I figured it was my tablet getting old so I put it on my Samsung phone and the same happened ....too much money invested in game to quit..but slowly getting away from purchases...have same type of game but not playkot on my 12inch kindle and !!!!!!!!!!!!.', 'Love the game,but here lately it crashes andor will freeze and will not respond.

Very addictive and challenging. Like many games there are frustrating aspects to it...for example having to acquire a high number of articles that take a long time to come up. Also, having to acquire the same items over and over and over again.

Do you want to find a new time management game where you can play for free? Then this game is for you! It's not the usual cafe where only food is prepared. 

When was the last time you were in an amusement park? Or fired at ships in Battleship, danced until you dropped, hit a high striker competing with friends, or took photo booth pictures instead of selfies? 

Here's where the ever busy Sophie thought that returning to childhood dreams, if only for a day, would not hurt anyone. She left the office where her boss was a petty tyrant and together with friends opened her own amusement park ""Funmania"". 

Sophie is still a budding manager, so help her succeed! Here is her plan:

- constant purchase of new arcade machines for the arcade: 
you will learn to improve them and do without them during their repair;
- quality customer service in the form of time management: hand out fan cards, help players with games, make time to attend the register because no one comes and plays for free, and look after the line; 
- fun mini games: arcade machines (Battleship, Claw Crane, and many others), a small kitchen (ice cream, drinks, cake, etc.)

Thanks to your help Sophie will find time for her friends and fans and other games for girls. 

You will see how drastically her life has changed since she opened her own arcade. You will be told all about that in colorful comics, live SMS chats and also in the stories with hidden hints that are before each level. 

If you get through levels like an expert, you will be able to develop your own island that will gradually turn into a little paradise right before your eyes and also get a pleasant surprise at the end!

You can play the customer service and develop the island for free, but there is also an opportunity to speed up the process. 

Game features:

- 100 intricate levels and customer service in the genre of time management;
- 10 unique arcades and the secret keys to their success;
- various mini games: arcade machines, a photo booth, a kitchen, a food court (ice cream, cake, etc.); 
- an intriguing plot: business, romance, and secrets of friendship;
- colorful comics and chats with memorable characters;
- an opportunity to develop your own island.

Compete with friends, share your success story with them, and invite them to play the game for girls for free!

Make your childhood dreams a reality!

Ive never spent money on this game and I would love too. There is a huge amount of outfits and things I'd buy except the price points are way too high. 15$ for an outfit that's like fortnite prices.

Only thing that I would change is that you can't trade or sell things for your house which I have more than one or just want to sell also things to buy in shops costing gems instead of hearts or money.

I usually get bored within a couple months with games, but this one I've had going on 6 months and love it just as much as the first month!

Owning a farm and all the usual activities that come with it is fun. The game has multiple ways for players to interact and talk, its very cute. I was a little worried about safety with open chat and interaction but I allowed my little sister to play with me. Parental Controls are offered however, just needs to be configured. I played for a long time but life catches up with you and it got a bit repetitive, so I took a break for a while.', 'Love this game, really fun and addicting but I do feel like I could share some recommendations.purchasing clothing and beauty options in the shops are very heavily limited on the diamonds or the hearts which are quite hard to obtain in the fastest time. Also with the extra clothing and furniture there could be put up a trade system similar to the market but instead of purchasing the item with gold you would exchange it with an item that you already have.', ""This game should not be as engaging as it is. The progression is lightning fast & the competition is fierce. This is the only farming simulator that gives you reasons to come back every 30 minutes, & WANT to come back & do things. Other players are friendly, & can really lend a hard on your crops. Truly on a class of it's own in the farm sim game space, 3 thumbs up."", 'Well...I do like it and play but it boots me off constantly, the ""lucky wheel"" should take all products off of it and for some reason theres no way to really earn willow tickets which is infuriating!

P.s make where i can trade furniture cause im never buying those ridiculous priced things.', ""5 stars. Lots to keep you occupied while waiting for machines. Totally addictive. im level 55 and have played so much in the last few months ive passed a few friend's who started their towns before me lol. Can i add a couple of suggestions though. Please remove basic ingredients from boat and dragon orders, like flour and butter etc. We need those base ingredients to make other items. And a different storage for building materials, expansion materials and flowers/tiles, separate to food and crop"", ""I have fun playing this game but the storage concept annoys me bad, why do I get full with only a few items and the materials for upgrading never come although I've sent the dragon many times. Instead of counting each and every item individually why not count them as sets with 10 as set limit, eg: even though I have 10 pizzas it'll still be counted as 1 but if I have 11 it'll be counted as 2 in the storage. Please consider. Needs some touches here and there too, feels like its lacking something."", 'Love the game so much . There is alot of argueing in global but other then that great game good graphics', 'If you are a fan of Story Of Seasons (Harvest Moon) or Animal Crossing you will most likely love this game.

A great game to play with friends or family, or on your own!', ""A free to play simulation game that is fun and enjoyable! As expected there's a timer on just about everything. But there is so much to do that you don't have to worry about running out of content while you wait for a building to construct.

Valve in Valve Mitral app provides information specific for a clinical scenario, quickly and simply. This will help in the planning of and performing a mitral Valve in Valve or Valve in Ring case. The application navigates the user through important aspects of surgical mitral valves, mitral rings and TAVI valve design, which are vital for a successful Valve in Valve or ring procedure. The app logically steps through the possible combinations to give the user specific information needed to perform the procedure. 

Success of a Valve in Valve or ring procedure is based on correct identification of the surgical valve or Ring, choosing the correct size of the TAVI valve and its subsequent accurate placement. Surgical valves and rings vary in appearance under fluoroscopy and also in their internal diameter. Similarly TAVI valves differ in their appearances and available sizes. 

Knowledge about all the surgical valves and rings that have been implanted in the last two decades is minimal but relevant to the Valve in Valve or ring therapy. Users can now familiarize themselves with important design information about surgical valves, rings and TAVI valves; they can also select the valve and find out which size of TAVI valve could be used and how it is best placed during a Valve in Valve or ring procedure. 

It also gives information about differences between TAVI valve sizing for mitral and aortic valve in valve procedure. Mitral ring properties, which will have a big implication when considering a valve in ring procedure are also discussed. It alerts the user about potential problems especially when considering valve in ring in certain designs. 

The Valve In Valve Mitral app can be used to plan a case and confirm suitability for this procedure and reduces the need to trawl through vast amounts of literature to find information specific to the clinical scenario. The information is also available without the need for an internet connection and will enhance the users understanding of various aspects of this procedure. We hope this will result in improved results and better outcomes for patients. 

At the heart of the idea is education that is free to use. It is hoped that the App will encourage users to contribute tips, tricks and feedback so that we can continue to develop the app. 

Full list of features 

- Design information for multiple types of surgical valves. 
- Sizing information for multiple types of surgical valves. 
- Real life and fluoroscopic images of all the surgical valves. 
- Design information for multiple types of surgical rings. 
- Sizing information for multiple types of surgical rings. 
- Real life and fluoroscopic images of all the surgical rings. 
- Design information about TAVI valve designs. 
- Sizing information for these TAVI valves. 
- Guides the user through a stepped process to help choose a specific valve or ring, then the size and lastly the important dimensions to plan a Valve in Valve or ring procedure. 
- Image based guidance for the ideal placement of a TAVI valve. 
- Video examples of actual placement of a TAVI valve. 
- Discusses important design considerations in detail to improve understanding of the Valve in Valve procedure. 

Quick, clear and concise information about heart valves and rings and Valve in Valve therapy. A guide you wish you always had at your fingertips. 

The App is not a substitute for clinical judgement or institutional policies, thus it should complement and not replace normal procedures for making clinical decisions.

Protect your rent bond, or home, against future disputes with the Rent Protector...

The Rent Protector is professional help for landlords, agents and tenants which saves time, money and potential disputes by recording condition reports that everyone can agree to. 

With professional, pre-loaded, editable questions helping you report on conditions, anyone can complete their own home inspection.  The Rent Protector  allows comments and photos to be added to your inspection for an indisputable future record.   Your final inspection is generated into a professional PDF document which can be sent to all parties.  

Buy once, and pay nothing extra no matter how many inspections you make.

Many tenants and landlords may not realise the value of doing a home inspection before a new rental lease is activated.  For a tenant, the Rent Protector can ensure they receive their bond back at the end of the tenancy by allowing the tenant to return the home in the state they received it.  For a landlord, it can give piece of mind and save future disputes by recording the condition of the property and providing the information to the tenant in order to agree the condition.

The Rent Protector enables the landlord/agent/tenant to do their own condition report record of the property rather than leaving it in the hands of the other party or an agent.

Highlight features: -

*  Professional questions aimed at uncovering issues
*  Question help text to provide extra clarification and insight
*  Ability to edit the back end settings and questions
*  Inventory capture
*  Easy to use interface
*  Works off-line
*  Immediately saves input
*  Can capture multiple photos and detailed comments against areas or inventory
*  Detailed PDF document generation, including summary and signature pages, as well as linkage to photo indexes
*  Links to Google Maps for easy address lookup
*  Customisable PDF output, including splash graphics and headers
*  Ability to clone/copy existing reviews

Don’t rely on someone else to be on your side when it comes to protecting your bond or your property. Inspect your home yourself like a professional and share your
documented inspection until its time to hand back the keys.

The graphics are also pretty nice. 👍🏿"", ""So far I'm loving this game...assuming the idea is to get people to keep farming making various recipies as they wait on other productions to finnish....then cut down on the wait times for ingredients such as milk eggs etc. I absolutely love the map and ability to go about without using the already scarce energy. Also not everyone can coin so make the price of extra slots cheeper and dimonds more eaisly attainable. A few adjustments here and I'll be playing this game for many many years."", 'Quite a nice game,however the constant need to keep switching areas is very frustrating and off-putting...and like most of these type of game,you cant get anywhere without spending...no facility to chat...you can change the clothes and features on your avatar but at ridiculous costs(gems)....disappointing so uninstalling...', 'Good game but having to travel to different places food goods is a bit of a pain it gets annoying after a bit', 'Cute, easy, and fun!

I was on level 14 and now the app just loads to 90÷ and wont do anything!!! I reinstalled and lost all my progress and still is doing the same dang thing. Please fix!!!!!!!"", ""This game could of been a great game if you didnt have to use energy, which theres no way to have enough unless you want to pay for some or wait 8 hours to get enough to play and then it takes so much of it that you only get an hour of play time so let's wait 8 hours to play for an hour so stupid of the designer, atleast make it easier to get energy or I'm uninstalling, like i said this could of been a great game if it wasn't for needing energy to play, I will play another game"", 'Lovely graphic and music, love it that there is no storage limit.

It's pretty intuitive and the notifications work. It's helped me not over water my plants. I did pay 1.99 to get rid of the ads - worth every penny. I want to get the pro version but it's a bit pricey so I haven't yet. But honestly, I've tried all of the other water reminder apps, and this is by far the best one.

I can put in a load of info about my plants and keep journals on them. It also allows you to put in photos so you can see how they grow I guess.

It's a shame you have to pay to get the full stuff, but people gotta earn money - so five stars! :)"", ""Good! Does not seem to want to save custom pictures. Please add total plant counts or number of plants (total and per label). Hasn't been updated in a while so hopefully it hasn't been abandoned."", 'Loving the app so far! Very simple and intuitive to use. My only critique is the ability to have different time frame choices for the reminders ( weeks, months, years, etc ). It becomes tedious and a bit annoying when I have to adjust by days for every 2 years on repoting for example. Also, I may want to adjust a reminder instead of removing it and adding a new one. Would give 4.5 if I could. Definitely changing to 5 stars if these features are addressed.', 'Excellent app for reminding me to rotate and water my succulents. Very nice clean design and the ads are not intrusive. I love the ability to add custom photos and names for my plants and to add journal entries as needed.

Right now, the app does what it promises and it has potential to become even better over time!', ""Great concept of an app and exactly what I was looking for as a houseplant lover but there are no push notifications, so I don't know which of my plants need attention until I open the app. I'm very bad at remembering so this would be a useful fix for me!

- Added information about every shop and house in the town
- Optimized the start page","[""There are a lot of great features in this app, but a few things missing to really make it 5 star. Small stuff like inconsistent alphabetized lists and repeated events in the wrong year are a nuisance, but other apps have features that I'd like to see here. Such as summarizing most profitable crops and if you can't get them until a certain year or event, as well as the ability to make notes/to do's repeatable. What I'd like to see added the most is event descriptions with times, locations, etc."", ""I absolutely love the UI. But there's strangely some information missing or inconsistent. My ideal use case of this app is to search an item and immediately see which NPCs will like/love. In the app, this works for some items/NPCs but not all. Will keep installed though as this app has not been abandoned."", 'Everything is superb, couple of items missing, would be 5 stats if it had a night mode pls add night mode', 'Great app! The clean menu system and UI is the reason I bought this guide, job well done. I would like to see what food people dislike and maybe a marriage tab added to characters describing what they bring to a marriage. Keep up the good work and thank you!', 'Seems great for the most part. I love the crop calendar. I do wish that it took fertilizer into consideration, though. Otherwise, it looks nice, feels nice, and is incredibly useful to make your life in Stardew a bit easier.', ""Great app that is still being expanded. However, as of the recent update it seems I can no longer filter the lists of fish, recipes so I can only see the items I dont have. Now it forces me to hunt through the entire list to see which I have and dont have. I'm not sure if this is a glitch but I miss that feature and wish it'd come back."", ""It's ok. It has its uses tracking crops etc but the amount of times I still have to head to Google instead is pretty bad for a paid for app. If it was free OR it was a more complete package, I'd recommend it, but as it is, I don't."", 'Great app especially to track your bundles for the community centre, would be great if the heart events for each villager was on there so we knew how and where to trigger them without having to search online.', 'Amazing app. One change I would make is to add the rewards you get for the bundles so users can prioritize without using another app or having to Google it.', 'Amazing, but I will ask for crafting recipes.

One question: can we set someone as our spouse so we can locate them accurately, etc.?', ""So I've been searching for the best planning/tracking app to be my companion guide for my newest playthrough of Stardew, and believe me when I say I went through a few apps trying to find the perfect one. Guys, this IS that app. I've been using it for several weeks now, and I only find myself retreating to the wikia for building requirements and miscellaneous item info. This extensive app and its devoted developer are an absolute gem! I eagerly await updates, keep up the incredible work :D"", ""It's a nice app with a sleek design, but some of the information is simply outdated or missing. Can't recommend spending money on it in the current state."", 'Hi again! :) How about a change in font setting like for example in the crops section, in the title head like spring crops, if that were to be bold, that would make the distiction of the seasonal crops more easier as well as to the fish section, animal section, etc. Thanks again!', ""Lots of information on most things. I love the calendar aspect that lets you know when certain things are happening, which if you are playing for the first time would not know where or even if they existed. I would give a full 5 stars if I had access to what items the villagers, not only loved/best gifts, but if I knew what they liked/neutral/disliked/hated, if I can't give them the best gift. I've seen this aspect in some other free apps and it's really the only thing I'm missing from this one."", ""Great app and resource. Could definitely do with more updates, first I'd recommend a general app-wide search function. Keep up the great work, glad to have purchased! 👍"", ""This is exactly what I needed! It covers all the basic stuff like community bundles and gifting. But most importantly it lets you set date, time, whether the community center is done, and the weather to to help you find the NPC of your choice. No more scanning the wiki because you forgot Sebastian's birthday and for once he's not in his room."", 'Pretty good app, would be 5 stars if it had what the villagers liked not just loved. Also a gem tracker since you can track artifacts. Last thing, if it had villager tracker for rainy days. Unfortunately still find myself going to the wiki too frequently to make this purchase worth it. Edit: Having read other reviews and dev responses, I realized this is a brand new app, in which case, it is very well done. I look forward to updates! Keep up the good work!', 'i love the guide so far, very helpful. i\'ve run into an issue with the ""NPC locator"" causing the app to constantly crash whenever i tap on the option. A feature i would love to see in the future is an option to track artisan goods put in either casks or kegs and preserve jars to the calander for those of us who keep forgetting when and forget to check (myself included). also could you please add the ""Wild Seed"" packs to the crop planted section of the calander? thanks and keep up the great work', 'Nice app. Easy and convenient. Missing some components that I would really like to see implemented. I love to forage and would like to see it in the app. Edit: My 3☆ review is based on the current status of the app. Given how old the game is, that the app costs money and that it is missing vital information, my rating feels justified. I reserve the right to change it once more features and information are added.', 'Thanks this is really helpful you did one amazing Job! Also i wanted the know do this app work when i have my wife offline? If not please make available q', 'Very detailed guide, and is the only one I have found that can tell you the uses of an item so you can quickly tell if its needed in a bundle, recipe, or gift for a friend. Almost earned 5 stars accept some items are not yet implemented (as in they dont have the uses menu) and it could really use a filter on the menus to shortcut to Summer / Fall / Forageabe / Lake / Ocean etc', 'Love this app but would love it more if it had all the buildings and that for your farm and what you needed for them to make it.', ""This is actually amazing. It includes everything I've been looking for. The developer was swift with a response to correct an issue I was having. P.S. The Music player is actually the best and I can't wait to see further updates and more implemented into this app!!"", ""One of the best underrated trackers/guides you can get on the playstore!

Great interface and flexible options. Would have given it 5 stars if not for the fact there is no way to back up or sync the app's data. So if you lose your phone or have to reset it, you will have to redo every single plant entry again. Also, the ads can be obtrusive. I wish there were a paid option to get rid of the ads. I hope the developers work on a version that lets you back up the data. UPDATE: Developer added import/export of data so changed rating to 5. Great job! Thanks."", ""I don't really understand what's the point of this app if it doesnt and can't send you notification on when to water your plants. It just becomes an app to keep track of all your plants.

It would be nice if there was a premium mode to get rid of the adds, I'll gladly paid for it."", 'Seems like a nice app, but turned the nice idea of logging into plain ""comments"" in the plant details. Also shows random ads every now and then. Otherwise, nice icons, basic grouping, good reminder settings...', 'Very functional, easy to use app that has literally been a life saver for my plants! Love the addition of winter mode, and feeding and misting schedules', ""I like the design and functions but absolutely don't understand the layout. Where can I water plants individually or when do I have to give them water?"", 'I absolutely love this app and rely on it for my many houseplants but recently the widgets increased from a 1x1 size to 2x2 and they take up easy too much room on my home pages.

Excellent app. Thank you for creating it, dev(s).', ""Great for keeping track of all the plants and their watering and fertilizing needs. Use it only as a guide though like a reminder to check on your plants, sometimes they won't need to be watered yet. They also have a winter mode which works great. What I would like in addition is a data backup option."", ""THIS IS A GREAT APP!!!! The only thing I don't love is that you get an ad every single time you add a plant to your list. If you have a lot if plants it's extremely frustrating! However, format is great, I love that I can add pics of my plants, take notes, and set watering and misting alarms. Great app but really difficult with the ads."", ""Day one I loved this app! So cute, tons of helpful features as a new Plant Daddy and that's about it. Since then all it's done is crash.

You have to open the app for it to notify you, I'd rather have the notification when I turn my phone on."", ""The app is decent in that I get reminders and can set it for winter settings. A huge set back for me though is that it can't be backed up. I just got a new phone and lost all my plant info and watering history and I have quite a few plants!

It has been very helpful to me the last few months on watering my plants and knowing when i watered them last. I dont always water but know to check them. I would like to know if i can back them up somehow. I have 104 plants currently logged and would hate to lose all that info.', ""Can't open the app - Samsung Galaxy S10"", ""Hi, as an (albeit amateur) app developer myself I appreciate how well thought out this is in terms of UI. I've only used this for one watering cycle, and its notified me correctly. So the app works perfectly for what it is designed to do. That being said, while I understand the need for ads as this is a free product, there are just a little too many. Every time I move between my plants or add a new plant there is an add. My only suggestion on this front is to tone them down just a little bit :) otherwise, a very good app. Nice job."", ""Thanks to this, I finally managed to keep all my plants alive!! Perfect for looking after my plants and adjusting watering schedules so I don't over- or under- water any. Ads are bareable"", ""Decent app. Great for sending remembers with some plants. With a little section for quick notes. However, I had to uninstall it when I switched to new phone, because there is no way to transfer data/backup. And I don't feel like rewriting my plants and care again. Also, would have liked some watering history or graph, so that I can correct/adjust the watering."", ""I used to love this app, but lately it has started to glitch. It's started to tell me that I need to water my plants a lot earlier than they need to be. I didn't notice at first and was overwatering my plants a lot until it started saying that a plant that only needs water about twice a week needed to be watered every day. Now I'm noticing it a lot more. I really hope they fix the bugs because I really like this app and don't want to have to download another one."", ""Few things.. 1. I'd like that I could arrange the list as boxes. 2. When I mark a plant as waterd the page refreshes and goes up and it's annoying when you have a long list. 3. I wish there was a watering history cause most plant don't need water at the same period every time and it'll be nice to track after the history of the watering. (Average time and etc.) 4. It shows me plants in red/yellow as I need to water them even though I don't by the day count. 5. BACKUP DETA!! I switched phones and that was a real pain in the... to copy the deta my self... 6. Just a suggestion.. to have a growing diary on each plant with pictures we can add. And notes. (: Overall a great app and very useful but needs adjustments for it to be 100%"", 'I love it but you should add rotating and watering a group together. I got my outside plants on color red and inside on blue. It would be nice to water all red plants when I hose them down but that minor', 'i honestly like this app quite a bit, i would, however, like if i clicked on the note icon in the main screen it could bring up the plant info with the notes already open, and it would be great if there was a like ""wait two days, the plant isn\'t ready"" type of button, maybe the user could set the number of days to delay the watering on a per plant basis. just some small things that would make the app much more smooth. other than that this app does exactly what is asked. def recommend', 'Great so far, would like a pro version to remove ads. Maybe additionally to that a pro version could have more widget sizes/options, that kind of thing.', 'Pretty good app... I had to research how often to set the watering reminder myself as there is no care guide. So far its helped me remember. A big downside is all the pop up ads. I would consider paying for a ""full"" version without ads if available depending on price and additional features ie. plant identification, care recommendations that includes suggested watering schedule.']"
Gardenize - Garden Planner and Plant Journal,com.htec.gardenize,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.htec.gardenize&hl=en&gl=us,"Every garden and gardener is special, but we all have something in common - we have a great memory, we just need some help to keep it up to date. 
That is why we created the Garden app Gardenize - a tool to simplify gardening work.

With a Gardenize account, you can access your garden from different devices and platforms.

As gardeners we have different knowledge, ambitions and interests and our gardens have different soil, size and weather conditions. Gardenize works for every combination of these. Name your plants as you wish and add your own photos and notes as precise as you want to. Use the correct scientific names or simply call a plant ""my favourite red flower"". Gardenize has room for everyone.

We have organized Gardenize in 5 major blocks. The first three we call MY GARDEN. 

My Plants
When using Gardenize, you build your own unlimited garden library, plant by plant, flower by flower. For each plant, you add your own photos and notes and link it to one or many of your garden areas.

My Areas
Organize your garden in an unlimited number of garden areas. Flowerbeds, borders, raised beds or alleys. You name them as you wish, and in each area see all the plants you have in that area. Draw on the photos, with our built-in drawing tool.

My events
Keep notes of all your gardening activities and events by using the garden diary. Create your own ""activity types"" and link plants and areas to each event. Add photos and notes, and follow the development of your crops from seed to harvest, and through all seasons. Set reminders so you never forget to water, fertilize or trim your plants again.

The last two parts we give you for fun and inspiration.

Garden friends
Connect with your garden friends and look into their gardens and invite others to look into yours. Share your plant information with each other. You can also search for public parks and gardens and look into them. This is also a perfect tool if you open your garden for events like ""Open Gardens 2018""

Garden Inspiration
Make a habit of looking into the feed of gardening inspiration, and get the garden answers you are looking for. We publish links to blogs, YouTube and podcasts, all on the topics of plants and gardening. You can search on topics and save posts you like, so you easily find them again. Are you an influencer and want to share your posts in Gardenize? Don't hesitate to get in touch with us!

Other features
-Draw on photos to mark where you plant your bulbs or to mark what weed to rake. 
-If you like to get visitors, add your address and webpage to the profile, and mark your garden location on the map. 
-Search and filter to easily find when you seeded your carrots and get a list of all your tomatoes.
-Share single photos to social media, download to a shared drive or locally on your device. 
-Works both online and offline! Great feature if you have a poor internet connection in your garden.
-Switch devices. Gardenize works on multiple platforms and devices.
-Plant database (Swedish only). We cooperate with companies who support us with plant information. You find link and logo to the plant info providers in the database. 

Paid feature: Export and download
All your photo you get them in a zip file, with name and date. 
All your data in a spreadsheet. 
All your garden information in a pdf. You get a nice handout to garden visitors who don't use smartphones. 
You pay for 10, 20 or 30 exports. And each export can include all your photos as a zip, all your data in a spreadsheet or all your garden info in a pdf.

I see the point if you want to sync across devices, but you can ask for that later. I saw that the subscription is at least 3.90 EUR and I'm not sure I want to pay that much. And the trial is only seven days (not a long time in a plant's life). And then, if I understand things correctly, you have to pay again every time you download your data?? So, although this does look interesting, commercialization seems to be too much of a priority."", ""Tough to have to leave a 1star review but feels like it's the only way to get developers attention. I had great hopes for this app to be able to tell me the needs of my plants (for some reason all apps give you only complicated reminders but you have to research plant by plant what to actually be reminded about). To my chagrin, Gardenize's database feature, my main reason for trying it out, doesn't work at all. No results regardless of what you search for. Have tried reaching out but no luck.."", 'Brilliant garden planner. Can add custom plants. Edit plot photos to draw in where your bulbs and seeds are. Loving it, thank you! Only suggestion would be to be able to filter plant list by seeding and harvest dates or have a way of wishlisting a plant to an area and getting a notification of when to seed. Thanks!', 'I dont like that when you sign into google with your app you want to access all my contacts and their information such as name, phone, email, address etc.??? Signed into google on your app for a whole 5 mins then uninstalled your app cause my google security alert came up. Woke up the next day to my inbox full of spam!', ""Nice app for some planning and social networking. However, it's poor on common plant app features, such as water / fertilizer reminders, or plant diaries."", 'It would be perfect if there was a diary option for each plant and/or area to keep notes in instead of this event setup. I like to track fertilizer use and ph levels among other things.', 'This is the digital equivalent of my old style plant notebook, but infinitely better. I can add screenshot notes regarding particular requirements for each plant and progressive photos showing growth. Love this app.', 'First I liked this app, put all info for my garden/plants/activity. But after 2 months use, app doesn\'t show photos properly, only cropped thumbnails. I guessed, I have used up free storage, and tried to find out premium prices. On their website, monthly price is shown, but no monthly option on app\'s ""go premium"", just ""10/20/30 exports"", no clear explanation about ""exports"". I don\'t want to pay any money for such an untrustful app. Very disappointed. Moving onto Instagram for gardening diary', ""Here's what it's missing; there needs to be a section for planning your annual garden, preferably with lists of companion plants. Maybe even a place to set alerts such as a change in your watering schedule or when to to pick up supplies before your seed order arrives. As it stands the app is just a fancy list of what you're growing so you can show it off, not so much a tool for the less self obsessed. It would be more helpful if you could list your plants and then lay them out into a grid."", ""great app. just a few things for me. need to be able to make an event recurring, don't want to have to type in the same annual jobs each year. would be happy if i could specify a period rather than a specific date but a minor thing. I would also like to be able to tick jobs when they are completed. finally, i want to invite some on to collaborate ie husband and wife, need to share the same data. with those 3 would be 5 stars"", ""I've been using this app for several weeks now, and Im hooked! Day after day I add more and more plant details, reminders, hardiness tags, and general plant details/info copied and pasted in from the web. Love it! Yes, are some improvements that could be made, but I give it 5 stars as I see those as areas for further improvement, rather than negatives. Its not far off being just right, and Im sure offering constructive feedback will get us there. My garden and plants are now available in full colour on my phone (or tablet) Makes a change from boring friends with holiday photos! but mainly its all about the details and reminders. For those who complained about having to log in - its a real bonus to have the same info on both phone & tablet. (and soon laptop) Record updating works seamlessly and im surprised how easily it copes with two active devices."", 'Just what I’ve been looking for, a simple database to catalogue my collection. Just installed on iPad & the first issue I’ve come across is the inability to change view from portrait to landscape. Hopefully, this could be a simple addition. Could I also suggest the option to sort data. Only new to Gardenize but really like what I see. It will be time consuming to enter all my plants & info, but it’s a small price to pay for an app that’s perfect for what I need in pretty much every other way.', ""This is a great basis for the all around care of home gardens. Can be used from seeding to harvesting. A lot of attention to detail was considered for what could be recorded/tracked throughout the gardening lifespan. There are a couple of details I wish were different though. It would be nice to allow for width/lengths for areas, big difference between a 9'x5' bed vs a 15'x3' bed (square footage is same). Also, would be great to have drag/drop for placing plants in the areas.Overall, great app!"", ""Just what I needed, nice simple to use app that helps makes things easier keeping track of my gardening! If I could add one thing it would be a sort of 'plant wishlist' for planning purposes, where I can save a plant type and any researched info i have on it, and maybe compare saved plants with eachother, with filter/sorting functionality? e.g. i could save a load of plants that i fancy and filter for shady/full sun or soil type etc? :) still a 5 star rating from me though, love it!"", ""The app allows a user to record a plant type and variety and an area planted, photographs may be included and other information added. There is no automatic information, for example enter Cabbage, but no cultivation information appears, other than what you may add. Basically this is a simple, flat file database and, being free, that's probably fine. I had an email recently offering me the discounted price of 17_50GBP - for a year. For that price I could additionally access it on a PC. Not fine."", 'Overall a good app. I tried several apps looking for something that will help me track what is planted where. This was by far the best I found. Lots of customization and info options, and I love that I can define my garden areas and look up what is planted by area. It really needs a plant knowledge database/lookup feature, because it is incredibly annoying to have to enter all the info for each plant manually.', ""Ok I changed by review. I understand people do their efforts so I put 4 stars for the idea. I dont want ruin the rates of this good app, just because it's not exactly what I was searching for my own ideas. So thanks!"", ""Another simple app that requires the user to create another account to just to use it. ENOUGH WITH ALL THE USELESS ACCOUNTS ALREADY. Did not get to test the app. Deleted immediately. EDIT TO RESPOND: I don't want mulit-device or multi-platform support. I should be able to add that after the fact instead of being forced to use it from the start. When I'm forced to create an account just to test an app it reeks of my personal data being sold to third parties."", ""I've been looking for something like this. Perfect app to track what plants you have, progress of aging and keeping track of what needs to be done."", ""Don't bother... app doesn't work but they get your permissions for google and Facebook even though you can't sign in."", 'I cant say enough good things about this app. I wanted something to catalogue my plants by area and give me a reminders for watering, feeding, pruning etc. I set these up myself and adapt to suit my garden. The real beauty of this app is it is so flexible, but gives me freedom to input what I want in a truely simple format. I can google plant details if I need more information. So well done, great app', ""Amazing app. Great options to make a plant diary. But i wish you could save your account as is. The export options aren't satisfactory. Integration with Google drive perhaps? Would be great if you were connected to a database of plant names too. That would make it a very useful app!"", ""I just uploaded the app. Please settle these ussues for more *s. FYI I'm using Nokia 6.1/Pie 1. Why does the profile page show a HUGE green leaf COVERING the description of the first option? It's right under LOCATON. 2. Why do you use the tubular font for large bodies of text? As most gardeners are over 50, LEGIBILTY should be the first consideration, and tubular fonts blur. Please go to a senior center and have them test your screens ON PHONES. I will update when I've gotten further."", 'This app has a ton of potential. Very user friendly. The one major feature it is missing is a user populated database of plants. It would be ideal to be able to search for plants (auto populated with recommended care, etc) instead of having to manually add all of the information for each plant.', ""I've used this app for a short time but I already love it. I often get plants from friends and swaps but the markers fade so quickly. This allows me to take multiple photos of a plant so I know where it is! I know they are working on adding a library, but even adding the plants by hand, I love it. I think I'm close to 100!"", ""I like the concept, but I may ditch this app because of its bugginess. It usually takes several tries before a photo from the camera is saved, and sometimes taking a photo results in all my other changes being lost. I'll keep looking for another app."", 'this is a great app however the search function doesnt appear to work. common plants such as aloe vera dont display and i find it highly unlikely that people havent already uploaded these plabt types. also the app really should suggest people to follow etc for you to build and gain ideas as a community It is very good for monitoring and tracking my plants and garden though and is very easy to use and beautifully laid out', 'I really like this app and how much info you can include in it, I wish that the ""garden area"" included a grid plot where you input the area so you could show the actual size of the space and use it to decide how to plant', 'Awesome app! Allows complete categorization of gardens and plants. Only thing I could think of to improve it is integration with a plant lookup tool by photo, or even by name. I would pay for that!', ""Waaaay too much work. Im not manually entering all of the data for every plant i have. This isn't much more than a crappy data entry tool. Needs to leverage existing plant databases or build one of it's own to ease the burden."", 'Too much access required to my personal email for an app to work, deleted immediately.', 'Wonderful. My handwritten ""current status"" notes got unweildly. Gardenize makes it easy to enter notes and find current status and history of specific plants. PLUS photos! I love having progress photos attached to my plants.', 'Asks to see and download my contacts just to sign in with google. What other dishonest nonsense are they up to? Also it doesn\'t have recurring reminders for watering / fertilizing, the whole reason I wanted the app. Download if you want to enter a new ""watering"" event every week.', 'So far so good. it would be cool if they added other yard/garden stuff such as able to track and add journal entries, tracking birds and pollinator such as different butterflies, bees etc. I am stoked to see what else they add.', 'Good app to keep track of the fact/needs about the plants but would be even greater if it came with the function to set recurring event to minimize input. A calendar view or a to-do list to mark things checked.', 'As a professional gardener this app is invaluable I can easily keep up to date with all my clients plants and gardening needs!! I highly recommend! Thank you for creating this marvelous app!!', 'Best garden journal that I have come across. Flexible, attractive, solid, and all entries allow photos. Easy to document all gardening activity.', ""I love this app. There isn't much you CAN'T do with it. I am a little surprised that you can't share anything to Facebook even though you can log in with Facebook, though."", 'I used this regularly to track plantings then recently lost capacity to add anything (keyboard shut program down - checked updates etc). Uninstalled unfortunately.', ""I'm just getting started but so far it looks very functional and flexible. I'm going to set up each seed starting shelf as a separate Area. I'm tickled that it let me put a 🍅 in a plant name/label so I guess all my plants will have emojis this year.""]"

They keep your brain active by trying to work out the clues and the story telling and graphics are great.', 'I am not very far into the game, but so far I like it.

Graphics are excellent and, so far, it runs smoothly.', ""Great game, this my 3rd one from the series. Deserves more stars, but honestly, a few things bug me to the max: the molecule filtering doesn't make sense, eventhough I managed to pass it by trial and error. However, the rope challenge is just unacceptable, imho. The mirror goes up-down, but left is left?! Developers, stand in front of a mirror and tell me what you put in the game is how it works. Umm..no. Huge oversight there, as far as I'm concerned. Sorry"", ""Awesome game. I can't stop playing it. It really gets you to think about the clues that come up."", 'This is an amazing detective story if you love escape/mystery solving games then download this now it is my absolute favorite game ever even though I beat it like 20 times I still replay it', ""For the last couple of days, I have been playing all of the haiku adventure escape games I can. I quite enjoy them. Sometimes the answers seem impossible to connect, which is frustrating, but overall it's not enough to make me stop playing. The one thing that is really annoying me is the sound. I've turned off the music and sound in settings but I can still hear the sound effects. I want it to be completely muted. Am I missing something?"", ""Awsome game,but some parts having bugs in the levels like putting penny's accessories in the case it wasn't working quite well...but really a wonderful games and story line... graphics too"", 'Easier game..Good waste of a few hours....Easy listening mall music.. Logical clues..Alot of talky..*edit* Almost finished game. They like using this particular puzzle, where the user has to draw a line following a rope. Really frustrating. Not forgiving at all. There should be room for error; the hotspot coordinates, should at least be the thickness of rope. Had to quit, too frustrating.', ""I love your games but this one's crossed a line for me and put me off because of that's stupid rope puzzle when you have to follow the rope to undo it. On one of your other games when you had to use your finger to trace the rope it was hard enough if you have a smaller screen but I much preferred that. This one you have to use a pad at the bottom to draw on and trace the rope and the top part shows you where your moving the line. It's a good idea but it is buggy and tedious to use. I'm not a angry person and I've played some hard games but this made me so infuriated I nearly smashed my phone it all nearly brought me to tears. Your games are hard which is good as many escape games are too easy but this one puzzle is just horrible. It's inverted controls on this puzzle too and some times even when I'm going the right way in the centre of a rope line it decides I've gone off the edge when I haven't. The inverted controls on a already tedious puzzle when you don't have a stylus is also not fare on people who have trouble with their coordination. Also the line doesn't act the same way twice it starts off at different points and shoots off due to the inverted controls/ bug. This puzzle really needs some more work , I've un-installed this game and am re-installing it as I can't afford to put money to the game right now to buy hints, which I'm annoyed about as I have a feeling this puzzle is bad so you have to buy hints sorry if I'm wrong but it seems this way. Once I re-install it I will save up the stars to skip the rope puzzle. I feel bad only giving three stars as your games really are good and worth downloading I love challenging puzzles but that rope puzzle really takes the shine of this one."", 'your games are fun keep up the good work! ill be sure to download more! however only 4 stars because some of the problems you cant use stars to get the answer and some you can!should be all problems', 'I did not like this game in the begaining the waiting for stars to play was a bit long but i like it,its challaging but rewarding when you figure it out i think im hooked.great work develeper.', ""Puzzle in the statue garden doesn't work. I solved it 3 times and even had a friend check it to make sure I hadn't overlooked something."", ""Really enjoying this game. The puzzles aren't impossible nor are they too easy. Definitely enjoying it and recommend it to people who enjoy puzzle games with a story line."", 'Very interesting game.. I m Soo exited to play more levels... Only the problem is we are unable to see stars while playing game😆other wise very good', ""I don't like being forced to buy clues, sometimes there is no directions or an objective.."", ""It's fun, and has the right amount of difficulty. There were some minigames which I think could be improved though (one is the puzzle after the statue, it's a bit difficult to move the pieces; another is the molecule puzzle which took up too much time when you got it wrong (there's no skip button for every try)). I loved the rope puzzle the best, very frustrating, but very rewarding once I finished it, haha! Short game, could be finished in an hour or so :))"", ""Good story, some funky control issues and non intuitive parts, but I am scoring it low because little thought was put into how it would translate to Android. I love challenging puzzles but had many issues that required a walkthrough, simply because I was unable to see and click on something about 2 pixels wide, etc. It was still a reasonably good game until the rope-tracing challenge, which was so tortuously tedious that I gave up (which I almost never do). It wasn't fun anymore. Sorry, but this should have been altered for small screen phones after being adapted for Android. These are meant to be relaxing games, and I can't waste my life on a sadistic puzzle like that. I'd have paid a couple bucks for stars to skip, but the $5 being asked for is way too much, given the length of the game. Too bad; I liked the game before it (Carnival) and enjoyed the storyline and music in this one more...but the puzzles were subpar."", 'Adventure escape never disappoints. Always a good story line and good puzzles. Easy enough to enjoy with some that boggle the mind and drive me crazy.', ""Some of the puzzles in the game wasn't easy. Some of the logic to get to the puzzle didn't make sense to me. But over all it was still fun."", 'Like most games from this company, Its a blast to play. Well worth your time.']"

And the elements are infinite so u don't never run out of resources. These devs kind of out of the box with this game, awesome! Kudos to the devs for a job well done! 🤗 And as a side note, read what the characters are saying, sometimes it's humorous, and give tips on the game! 😊"", ""The game is kind of fun but storage is small and cant be expanded without waiting an extremely long time to accumulate Crystal's or spending money. If your storage gets full you get stuck for a while. On top of that it restarts every few minutes saying I need a good wifi connection ( which I have) When I went to report the issue it puts you on a page to email them with no apparent way to actually send it. Kinda frustrating."", ""It is a fantastic game. It takes elements from little alchemy and merves it into a world building simulation. However the game is crazy unbalanced. It costs 600 coins to get a building but it only gives you 23 to 35 coins for a mission. The crafting of elements takes longer than 1 min and 30 seconds each item and there are dependent of each other meaning you can't sell anything because you need it. It takes longer than 1h to receive a villager. All these make the game a grind."", ""Well it started off nice but for some reason around the time i hit level 3 or 4 it just continues to crash over and over saying i don't have an internet connection... ridiculous since im writting this review and have submitted a complaint. Its literally stuck in a repeat cycle now turning on, loading, congratulating for gaining a level, and immediately crash with this error. I might rate it better if i could have gotten further into the game, or maybe it should be fully offline."", ""Wow I really like this game. It is relaxing and really fun to play with great challenges. Even the ads are perfectly placed with great rewards. The graphics is really nice. It is just an over all fun game. I have been looking for a game like this for a long time. I'm glad I found it. I would recomend this game to every one."", 'Great little game, plenty to keep you occupied. It is interesting in concept and design. I hope that you do update it though and allow for more map types or more land period. I would like to see how this game grows. I like how the elements are put together to make everything work Great job!', 'This game should be upgraded to a platform video game. I mean I love the idea of the god like aspect. But I love the most the resources management. It would be awesome for chain production and complex activities with the spice of God like feature!!! Love it!', 'I was really enjoying this game, but it has suddenly stopped working. I cannot open the game anymore even after reinstalling. Unfortunate really, as the game is simple but complex at the same time and loads of fun.', 'Fun game. Very different from any other game I have seen out there. The only thing is that it needs more instructions on how to develop the things in the quests. It can be difficult to complete quests when you have no idea how to make the things needed.', ""The game is very pleasant. It is also a thinker of where to place objects. The music is nice and the graphics are smooth. I really like the game. The only problem I have is when I make a volcano, it just won't let me. Meh. But other than that flaw, the game is pretty fun and relaxing."", 'Most exciting game I have played. Graphics are great, gameplay is very good, I like the fact that you have to place buildings next to resources it feels more real. For people that are into world/city building/management games I really recommend this game.', ""I love it! Really fun game! Please make many more like this! If you do let me know !? I'll play it so I can kill time when I need too. Absolutely enjoy this game nothing wrong with it on my end it's super fun."", ""UNCLE. No guidance on what you should do. Nice new angle with elements, but to stumble around for hours getting no where is not my idea of a good evening. And after a few hours it seems that the 2 aspects of the game don't even to effect each other. What a waste of space."", ""Disappointing I have been in touch with makers of game but no success I'm playing this game on my tablet then all of a sudden I keep getting message saying check your Internet connection which I did I can play other games but not this one very disappointed with makers not fixing the issue that I have mentioned so its not my Internet connections must be the game might need updating"", 'Visually I enjoy this game, it is well orgsnised and is probably great for kids because it teaches them a little about life etc but! My biggest gripe here is that I am a vegetarian. I dont appreciate having to slaughter animals for food especially considering there is enough vegetation to support the community. I know this is a game but it is still unethical in my personal opinion. Not everyone wants nor do they even need to eat animals. It is NOT nescessary for the continuation of life.', ""This game is amazing. Excellent sandbox and creationist game However please make it so you can pan the camera out further. Also now that I've discovered everything. It's gotten rather boring. Needs more."", 'I am really enjoying this game, love that you can really zoom in, but wish you could zoom out further too. Other than that It has been pretty great so far.', 'Started out as a great game, but then it became harder and harder to gain coins and upgrade. Once the island gets to big there is no option to zoom out.', ""Excellent spin on the alchemy games, you have to mix elements etc to create different things, which then come to life on screen, only downside I've found so far is I wish I could zoom out a little!"", 'Love this game its easy to extend as much land as you want, its easy to play n the rewards are great.', ""Very unique building game, you create the trees, rocks ,fish, I find it very entertaining. I love building games and this is the coolest I've ever played."", 'Game is slow to level. Sort of forces the purchase of gems to proceed without waiting a month or so......otherwise its an ok game.', 'It crashes a few minutes while playing and you cant play anymore because the game closes instantly when the game starts..', 'I enjoyed it. But tben before i could build tbe world market it crash. I deleted after playing all day. Reinstald 4 times but it now wont start tbe game', 'Having a connection issue then lost my account, ive sent a request and yet no answers after over 2 weeks of waiting', 'Seemed like a great game, but nothing built right and elements would disappear as soon as I placed them', 'Very enjoyable game, really good graphics and addictive', 'So glad there is always new levels etc keeps the game interesting', 'Good game love the aspect it would be good if there was a battling aspect involved', ""I really like the alchemy style reactions. I hope they'll add more variety in the future."", 'Fun game so far, takes a bit of time to get started', 'Fun and engaging with neat graphics', 'Its a good idea, but trying to create certain geographical features (like waterfalls, plateaus, rocks coming up from the Ocean, or a mountain range) It would be better to start with cavepeople and to transition through the decades. I also think it would have been cool trying to create like dinsinctive animals like a wholly mammouth or even sabor tooth tiger. It would be pretty cool to like cause weather conditions or to even natural disasters!', 'Nice and time killing game good graphics.', 'Great game but storage could be better', 'I got to say I been waiting for a game like this ware u can build the land ,make anything u want I love it , thanks who ever invented this game', 'Wow this game is edgy bonk I love how you have to create land and life mixed with farming and building well done best farming and building game so far 5 stars plus more if i could', 'Cant log in says connection error??? Um help?', ""Honestly it's a fun and interesting game however, I paid for the Crystal Tree to get the quest out of the way, they took the money but havent received the tree , any help or reply from the devs. Use extra caution when purchasing from this app. :/""]"

I really enjoy playing it and it's one of the better games in this genre that I've played. There's a few let downs, like not being able to roam 360 with the camera.But I can still look past that.

When you spend $ so that you can progress you expect to progress. I\'ve reached out to them many times the past year and they say ""it takes time to develop new levels"". I agree that it does, but not a year! I play other games that have added/updated a min of 5 times in that amount of time. They should refund people that spent $!', ""Warning the super deal is a total scam I spent $8 and got NOTHING! I accidentally allowed the purchase because they keep popping it up in my face when I am trying to start playing and I thought oh well I will see what I get. I finally figured out what I get big crystals for the puzzle games. I am annoyed that the purchase comes up on its own because I have ADHD so if someone is talking to me I can't focus enough to think and I will push on the purchase. It's not ok!"", ""Game was great at first but now I have issues and have deleted it. After using supplies they should disappear instead you have to give them away very much takes away from the play. Now I was trying to divert power after using several crystals I gave up. Good luck to anyone who can figure it out as for me I'm finding a new game"", ""I do very much enjoy this game, and I like the interesting premise as well. I didn't have any problems with the gameplay at all until I got to the lake location and now it just constantly freezes on my phone no matter what I do. I'm not sure what's going on, as I haven't had any issues in the previous locations. Another thing I'll say is that sometimes I think the levels of puzzles required to complete a task is a bit high, but other than that I do enjoy the game."", ""The mini match 3 games totally ruin the gameplay for me,if I wanted to play that type of game I'd have downloaded candy crush, I've been trying 2 mini games for 3 days now cannot get past them,totally bored of the game now as cannot progress so deleting and looking for something else,pity really looked like it was going to be a good game too"", 'Agree with other reviews of this game. The idea is good but the puzzle games where you match three colours are insanely hard and you are forced to buy crystals to compete. They clearly have you over a barrel and its a complete rip off in my opinion. Maybe have a feature where you can earn crystals over time rather than having to buy them would be helpful but if its not likely to change then more people will be voting with their feet by deleting the app.', ""The game itself is okay there can be some trying times Got to the end of the game in November or December of 2019 still waiting for update at this time that's a joke I honestly don't feel they're going to update it otherwise they would have already updated it they've since July of 2019 to do it. Don't even bother till they get the new update out I'm contemplating uninstalling it. Got better things to do than to keep waiting on them to get off their ass."", 'I like the concept of the game, but only want to play for free. Because you cannot earn crystals, but must buy them, I have a feeling I will be deleting this game soon. I have only been playing a few weeks and it is slow-going because of lack of crystals. Sorry I used them up in the first location.', ""No way to toggle tutorial, seriously, in this day and age? Not everyone needs their hand held. Match 3 mini games (with tutorial, ugh) are aimed at the exceptionally lazy. Haven't moved in 2 seconds? Why, you must be stuck, here's how to play again. That's a no from me. Uninstalled."", ""Decent enough game. Have dropped a star on the rating because having finally got to the end of the volcano level, when I try to progress just get a message saying you are 'working on'a new chapter, with a few teaser pictures. Have been waiting weeks now and still no updates. It's very annoying to have got this far only to find there is nowhere else to go (yet) but not to have completed the game. Please sort this out asap."", ""I have had this game on my phone for several years. Always got stuck on a level and stopped playing for a while. I started back a couple months ago and advanced in the game more than i ever have until I got to adding ingredients to the circle. I saw another reviewer say the same thing. Once you pass the 1st match game, the blasters keep going and you can't finish the level! Very disappointed. Ive wasted so much money and now I cant even continue on to finish the game?"", ""I enjoyed playing this game at first but I've been stuck on 'adding ingredients to circle' puzzle game for about 3 months now because the blasters keep going off and not allowing the level to complete, no matter what I try do. It's getting to the point I will be deleting the game. No point playing something if you can't move on. Sort the problem and I'll change my review."", ""It's great so far, I like it but my only concern is the match 3! When I want to switch to make a move sometimes it goes the opposite way? It's either I have big fingers or the tiles are too small and saying that I would recommend the game."", 'At first I thought ""oh no, not my kind of game"" but decided to give it a go. Glad I did! The storline has grabbing power ( it must because I absolutely hate match 3 puzzles). I can barely keep my phone charged because I keep wanting to see what happens to the Survivors next! LATER NOTE : Don\'t download unless you LOVE match 3 games. They are miserably endless!', ""The game is challenging, some of the items are hard to see. It would be nice to be able to zoom in a bit more. I played this game a few years ago when the match 3 or more was on a timer. Back then it was too hard to complete those games, now it's doable with a few tries. Overall I like the story, kinda reminds me of Lost, so it makes me want to find out the mystery of the island."", ""Bad game, unless u want to spent a lot of real money to be able to play. A good game should be fun n not stressful! Match 3 games become the main game n many impossible to finnish without boosters bought with real money. Moves r limited n then it keeps telling u no moves! N i'm in 3rd base out of 10 base. Bad business strategy, developer. Lower price n easier game sell more, u know"", ""Ok now I'm not impressed. After you've done an update you've made the game great to play again. 1/11/18 What's going on with this game? I've been playing this game for over a year now and all of a sudden it takes me 15 times to open the game to get my rewards!!!? If I don't keep closing the game then opening it to check if I have my daily reward I loose the rest of the weeks worth... Come on, you need to fix this error!!!"", ""This is the second time I've tried doing this game. I love all the tasks where you have to find objects, make collections and do different things... but as I have said before and after reading other people's comments on the forum everyone is fed up with the match 3 games, I have been stuck on level 3 of the cooler for a really long time. Please consider changing these games so they are either easier or not there! Don't really need them as there is so much to do anyway. Thanks for reading x"", ""Love this game..... but now half way through the mountain plateau level it's become groundhog day... every time I enter the game I need to redo everything again... Even the daily bonus doesn't remember ..... Apart from that the game is great .."", ""Avoid this money magnet. The match 3 games are annoying with limited moves and annoying grid layouts designed to use your limited gems to get extra moves and then having to pay real cash to replenish them to progress. Stupidly to create food you have to play up to 3 grids to make them. Sub games to progress can be 4 or more. Can see this game costing hundreds to complete. If you thought EA games were bad for in app purchases they're Saints compared to this company."", ""Good game but I have no clue how much is the only one that is so true.. I know that I'm going back and get some rest ... You're welcome and thanks again so much for the day off tomorrow .. I'm not sure if it's just that you can come over here like at all, excited about the other side is the only thing that has been in my views... Enjoy playing the game.."", ""This game is almost impossible to play without making purchases! Even when I searched for items, I couldn't find them because they didn't look like what they were, they were barely visible. This game is ridiculous"", ""its like the movie kinda it takes a long time and you need lots of diamonds to really play the game if you don't have a lot of diamonds and you not going to get very far in this game so good luck and it's okay when I'm very bored and have nothing else to do that's when I play this game"", ""i just can not find hints??? I mean you have little pic that i click on and that drop down menu tells me what to try todo but it is one of the hardest games but it does try my patience i really don't have time to check out the games pagebut i gave it a three ... up from last review 2"", ""The puzzle game to be played for almost all steps is frustrating and waste of time. The matches could be reduced to 1 game instead of 3-5. Thinking of uninstalling the game all because of the puzzle game.this game should be a survival game not a match pieces game.moreover some levels of the match colors game are extremely difficult making it more time wasting and frustrating.the developers could do a lot better by tuning the game and reducing the match colors game as well as it's difficulty."", 'The game is fun, but i get bored with having only 1 mini game of gem matching. Wish they could witch it up and do multiple mini games such as a word search, matching, seek and find, crossword, etc.', ""I love the game..but I'm in the tropical forest and on the first game for the circle of stones and I moved a few things and won it but now it won't stop running..it's been 45 min and still won't stop..as long as the poweruos keep falling it keeps goi ng...if I log out and come back it does the same thing...please help."", 'I have gotten to the cruise ship level. Been waiting for an update and they wont return my email. Going to uninstall game soon if I dont get an answer. Still no update or answer from g5. Deleted every game from them and WILL NOT PLAY ANY OF THEIR GAMES AGAIN. NEGATIVE 5 STARS FROM ME.', ""Good game. Interesting to play along with 3 matches mini game. I would like if the game do not interrupt showing other games of g5 to play. And i don't understand why there is low space for storage?"", ""I like to know more about the story but the match 3 puzzles aren't fun and are frustrating!!! I can't get any further in the story because the puzzle is unforgiving and it doesn't give enough moves to finish the puzzle. The story is pretty good though."", 'Another match 3 game which is impossible to beat, plus no updates since i started playing over a year ago, dont bother downloading, developers are on a permanent holiday and never coming back.', 'It does need patience. I have reached the side of the volcano without spending any money, but am unable to board the cruise ship as there is still no update from G5. I would love this adventure to continue and get my castaways on board the ship', ""It's good, but it needs to make up its mind on whether it is a survival game or a match 3 game. I love match 3 but the amount of them and difficulty (2 to 3 per item) make the match 3 really annoying to play and make you want to quit since you can't advance without beating them. It'd be fine if it wasn't required. I was drawn to the game thinking it was survival, not a matching game."", ""It's a really good app. Love the game play. Only thing is when searching for things it's super difficult it find some stuff and I dont enjoy using my diamonds when I cant even see it on the main screen. Other than that I really like it."", 'Was really enjoying it but this is the third day in a row where it crashes on me. I just reached the alien ship and if I try to move to the right of the ship the game just closes out every single time. Please fix this because I would like to continue.', 'Some of the puzzles are very difficult with no moves after 1 or 2 plays. Expensive and no way to earn power crystals only for purchase. Graphics could be better some required items are blended into background and difficult to find.', 'The only problem with this game is you cannot win diamonds from any level completions, you have to spend real money to buy combo helpers, and you I cant afford to buy with real money. Unfortunately about to delete the game.', 'Good game. But the side game (match 3) took so long. If it take 1 game to complete, it will be great. But it took up to 3 gake to complete a task. Too long.', ""I love this game. Very exciting every challenges.but something it's so very hard to fine it. But I really really enjoy it😍😍"", 'THE FIRST EVER match 3 game about stranded in my life i just survive meet new people and forever fight in monsters and the BAD news is the games creativity is going down i love the map but if loading is done it crashes no tablets phones only people']"

At level 9, I was asked to build a quarry, a manor or upgrade my warehouse because you have be level 11. Then you run into the issue that, now, you need upgrade other things before you can do any of that. Perhaps you should just get level friendly goals."", ""I'm actually really enjoying this game! I was worried at first if it would be another city builder you had to put money into..but so far so good! There's always some quests to work on and something to do. However I can't complete some quests that require Facebook.. seems like that's an ongoing problem for a lot of people. Besides that, I think having some regular civilians besides the workers walking around would be a cute addition :) Still a fun game though!"", ""I enjoy the game.but I feel like I am being robbed out of my free gyms daily since I have started this game because it always tells me that I have no internet service. I'd like to mention that not only do I have unlimited on my plan I also have Wi-Fi. I would love to give you a better rating but until this problem I cannot."", ""So far this is awesome! Adorable characters too! Love the little free roaming critters! Only bad thing is it's not letting me add friends from Facebook. I keep getting an error message, yet I can easily do it on other games. I even tried completely deleting it and reloading from scratch."", ""This was my favorite game. But since my tablet died on me and I am now using my phone I cannot get back to my original game. I tried to uninstall and reinstall the game but that didn't work. I went to achievements and found my account logged out and logged back in but that didn't work either. Please help me as I really enjoyed playing this game before. My account is Pooky 97667. I was on level 21."", ""I played this game for over a year. I spent a good amount of money. I enjoyed it. However when I had an issue moving my progress from one phone to another there was no help.

However, when I leave the game then come back hours later all the timers are still where they were before I left the game. This is so stupid! Do I have to keep the game open on my phone just to keep the countdown going??? First game I've ever had an issue with the timers not counting down while out of the game."", 'Still having issues logging with facebook. to save my game for other phones etc, its not really helpful since i then have to start over each time since it never carries.

Had all the areas across the water open, etc."", ""I was playing the game with no problems, then suddenly it wouldn't progress further. Any upgrades I did were not upgraded I left the game, even if they finished upgrading before I left. But the coins and diamonds were taken for them. If I moved a building it would be in the original spot when I came back too. You are lucky that I like the game, I uninstalled then reinstalled. If it happens again I will uninstall for good. Did the Developers abandone this game?"", ""I used to play this on Facebook until my computer broke. I'm not really a fan of mobile games, let alone building ones, but had I known this was downloadable for mobile I definitely would've downloaded sooner. My only complaint is that, unless I've overlooked it, there isn't an option to link to the Facebook version which kinda sucks. I made it so far through the main story that I legitimately felt bumbed when my computer broke."", 'So far game,runs smooth. Very simple interface and clean frame rate with solid graphics. I can already tell 2 days in that if your f2p the grind is gonna be epic but I like that in a kingdom building sim so no real complaints at this point.', ""Some of the options like getting free gems or workers are not working. I uninstalled and reinstalled the game and it doesn't let me go back to the saved game even though it is in the cloud."", 'Great game to play when no Internet. Frost land ""Journey"" keeps saying no Internet even when there is Internet connection. Can\'t complete task because of it.', ""I like this game but every other to i open the game I cannot control it on my phone. When I touch the screen something else happens other than what I picked. For instance I am trying to dig up grass it will think I am pressing on a building that is close by. I just get frustrated and I have to press my home screen to get out of the game. Then it doesn't close."", 'I enjoyed the game until my son accidentally deleted the game on my phone..so downloaded the game again and can see previous game on cloud but i keep on getting an error message that i cannot download it...it keeps on telling me unable to retrieve..something whatever..', ""It is a good game, only things in don't care for is u can't connect to Facebook, u can not rotate the island to see around buldings to see for trees bushes treasure chest or mushrooms, way too many quests at once, way too much gold to buy new land, not using my personal money to use on game to further advance in the game. The times for things to build or upgraded is way too long, when you try to get items u need for a quest, as in fighting the gouls, u don't get what u need,"", 'Excellent graphics, intriguing story and characters. Time consuming resource collection. Good controls, not over complicated process.', 'Best be ready to pay to play. You have to put house within the castle walls and theres very little room, cant move or get rid of roads which restricts where you can put the houses. There is a space you can clear but it costs 150k gold and it will take you forever to save that up and even then its tiny. Same with outside the castle. Space is small, cant move roads, cant have many buildings takes forever to level up happiness w/out spending money and you cant open up new territories without it.', 'Bad.. Fair warning to ALL.. This game can lose/reverse your progress when you close it !!! Imagine all your efforts gone when you return to play it later. That is the worst case scenario of any game like this.', 'Its not all that good from the 1st original tribez game. This version of the game progress is so slow it seems like theyre almost forcing one to you to buy ingame items in order to move along a little quicker.', ""This is a good time killer with plenty to do however the task progress logic won't accept you doing your own thing and you may have to repeat builds just to appease the task list. I have tried adventures and won't be doing again as the game deleted my progress even though it was in one evening and the game was never closed."", 'Ive give this game a three star because it takes forever to do anything. Plus you cant buy any buildings because of no room because you cant expand without request. The request ast for building that you cant get because of buying defense buildings.... It would help if i can log on facebook to get friends. Everytime i try it says this game cant. If they can get that fix maybe everything else i said wil chang for the better. Ill keep playin and hope for the best', ""No development or support Cant do anything that requires connection the games server or Facebook. Which makes me think the this game is no longer supported by the developers lots of people having this same issue. Ok game to play just don't waste any money on it. Pop up ads trying to get you to spend money every few mins. Such a shame cause it could be a good little game."", 'The game is fun. The game does not provide enough gems an coins to advance without paying real money for them. People do not want to pay to advance forward.', ""Very fun, I just don't seem to get the free gems. It tells me I'm not online, or just doesn't do anything."", ""I've already played this game and I really enjoyed it. The graphics the story is very nice. A really good time killer with a little bit of a challenge."", 'Can NOT connect to Facebook due to how the login is implemented despite trying every couple of months for about the FIVE YEARS I have been playing the game.', 'I spent ages playing this game and then I had to do a factory reset on my device. I reinstalled the game to load ny cloud save (like ive done before) and didnt get the option to so I just played for a second to see if the cloud save option would appear later it didnt. I uninstalled and then reinstalled to which it then showed me the option to start from the cloud save HOWEVER that was a cloud save from where I was level 4 after playing for a little bit instead of my level 30 ish save that I want', 'I used to play this game a few years back. Recently decided to come back and have another play, only to find that it hasn\'t been supported in 2 years, while the earlier ""the tribes"" is still being supported, and that game is far inferior to this one, so bye... I\'ve played 2 games by Game Insight, probably will never play another', 'Great game overall. But I found one problem. The sound was very echoic when I connect with my bluetooth speaker. Please fix this problem!', ""I keep on losing my game. I uninstall and reinstall and still doesn't help. Whenever it tries to recover data from cloud it just states 'something's wrong' and then nothing. It's very frustrating... especially for an actual good game otherwise. Please fix your bugs!"", ""I really like this game and would rate it higher but there seems to be an issue with logging on with Facebook so I can't add any friends."", 'Fun game but cant acess fasebook related stuff or friends. Also would be nice if could have started off where I left off in past.', 'Fun game but the touch is off making it unplayable. I tap on a building and it pulls up the building above the one I tapped']"

Small UI fixes","[""Random 30 second ads without rewards lately, not a good look. EDIT: sorry, trying to be more constructive now. You should get paid, it's the randomness that's disruptive and bothering me. Banners are great, ads I click on for little rewards are great. I'd even be down to watch a certain amount of ads with no rewards, like instead of paying. Just random ads are such a no-go for me personally. I'll try to watch more ads for gems in the future, I always forget that's a thing."", ""Great game! It's really addictive; you don't have to invest real money in it if you're prepared to take a bit longer to get what you want. I love it. Edit: I've been playing for a while now, and wanted to update my review (which I don't tend to ever do, but I like this game a lot). You don't have to 'pay to win', but the price of additional gems is reasonable. You also have the opportunity to earn gems by watching ads, but i't's a choice; ads don't interrupt you [UPDATE: Now they do. Great. /s]"", ""I kinda like it. It's different from most other building/trading games. Definitely have to strategize the use of resources. I wish more could be accomplished in the idle time, without requiring gold, but that's a minor gripe. I'll play it for a while and see what else can be done."", ""I get bored of games quick but this has been a long time keeper for me. Total win developers. Also like how even though there are in-app purchases the game doesn't force purchases down your throat like most idle games do, big plus."", 'Great game, and amazing customer support! I had an issue with the game not loading and just showinf a white screen. Contacted support and it was resolved within a couple hours!!', 'Enjoyable This is by far the best clicker game I have played. Lots to do to keep you coming back. Also they are easy to get ahold of and respond quickly and work with you to get any problems worked out', ""Released a patch today... you added nothing that benefits players, yet put in forced ads into a game with low incentive to play? I'll be sure to lookout for all of your future apps and stay away from them."", ""Had some problems before register issue was fixed and lost goodies when changed to different device but contacted developer and he fixed everything and helped with some tips on game....note to everyone: you cannot do a progress reset till you've built EVERYTHING! Really like this game....you do need to buy a couple of things and do think $4.99 is a bit steep for the ship in the bottle, but always quests...can get gems free everyday for watching ads and decent level up rewards...FUN!"", 'Still lacks refinement, but overall a good idea, and decent implementation.', 'The game just suddenly stopped working, when I open it I just get a blank white screen', ""I really enjoy this game, I've been playing it months now. It is almost relaxing or satisfying in a way once you get things going smoothly, and you do not need to micromanage every little thing constantly, which is nice."", 'Love the game, i spend hours on it when i have nothing to do.. its a great time killer.. an its fun to just tap away.... cant stop playing.. just dont want to put it down, every time i do i just find myself tapping away more', ""This is kind of a grind and Im in the middle on having to spend gold to pay workers. While I like the idea, if you run of gold and have all your ships out then you're kinda screwed and have to wait. Still addictive"", 'The game keeps resetting after login out so progress is unattainable.', 'Great Game! If you have any issues the Dev quickly responds and works to make them right. Can pick up and play for a few minutes and actually see progress.', ""Simple yet addicting game. The only thing I don't like is how long it takes the boats to get to cities. Otherwise I enjoy it a lot. It's kinda relaxing."", 'Pretty neat game. Needs to give better instructions on game play. All in all a good time killer and no ads unless you want more gems!..', ""The best idle game I've played. Gives me a reason to log in and progress, really relaxing to play too."", 'Thank you for fixing the issue. Great game. Keep up the good work.', 'Very fun. Slow at 1st. I recomend building a bunch of inns and upgrade your workers.', 'Good game, tapping gets a bit tiresome though so would like more opportunities to automate the coin resource', ""Best tap game that I've ever played. Still playing after all this time I think I'm addicted to this simply brilliant game."", ""Very good game I have been playing for a long time and it's really growing on me I would recommend this to you"", 'The best still after months of playing. Still true after new year and still playing daily.', 'Entertaining and good to pass time with.', ""I have a good time clicking away. It's like slamming the old phone receiver to hang up."", 'Fun for an idle game. No pop up or banner ads', 'pretty fun easy to play and a bit addictive the events are neat to', 'Fun good time killer but the exploring is too long', 'Level builders, get big. Restart and get bigger', ""I wanted to write a new review since I've better figured out how the game works. It's a great game, bit that much content, but something makes you want to keep goin! My biggest complaint is when you beat round 1 and reset the game, everything takes WAY too many clicks/taps. Like, an absurd amount! The leveling system needs reworked cause it definitely does not level you equal to what's needed to play. It takes me all day just to refill my wood now haha it's to the point where I cant even play."", ""The game is alright, but if I have one complaint it's workers. They never stop being annoying above all else. Edit for a suggestion: Make the workers able to get percentage bonuses like the player. They're mad powerful in this kind of game, and would be far easier to implement and understand than whatever the leveling system is doing."", ""It's my favorite clicker game. Highly recommend. A few extra instructions towards the end would be more helpful. Maybe a hint button for people who might be missing something obvious.... I mean, I wouldn't know anyone like that... thanks for a great game!"", ""It's an interesting game but clicking is tiring"", ""Still getting an idea of how to play. Many locked areas, but nothing to tell you to how unlock them. Not a lot of direction on what to do once you level up certain areas so high you can't afford to level up anymore. For some people, it's a cool thing to explore amd find these things, for others, it's very annoying. Other than that. Very unique and fun to play."", 'Love it! Great game to play if you have a few minutes or hours to fill time. Easy to figure out and plenty of goals to achieve. Would love to see a chance to watch more than 3 videos a day for gems. You made a wonderful universal commodity but very difficult to get without paying. Maybe up the number to 5 or 6, would make a significant change in gameplay strategy and you get to show more ads.', ""It's a clicker game as advertised but a bit different. Getting to build up your resources and unlocking new buildings is fun and it's a good game. The issues I have is finding new mines of worth whether it's what you need or want takes waaaaaay too long. You get to a point where your just waiting for ships to return in the hope they bring you the resource you need."", ""Love it! Challenging yet easy to play. Just the right amount of clicker, idle, management, and simulation. I love that I can decide how long to idle, based on my schedule for the day. Been playing for over a month and it's still fun. Hope they keep the growth opportunities coming so I can keep playing, building, harvesting, and exploring. Thank you for the wonderful game!"", 'I love building and this game allows you to do just that. Good pacing and a pleasingly modest challenge level guarantees a satisfying game for as long as you like.', 'The game is moderately entertaining. No cloud support, no offline mode, if not ""signed in"" you stand a very high chance of losing your save data. The microtransactions are insane and if you are a F2P player, progress will be very slow very fast. Youll be struggling to progress by the end of playthrough 1. Just to get enough resources youll be waiting for days on the few ships you have. It can pass time when you\'re bored, however, there\'s a notable pay-wall that the game seems balanced around.']"

I'm not going to waste my money on diamonds and there's not enough opportunities to get materials to expand. I have about 20 businesses in storage and still not enough materials to expand.

I'm essentially facing a concrete wall, holding only a leaf and it would be easier for me to walk around the wall and delete the game."", ""So I love the game BUT after awhile it gets rather challenging to expand because you RARELY get any shovels and you constantly run out of space and are trying to decide what to build.

Waiting too long is putting me off playing the game at the minute. Make it so you get them more often please. Got to level 23 but can't go any further.

Its more time waster game. Graphics and art is pretty good, you can craft resources, build houses, but just expand population and upgrading the city hall each time. Kind like every MMO building up city game out there but offline sort game...but tutorial there no exit. There no means earn violet gems unless there is way but seeing is believing. If you hold out without spending then your are skilled gamer."", ""its weird and like a little creepy that this game hasn't been updated in almost two & a half years. i actually spent money on this as recently as a month ago cause its really quite a good city building game. not too simple and not too complex. its just weird that the game never changes there are no events nothing. just stuck in time in the mid '10s. odd"", ""The game is very fun but it doesn't respond please fix the glitch if it's not a glitch then let me know also let me know if you can't fix it if you can't fix it then I'm uninstalling the game if you can't fix it"", 'Game is fun.

You need gems to buy 99% of everything no cash you earn but only gems which make it where you can't decorate the town. Even when you level up everything you can buy is with gems.

“I'm so high on this because it's the best of every world. I'm not spending hours and hours senselessly grinding, and I'm not cooking fake food until my eyes bleed. The mix of action and simulation feels right. The pacing is good.” -toucharcade.com

“It's a massive game, with a seriously smart idea that has been executed well. If you're hooked by RPGs and find simulations addictive, this game might just eliminate your free time altogether.” -Pocket Gamer

“We spent way more time than we bargained for with a near-final build as we got sucked into its intricacies, but we’ve managed to tear our thumbs away from the touchscreen long enough to write up some impressions.” -iFanzine.com

After you close a portal it takes up to 10 hours for the next one to open. There's not really anything you can do besides water your plants while you wait for the next one.

As it is now it's doesn't really hold my interest."", ""If you love adventure games like me, you should try this, it's worth it. However, the cons here is that the storage, you always have to minimize your things in order for your new things be stored.

I use it on the daily.', ""I love this app. It's so convenient to have all the info I need whether it be villagers favorite gifts or the community center checklist and even just knowing when the last day to plant certain crops in time for one last harvest of that specific crop. Honestly the app was a steal for the price its priced at. And with daily advice like what days to check the TV at and what days you can visit the traveling cart this app is well worth every penny!"", 'Such a great app! It is exactly what I was looking for! Also, the fact that the developer plans on adding things suggested by the SV community is just amazing. Thank you so much for creating this wonderful app! I look forward to the future updates you have planned, and other updates that come about along the way. :)', ""This is an amazing app to use with Stardew Valley! It helps you keep track of everything, from to do lists for each in-game day, to what types of fish you've caught, to every individual villagers likes and dislikes! The user interface is incredibly clean and so easy to use. Love it!"", ""I absolutely love this app. I've used it every time I play stardew valley to keep track of everything. It's been a lifesaver tracking bundles and villager likes/dislikes especially. I wish it had more in it about the game itself, like where to find items besides fish and bundle items or a list of automatic NPC requests in our journal. This app gets the job done, but it has so much potential for more."", ""The app is very clean and user friendly. The low score comes from the fact that it is overall very lacking in its content and absolutely not worth paying for. No villagers schedule, no crafting list, no collections list (just the museum and fish)... Really the bare minimum. You're better off having the wiki open and downloading one of the many available spreadsheet with checklists."", 'App is awesome and very helpful. Saves a lot of time running back and forth to the community center, which is the main reason I bought the app. Couple things that could make it better, add event information, and the ability to have multiple profiles(?) for multiple saves.', 'perfect companion for tracking your progress across multiple farms. Very helpful daily reminder of to-dos to help you keep up with recipes and the traveling salesman. Community center and museum progress checklist is fantastic and accompanied by very useful images of all items. locations and times for all fish. Just the best companion to an amazing game. lots of updates and bug fixes as well. truly an app that is more than just a money grab. 2 word review: WORTH IT!', ""This app is a really wonderful companion to the game. UI is very clean and easy to use, and I love being able to add notes and keep track of bundles. I'd love to be able to have more info on farming though, like a planner of how many days to harvest, that sort of thing!"", ""I love this app, it's very user friendly and definitely helps me keep on top of things like birthdays and the community bundles, amongst other things. Would be great to see an update with information on how to trigger heart events under each villager."", ""Love the app, really useful so I don't miss the traveling cart and the queen of sauce episodes, birthdays and such. I would rate 5 stars if the villagers location schedules were in the app instead of an external link, as well as a list of what the universal loves /likes/ neutral /dislike gifts are."", ""This app helps me keep track of all the items I harvested, found, and donated. The app gives a daily list that helps the farmer know when to plant certain items. Get this app if you want to maximize your Stardew experience. I'm so glad I found it!"", ""Absolutely beautiful and such a helpful app, especially when I'm playing on the bus and I don't have internet to look up stuff. Simple and easy to use. I hope the schedule of each character is eventually added if it isn't too difficult!!"", 'This app is pretty useful. I love the tips about last day to plant crops. Would be very convenient to be able to search items to see which bundle uses it. A lot of times I know I need something but I cant remember which bundle it goes in. Once that feature is added I think its worthy of 5 stars', 'this app is great! i use it often, however i wish that you didnt have to leave the app to look at npc character schedules, and i wish it would also say what materials youd need for buildings (ie. coops, barns, sheds). i still have to go on the wiki or ask robin what i need.', ""This is exactly what I was looking for. It reminds you of things to do during specific days and is especially useful if you don't want to miss out on anything. It's also a lot faster than searching for something on the wiki and even links you to it for certain things."", ""No more update. There's a better app which offers very much greater content. Not worth for money."", ""While not comprehensive (yet) this app is great! I can easily find what villagers love and special events. I didn't think I would use it very much when I first bought it. But I find I use it more than the wiki!"", 'i really like this app! very handy, organised and easy to use! the only thing i would say i miss are: 1. recipes and an additional checklist for every recipe (like fish and artifacts) 2. some type of search engine for all items that shows how much each villager likes the item', '4 stars for the planner calendar functionality... makes my life in stardew so much easier and productive!! couldnt be happier to have paid for this app. If i could make a suggestion to also include recipe and building ingredient breakdowns in their own sections so i can refer to the wiki even less... then ill change my review to 5 stars!', 'Hi! Thanks so much for putting this together, this is awesome! One suggestion - is it possible to have ""notes"" on file recurring annually (like your anniversary)? That would be awesome. Other than that, i\'m really diggin it! Thanks again!!', 'This is a great app! Easy interface, great day planner, but it seems to have everything but store and shop menus; that would be my one suggestion. Thank you for the great app :)', 'This is an amazing app. It was great with helping me not waste time in Stardew Valley. I especially love the fact that you can have multiple farms because I have the game for both PC and PS Vita.', 'really well done application. only a few small things missing, but they would take a lot of work to add (i.e. recipes, allow ediable notes (i made a spelling mistake in my one note so i had to retype)) but nothing major. :)', ""A huge help in such an overwhelming game! Would love to see other checklists that are essential to achievements as well, but otherwise, it's amazing and runs perfectly.""]"

I have been playing for almost two weeks now and have leveled up to rank 18 which has been fairly easy but not too hard. It has relaxing gameplay and works smoothly on my phone. You can do quite alot without resorting to in-game purchases. For controls, some improvements could be made in the area of sensitivity when placing buildings or moving buildings etc...

I have been really bored and these type of games are what I look for. Great job.', ""Pretty fun and challenging game. You have to think carefully how you are going to build your town. I was frustrated in the beginning and about to delete it. I'm manged to get through the rough spot and grow my town."", 'This game was so much fun!

I love the simple graphics, but the money system needs some work.. Spend to much and then oops, you gotta pay microtransactions (if its a very high negative number, by that I mean -400 or more), or wait for the game to help you out of that debt.

I Definitely wont spend any real money on it.', 'Overall, its enjoyable. However, I wish it was easier to maintain money and still develop the town at a reasonable pace.', ""I tried it again to remember why stopped it in the first place. It's a worse version of Edo Towns/Venture Towns which was fun and had faster pace.

Not only move costs ingame cash but on top you have 2 moves a day. It's insane."", 'I like the game. Dont like that it keeps prompting you to rate it. So now i am giving it 3 stars.

At this point I've spent more time tracking down errors and Tech Support than actually playing. If the game works, then it's awesome. But each day that becomes an even bigger IF. When the issue was an easy fix support got back to me right away. But now that the error isn't obvious they've sadly gone mute. And I'm left with a game I love, and can't play."", ""Overall, I'm thrilled to see a Harvest Moon game brought to mobile and done so well. Players of past games of this title will know exactly what to expect, and won't be disappointed. My biggest gripe is that this is one of the rare games that simply won't allow music or other apps to play in the background. I'd love to listen to music or catch up on some podcasts while doing the more routine aspects of this game rather than be forced to listen to the in-game soundtrack, but it force pauses any audio outside the game when this is open. I play many games that allow for multitasking, and this game's refusal to allow me to do so results in my investing far less time than I'd like into it. Really hoping the devs fix the issue so I can give this game the time it truly deserves."", ""UPDATE: 10/24/18 Game is really buggy. Glitches a lot. This game is so amazing!! As a long time Harvest Moon fan,since Nintendo 64 I've seen Harvest Moon change so many times. This game is so much better than seeds of memories that was released for Android and Apple. They put work into Light of Hope. The graphics are awesome, the controls are great! I'm so very pleased with Natsume. An hour in the game is the typical real life minute, you get to repair town buildings and find stone tablets to restore the town. I don't know why people are complaining about load time...it's the typical 5-10 second load time which is not bad at all, considering the graphics and work put into this game. I was let down by seeds of memories, but this game brought back my love for the long time Harvest Moon. You can marry, make friends, have kids, the same as any harvest Moon. It was so worth the $15. I hope to see character customization, maybe in a future update? I would love to get clothes and new hairstyles for the characters...but other than that I am totally happy with this game!"", 'I was only able to play the game for few days. Afterwards, I am stuck to seeing white screen when I launch the game. It just says ""Starting"" but I already waited for a long long long long time for it to actually start but it did not happen.

But i am very disappointed, why can't i play this game which i have paid in my other device? It is very inconvenient. I have bought HarvestMoon Seeds of Memories, but it is not like this. And now i have been thrown out of the game out of the blue, i haven't even saved it, sonit sucks. I'm using Samsung Galaxy Note5. Can you please fix this issue or at least give me some explanation for i have spent some money here. Thanks."", ""Well the game was so fun and just like harvest moon on PS 1 but why the time is not moving it's always showing 6:00am but the date is moving please fix this problem"", ""Its great other than the fishing which is fairly impossible on my current phone it seems (lg tribute of some kind), it glitches out to where the bar to fight the fish doesnt appear until you tap the screen and then if you tap too fast it doesnt count your taps so you cant reel in the fish which is how you progress past part of the story line. So basically i can't get further in the story of the game i just paid $15 for because of a bug. Please fix! Would be pretty awesome if i could play this without internet too because then id just start over on my tablet (which runs a bit smoother) and play on it instead, but its wifi only and I'm not trying to drain my entire hotspot in a couple of days because im having to play it via hotspot on my tablet to be able to progress at all. I really love harvest moon games and have been playing them for over a decade so im really saddened at this all happening."", 'Stuck on white loading screen, cannot use the game. Was obsessed for months and now I am kicked out!!! So disappointed. Does anyone know how to get a refund or better yet, fix it?', ""Game loads too long when going from farm to any part of town with that leafy green loading circle. This isn't graphics or cpu demanding unlike other games. MH Stories loads quicker than this. And that game has heavy graphics intensive processing going on and its still smooth on my phone. I recommend you optimize the game. Using an Asus Zenfone 5 2018. Thank you."", ""Garbage game. Nothing like the old Harvest Moon games. I emailed them about a refund. No reply.

Also without being a bag overflow some items harvested are being sucked directly into the dresser, and can at be removed. This is preventing me from completing quests. In addition since house upgrade and dresser/fridge use,I'm unable to purchase certain items from shops . For instance, pink dahlia seeds. Help!!!!please!!! Fix these glitches 🙏 I really want to play this game!!!"", ""I dont care how long loading so called takes I personally am thrilled this is on mobile! I am a huge fan of harvest moon games! Thank you so much for this! I do hope us phone users will get a chance to get updates to the game similar to dlc for pc and switch but if not I still thank you so much for putting this game on mobile! Not everything is able to afford huge gaming consoles etc so i'm super happy!"", 'Nice and simple. Just right for a phone game. The repair system could be more obvious. I had to click on buildings every which way before the menu popped up. I liked the movement controls in seeds of memories better. I do like that you went back to auto selecting tools and other actions though.', 'Love this game. Have not played a Harvest Moon game before but love Stardew Valley so I thought I would give this a try. I do prefer Stardew Valley over Harvest Moon but it is a nice change of pace. I play on my Chromebook with a mouse and it works flawlessly.

The only thing I hate about it is that I had to start all over because my phone wasn't working and I had to get a new phone.

The story was very intriguing. Hope more games like these will come out in the future!', ""I didn't expect to enjoy this game as much as I did. The story was interesting and it kept me intrigued to see what each mystery has to offer. It also had a nice balance between creepy and heartwarming. The characters, despite being quite basic, were easy to warm up to them and cheer them on. The BGM was also on point. One thing i have to complain about is the translation. Some of the word choices felt really awkward. Though, it didn't take away from the enjoyment and it's still understandable."", ""Developers did a great job with the plot and gameplay. I can't get over the ending though. Huhu why??? I loved it that they gave you the option to buy or watch ads for people who play for free."", 'I love this game so much! The characters seem too real to me and the stories are just all out wonderful! The first chapter started out as actually pretty terrifying, especially with the sound of that ghost girl\'s voice when she would say ""ANYONE IS OKAY"".

Thank you so much for making this game!', ""Oh, yes, it's such a great visual novel! I like every chapter (even though I kept getting bad ends all the time😅) and the whole story itself is awesome. I'd write more about my experience, but I don't want to spoil the plot for novice players. However, I will say that this app is 100% worth giving a shot, I'm sure you'll like it as much as I did!"", ""The art work is very cute and I find the characters adorable. The thing that I enjoyed the most is the background music I think it really sets the mood nicely (I got scared from chapter 1 ><) Overall the plot was great I like that the obvious choices aren't always the correct ones. It gives off a different vibe when you feel like only one choice leads to happy ending. The only thing that ruined it a bit for me is the translation it seemed a bit hard to understand especially at chapter 1."", ""A visual novel...THATS ACTUALLY FREE TO PLAY!! This was an amazing visual novel. The story was great, the characters were awesome, the animation was great, and itbwas definitely a great horror. I can't recommend this enough!"", ""This game is so good! I wish there would be another part for this, like an epilogue. What happened to Shino? What would it be like to have Akane as the Newspaper Club's president? So good!"", ""This is the first time I've played such a game. It was really fun. I liked the ending.it was touching and it took a while for me to complete the last chapter. I love the game and i hope you'll make more games."", 'Its really fun i love the differant endings and its just amazing for me its really fun ti do the voices the only thing i dont like is that you cannot get all of the last endings i understand why but i still dont like it when i have to restart the entire game to get the other game.', ""The novel is great. I loved the twist in the story and how much reliant the outcome is with the choices you make. Its a short novel but its been a rollercaster for me. Don't have much money to purchase it but I will instead support you with the ads. I will be looking forward for more games you guys produce."", ""I updated webview but it still doesn't work. I added a star rating so that I could add this comment. Edit: Now it works. Thanks I liked it. I wish it was longer."", 'This game is lovely! I had problems before but got fixed eventually. Keep it up!!!', ""I just finished the first chapter which fit the time of the month very well, it was spooky and i only got one bad ending though and that was fine but all in all it's really awesome and i do love me some visual novels i can fully enjoy plus i don't have to deal with ads when i don't have any cellular data so the pace isnt ruined in anyway possible. I beat the game and got 100% on it now the bonus mode i want to play but i don't have a way to pay for it. Also sequel pretty please."", 'So far I love it, they only show ads at specific times and always tell you when, the story is very interesting and the art is very good and a step above the rest', 'This game is awesome. The storyline a bit cliche but overall it is a good story. Hoping that you guys can developed more games like this one.', ""The story is really strict. It's either choose the right option and the story goes on, or choose the wrong option and the game fails and you have to restart from a check point. I mean, what's the point of having options when they don't mean or do anything. This game would have been better without the choosing part it just slows down the game"", ""This was a great game. The drawings were beautiful. The BGM was the best. The stories were interesting and the twist in the end was good and Akane senpai was so cute!!! I really loved this game and I'm waiting for more games like this from you...."", ""So this is a very fun game, because I've played it in the past ! But now I come and install it again today and have got up to The Girl In A Photo, Akane and Yuuki are at the park at night, I get the call from ??? but it never lets me proceed and I'm not sure what to do"", 'I really love this game it was fun but when I was playing in chapter 7 and Shino-senpai died I cried and when there was a new member I\'m just happy she almost look like Shino-senpai and there I said ""Shino-senpai you will always be in our hearts"" I\'m because I get to have the extra edition and I\'m also happy because there will be more Shino-senpai parts :). Thank you creator of this app :)', 'The Girl in the Photo was definitely my favorite... I think that should have gone to ""Day 6""... since after reading it, the others were good... but not as blood-chilling as that one. Still, amazing job! Keep it up!']"

Probably one of the more unique games out on the market right now. It looks to be pretty long as well. The whole gist of the game is you are a person who is transformed into a beast, and wants to protect this girl.

Neat little package im happy i took the time to finish', ""I'd say this is one of the best rpg I ever played. It's easy, but not too easy, perfect for someone who's not so skilled in games like me. The story has layers and is verh curious. I do not usually leave a review but honestly for this one I have to! Also I love it that it's offline and the recharges are so fast. Please keep doing good!"", ""This is genuinely, and surprisingly one incredibly fun game. The RPG mechanics have a fair bit of depth and the combat itself is incredibly fun too. I very much recommend this game, though I'd like more equipment slots to intensify the RPG aspect even more though."", 'I\'m really addicted. Can be played offline, have only ads that you decide to see, and a cute story. The grinding for having all items and having them at top lvl is well balanced with the envy to collect and the fun of the fast paced fights. No need to spend money at all to enjoy the game completely. You can really play at your own pace, without being stopped by waiting times or pushed to log on at precise times. I\'ve played maybe 14h or so and I really love how devs made it for us to appreciate playing, without feeling ""obligated"" to the game. I can too easily play until 2 am, because it\'s fun. The only thing I would like to be added is a way to pause the fights.', ""A great game. The story is sweet and has good pacing, and the battles are fun and continue to be enjoyable as you are able to change your character's abilities whenever you choose(and are rewarded for doing so!). It's also got a very nice monitization method. Choose to support the creator and avoid ads for just a few bucks, watch ads to let you keep going every now and again, or don't and spend a few minutes taking a break when your health gets low(or just buy more health with gold :p). It doesn't feel forced. It was a little meta to have the girl ask you to give a review, that's probably my only complaint. xD"", ""I Really like this game. It's simple enough to just pick up and play, but with enough depth to avoid becoming tedious. So far the story (while minimalistic.) is charming and interesting. The ads at the bottom of the screen annoyed me at first. But I realized it's Far better to have a small window at the bottom showing ads while I can still play uninterrupted, then those obnoxious games where it stops me during my gameplay to show an ad wen I just want to play. And the ads you can watch to get bonus stuff allow you to skip after 5 seconds and only start when I initiate them. Over all it's a fun a charming game if you aren't expecting a Final Fantasy, Fire Emblem, or some kind of AAA big budget game. Just a fun way to spend an hour or two of relaxing at a time."", ""Look, I played Brave Frontier for like two and a half years, so this is a little hard to say, but this and Soul Armor are my favorite app games. You really went in on these games. They are such a full package experience, it has the feel of a snes game with modern optimization and features and junk. These games really are something special. Thank you for making them. Also, anyone complaining about translation is an absolute nob. If you can't read broken English that means you're not very good at E"", ""One of the best mobile games I've played. I beat story mode, cleared the entire map, and have collected all the normal parts. I'm only missing three pieces of rare parts, the rare small animal to be specific. I've tried clearing all the spaces in the first area of the dream world, but haven't had any luck with drops. Do I have to master all the other parts in the game all the way to the rainbow star rank? I can't find any guides online, so a response from the developer would be appreciated. Thanks."", ""This is a great rpg not just on mobile but in general it's a good game. This game doesn't bug you to pay, watch ads, or even bring up pop ups which makes me want to gladly pay for it. The animations look a bit awkward on the map but in battles is where they shine, and the designs are creative within the limitations of 8-16bit graphics. The story is interesting and the character designs are pretty nice. I love this game and can't wait to see more from the developer of this game!"", 'A really good game. You can ""turtle"" and make steady progress or try to race out ahead. Both strategies can get you to the end of the game. The story is interesting and engaging. My one criticism would be that it needs better localization. The English dialog is pretty awkward and confusing, and there are some obvious errors with variable placement in strings (Kill some9 enemies, etc.). If ythe devs wanted help, I\'d even gladly volunteer. The story is good enough that it deserves a better translation!', ""Surprisingly fun game with some decent gameplay. So far ads are quite fair, with rewards. Can't say whether the story is good yet, but the fact it has one at all is a nice inclusion. Definitely worth giving it a shot if you're on the fence. [EDIT: The plot is good, but a lot of the nuances get lost in translation. Still scratching my head about who the subjects of half the conversations are)"", ""Cute and simple. The system of collecting parts to upgrade your character is simple to grasp but varied enough to keep things interesting, and the art and story keep me coming back. Battles are short so the game is a good pick up and play experience. I've almost completed the story (based on how much it the map I've uncovered) and am looking forward to completing my collection of parts."", ""I didn't expect to see innovation in a mobile game, yet here it is. The graphics are a bit rough around the edges and the mix between soft sprites and super pixely art is not amazing but the combat is just great! I've never seen something quite like it. The rest of the gameplay is pretty standard rpg stuff but thats fine and it's well done. Just try it. It's free anyway."", 'This game is very good, is a refreshing idea and is not a greedy machine. Try it and read the whole story, it is worthy. Now after the new patch you can actually see the end of the game, but it has an issue, the got stuck and you cannot progress to the whole content cause you need 1 more heart to open a memory, and that is just at the second part. Please fix this issue.', ""This game is absolutely amazing. I have utmost respect for a dev who chooses not to make ads totally obnoxious and intrusive, and I also love the level of customization that is b possible in this game. I am normally not a big fan of long grinds, but this hits that sweet spot where the grinding isn't too bad and still feels like work towards an end goal."", ""I only just got ten minutes into the game but I can already tell from the mechanics, gameplay and art that this is an amazing game. I've yet to see much of the story, but the innovative mechanics and beautiful art style is enough to keep me going for a long, long time. I can easily sink several hours into this game. This game is superb. I'm an amateur writer myself and while I haven't seen enough of the story to comment, I woukd love to see more work from you. Are you interested in a volunteer writing assistant?"", ""Absolutely love everything about this game. Minor English mistakes aside, this is such a beautifully crafted game, I just had to keep it around a bit longer. Lucky I did, otherwise I would've missed that update. No interruptive ads at all, fun and exciting combinations to make the strongest possible Chimera, and one innocent-looking story that I swear made someone cry. What more could one want?"", ""Gameplay is, well, different than other games I've played before. Storyline is pretty interesting So far, but the grind is pretty tedious. You need money for basically everything, and money's not that easy to come by. There's no sellable/farmable loot to speak of, so the only way to get money is to grind, grind, grind. If you can handle the grind, however, this is a pretty interesting game."", ""Great game. Interesting plot, interesting characters, and really straightforward mechanics. I found combos I liked but still cared enough to mix it up. Gold grind gets a little tedious and the dream world was kind of annoying since it's really difficult to get the parts there. My inner collector knew I'd waste way too much time for it to be viable. The ads are unintrusive and optional for the most part. I didn't even mind looking at them since it was my choice anyway."", ""Definitely one of the best I've played! I would love to see a more advanced 3D version of this (maybe more controlled gameplay)! There should be more mythical or monstrous parts! This game has so much potential! I feel that you should be able to upgrade or level up your individual parts with use. The dialogue and story could use some improvement. You can tell there's some translation errors too. Still good!"", ""Interesting concept for a game and at first, it was annoying me that i get an encounter every step but after realising the mechanics (u get to lvl every piece of item to mix and match your playstyle). storyline is quite mysterious and gets me to want to play more. another good thing is, it loads pretty fast and allows like a fast game here and there so i dont feel that i have to stay on the game just to keep up. Free to play but you can pay to reduce ads which so far has only appeared once. I'm very surprised its free to play."", 'I played through this game. The leveling up system seemed a little unnecessary and needlessly random, and lots of powers were completely useless, but the strategy was clear and the difficulty scaled well. The brightest gem was the story telling. It was sweet and endearing with a touch of melancholy. Great job devs,I look forward to more like it. Oh, and I was incredibly pleased with how ads were handled in this game. You can literally play this without seeing one full screen ad, but the rewards for choosing to watch an ad were fair.', ""Simple but engrossing little game. There's always something to keep leveling up, different part combinations to experiment with, and the concept of a chimera main character is cute. Most importantly, Chimera Recollect works well for both short or long play periods, which is vital for a mobile game. Ads are also all optional, which is a big plus."", 'Really cool game without needing to view ads everytime. I like the rpg feel to it and the simplicity. Choosing the parts to improve is somewhat tricky but it is not an unscalable wall. I wonder if you have items, consumables like potions? I thought it was the food but their effect is passive. More clarity with the stats, like how different one is from your current equip, could be an improvement.', 'This game is unexpectedly addicting. The gameplay is very unique and I enjoy wasting time playing this game. I do believe the ""manual"" could use a bit more info though. I have figured most of it out (i think) but I cant seem to figure out HOW to get a damage bonus. I have gotten miss, time, and skill but never once got damage. What am I missing? And no info about it ever. That, however, really is my only complaint.', 'Words do no justice... An epic story, which makes me cry, a haunting Prototype feel, (between the memory loss, the ability to shape shift into those you kill, and the winding story which is revealed piece by piece... but don\'t be mistaken, this is in no way a ripoff. It just gives me a nice feel of Deja vu.) I can\'t even begin to praise this. Though there are quite a few spelling errors (To the developer(s), I would be glad to volunteer my help in fixing them for you. I will send you an email for more on this matter.), the game is well worth these five stars... more even. This game is a beacon of what any game should aspire to be like: Original, Unique, With a great story, and memorable characters. A far cry from the boring, one dimensional clickers, stupid match three ""candy crush"" types, and the retarded and stupidly weird types, among the many other retarded games which get repeated over and over and over again just because almost nobody has the creativity to make anything original, or even unique. That said, there is only one word that can say anything about how legendary this is. Encore!', 'Cute graphics, fast-paced combat, and a ton of parts to collect and master. This is going to be my go-to game for quite some time. Free to play with ads, but for $0.99 you can turn those off, and the game is definitely worth more than a dollar. Do some free surveys online for Google play credit and buy yourself a game.', ""This game is totally awesome. When I pressed the button download.. I didn't expect something REALLY good. But this game changed my mind. Awesome soundtrack. Brilliant plot. Addictive gameplay.. This is the game one really have to try. By the way.. Developers created this game with love and they respect the players (at least it feels like that) and that means much I think."", ""Awsome game. A fresh take on a rpg genre with a battle mechanic different from other rpg games. It's fun and addictive to play. What is really interesting is the story. The more you progress, the more you know about what is happening around you, and each step gets more interesting. Overall, really fun game."", ""Amazing game! Love that it's not p2w or locked behind time gates. It's a real game, play as much as you want, whenever you want. Collecting all the animal parts and leveling up/exploring is really addictive. Combat is fast paced, controls are tight, and the graphics are pretty. Highly recommend!"", 'this game is fantastic. very unusual mechanics coupled with really engaging battles and equipment you constantly change and evolve and have massive differences between parts. Not p2w to the slightest. The only complaint I have is how slow text goes during dialogue but the story is at least 10 times better than 99% of other mobile games. Truly the developer had a lot of love for this project and it shows.', ""Very unique, and kind of hard to describe, but I'll try. A rogue-like, marble-like, bullet hell, brick breaker RPG. I think that about sums it up. The story is good, but the game continues long past that as you attempt to collect and master every body part. I have uncovered the whole map, collected all the collectibles, and finished the story, but I still get immense satisfaction from blowing monsters to pieces with my increasingly powerful and diverse array of skills. One of my favorites."", ""I really like this game, but I believe mine is somewhat glitched. I'm missing one if the arm/wing pieces and I've checked at least 10 times but there are no missing spaces behind where I am. I know it's not further into the story because I've already collected several rows worth of pieces after it. I believe it's the water arm, please help"", ""A decent time killer, for a few days. Ignoring text errors that didn't affect playability the main concern was a lack of explanation of abilities and how the game did eventually become repetitive around day 3 of playing. Fortunately, that was also when I finished story mode and had to choose between new game + or 100% grinding, and chose instead to recommend others enjoy it for what it is - a short lived and neat little time killer."", 'This game is great, the story is great even if the translation is a bit bad, but even with that its great. Btw, i think i found some kind of bug. The skill meteor from the ""sand"" body which cost 10 MP when fighting against the last boss somehow only cost 1 MP. I failed the boss fight, and when i try again, it become 10 MP again.', ""One of the most unique and interesting gameplay mechanics I've ever seen. Very fun and easy to kill time with."", 'Going square by square n having to fight on every square gets alittle repeatitive. But it is still enjoyable considering the smooth controls and different powers and avatar graphics that can be seen upon customization of body parts. I like the effort put into showing exactly how the avatar changes with the customization, that can be seen even on map. I will be patient to finish the game to see how it goes.']"

When I last updated for CNY, and then later for another one, I get a Christmas update, which was weird. Tsuki gets a mission from Nikolai to give Boba a present, but is unable to give said present. I decided to update the game for this new Feb update and the Christmas tree is gone, but the present remains. I guess I'll have to wait until Dec 2020 to try the mission again? I find it weird to see Xmas after the CNY event. A glitch?"", 'There seems to sometimes be a glitch when you interact with certain characters. In the Great City, if you agree to watch an ad for carrots when talking to the Insurance Guy, he disappears even though you\'ve said yes. Same with Eddie when you agree to listen to his story for cans. He says ""no deal, no garbage"" and disappears like you pressed no. This has happened several times now.', 'One thing is for sure; the game is relaxing. Art is just what I would want in a game like this. There are minor details in the game. The soundtrack are fabulous perhaps the main factor for such a relaxing feeling.

I look forward to what else I will encounter and also try to remember to not hurry and take life slowly, enjoying the little things. Hopefully in real life too."", ""love it!! Update on 13 02 2020 I still love the game I didn't not open the game for a while. When I started playing the game again it surprised me as they have added more places to go, more shops and characters interactions etc. Music is very calming, good graphics, cute and detail design for the houses."", ""This game is great. It doesn't make you play, it really is a game you can just leave running, as well as it doesn't force ads onto you. I left it for a month and one of the npcs noticed, but after that everything went back to normal. They do have ways to buy carrots, (the currency in the game,) but it is not forced on you like in some games. This game is awesome, and very relaxing. I love it."", ""Really cute and calming game. There's nothing you HAVE to do which is nice, but there is the chance to unlock diary entries by trying out buying different items and playing the game at different times of the day. The option to watch ads for extra carrots, but you can just ignore those characters."", 'The rabbit is so cute.

It's a very relaxing experience, and doesn't require a lot of effort. Progression is slow, which is both its strength and weakness, as many games got us used on much faster progression... But honestly this suits perfectly with this game! Can't wait to see how it goes!"", ""It's a good and chill game, what more can one say really? It's quite difficult to express the feeling of calm and relaxing atmosphere that you get from playing this game so I highly reccommend you experience it yourself first-hand instead of having to rely on these reviews. Trust me, ya won't regret it!"", ""I love the game but it takes too long to earn carrots to advance and the events are very buggy. Too much frustration for a casual game. The concept and story are fun, though, and there is a lot of potential. I'd like to see them support this game enough to remove blaringly bad and obvious event bugs and provide prompt technical support, as well as ways to earn carrots faster than fishing and watching ads. I find myself losing interest in the game."", ""It's an adorable chill idle game. I've been playing it for a while (before Dawn came into the game) and the developers have added a wonderful amount of things to make it more fun/achieve more goals in the game. :) Just as a suggestion, if the stores could refresh their items faster than the amount we receive carrots, or buy multiples of one item or food (ex. carrot chips, cup noodles, etc) that would be nice, especially when we're at the forest."", ""Tsuki is a cute game with cool graphics, places and characters. It is unique, easy-going and a great way to take a 5 minute break. The only drawback is that you have to pay real money to join the Moon Club. There is no way to earn a membership through gameplay. It's a bummer because, if you're like me and don't spend money on games, you'll hit the limit to what you can explore. There are also bugs. Pipi doesn't know she's to receive a gift from Santa. Tsuki could become a great game one day."", ""For you all who's been wondering why pipi can't accept the xmas gift, just go to the tranquil garden (using kite/ bug catcher) and you will find her playing in the pile of snow next to the stone chairs.

And for the last update , there is a little bug because at Chi's, Mori's house, and the mermaid coast have no snow at all 😂 not a big problem tough. Thanks for creating this game!"", ""A very fun game, I don't recommend it for anyone 8 or younger or those wanting a fast paced or specific objective game. I love collecting toys, wallpaper, season-specific items, carrots, and store bought items. Collecting things in the game, making almost all characters hearts blue, and getting diary entries makes me feel mildly accomplished and gives me something to do in the game. I fish with the fishing rod to make money/carrots."", ""Tsuki is a really cute game about a rabbit and a carrot farm. It's really calming and a pretty neat and clean game. The only thing you need to pay for is the dream suite, but it in no way is a vital part of the game and can easily ignored or forgotten. I recommend it to those looking for a good idle game with plenty of charm."", ""It is a great game every thing is very cute in it and I like how they even made a train and tickets to go from one place to another.But when you are travelling you can't really do anything I mean like they can give us a peak inside the train and all like they did with all the other things. But overall it's a great game and you should totally download it.🙂"", ""The graphics are very adorable and relaxing. I love that when i go back, tsuki will be doing something on their own. V nice, idle game. But i just hope thatbthere's something that the users can do to boost/gain more carrots, like some job or smth. But v cool story :>"", ""cute game, relaxing, no timer counting down. just pick up carrots when you can. the cartoon look is adorable. *edit* Ran into a problem during the Christmas event, sent an email to the devs and received no response. I bought a ticket to the snowy village and within a few hours Tsuki was sent home; I couldn't finish helping Santa. Then I decided to go camping, got to the gas station and paid for gas; when I checked in again later Tsuki was back in the Mushroom Village. Please fix this."", ""More tedious than calming. Characters are always too busy to talk to you and you can barely do anything until you have carrots. The only way to get loads to carrots is to play more exiting games than this one through the links they give... At least link more idle games. It's what your audience clearly likes since they're playing this. The area you can go on the map is really limited, so I couldn't just explore peacefully by myself. It's not as adventure at all."", 'It\'s a great game to pass the time, and they add a lot of new events. But it\'s hard to collect carrots because it often doesn\'t even let me watch the ads whether I click yes or no. I hope this error can be fixed :""(', 'I need help. whenever I tap on a building, the thing that pops up is small, its usually big.', ""Tsuki is a beautiful, cute, fun, casual game.

Like let you decide when you want to go back home on the blimp."", 'The graphics are so cute and the gameplay is simple and relaxing. This game is perfect for those who are busy and are able to check in every now and then.

Sometimes I won't be able to sleep and I'll open the app to find that Tsuki is awake and looking at the stars. It makes me feel less alone. I highly recommend it to anyone who would like a friendly fox to fish with."", ""My save is broken. It's been 11 days and Dawn's workshop and the train station are always closed.

You don't need a lot of dedication/time just check in every now and again.

I also completed the free carrots, and haven't been able to get a reply from the developers."", ""It's actual super simple and enjoyable. I like that if I don't log in for a day or two, nothing is wrong and the day counter continues. I wish there were more things to do at night, or click on, as I'm active at night more often than during the day."", ""Didn't think I'd like it at first but now I'm totally hooked. Love Tsuki so much, he's so cute!! The only thing I wish they would add a fish album so that you could keep track of all the fish you catch!"", ""Great game, only complaint is that I started the three day trail only to cancel it after realizing I don't need it to play. I can still ride the club moon blimp I'm not sure if it's a glitch or if I'm still being charged for it."", 'I have only played for two days so far and I love it!! The reason why I did not rate 5 stars is because the fishing mechanic is not what I had hoped for. It does not give you enough time to notice the exclamation icon when a fish is ready to catch.']"
Sherlock Pro,com.kaser.sherlockpro,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kaser.sherlockpro&hl=en&gl=us,"Sherlock is a computerized version of logic puzzles, where you're presented with a series of clues that help you to determine the exact locations of all of the images on the playing board. The puzzles are all 4x4, 5x5 or 6x6.  Each row of the playing board contains images of the same type (faces, houses, numbers, fruit, street signs, letters, etc). The game scrambles the locations of the items in each row (without showing you their locations) and then presents to you a set of graphical clues that describe the positional relationships of different images. You use the clues to deduce where things can't be (and where they HAVE to be) until you know where all of the images are located.

- minor bugs fixed.","[""Love this game! But sometimes when I click to get the hidden steak, after the ad it doesn't give me the steak. So I do it again. It didn't give me the steak. I have to go back into the app again. Can you please fix it? I don't like the fact I keep watching ads only to not get the steak, which is what I hoped for."", 'Very nice time passing game, check up on every now & again to collect and play for a few moment & go back to collecting as time passes I prefer games ""without"" in app purchases & on line access for world pvp & other unnecessary things, no need to make every game like that in my opinion <(^^,)> I like this little game', ""I love this. It's charming and adorable. I'd love to be able to grind old maps though. And sometimes I gotta sit through normal ads right after I sit through an ad for a bonus. Fix that, 5 stars!"", ""I'm not a LoL player, so I'm probably not in the intended audience, but this game was kind of directionless. The art and animation was pretty poor and there just didn't seem to be a point to continue, no stages or rewards, just more of the same: a few enemy waves, 4 skills to juggle and no feeling of progress."", 'Very fun. I love the cute art style and the little card things. On stage 11 and its already getting a bit challenging, but not too much that you would need to grind. The music is nice too.', ""I've only encountered a one bug, and it wasn't game breaking. Sometimes when loading in, it'll tell you the amount of money earned while offline, and then it doesn't actually give you the money. However, I've always just been able to reload to get the money. Apart from that, it's great. Super cute, addicting, and when it starts to get old or grindey, you can just stop and come back when it won't be old or you've got tons of money saved up. Plus, the treats make leveling really easy."", ""The gameplay is a bit repetitive, but it changes just enough to not be boring. The art is adorable and I dont feel like I'm hitting a plateau. The ad rewards are also very fair, helping progress quite a bit. Any ads I didn't choose to watch have only been 5 seconds, which I really appreciate. I definitely suggest this, even if you just use it to kill time"", 'Its an easy and adorable game. Minimal investment on yourself, but can be as active as you want. Would highly recommend for anyone that enjoys Ahri and Poro from LoL and looking for a simple time waster when waiting around.', 'Allow us to choose background music for each stage for more enjoyable experience, game is so good as it is loaded with cuteness, also please let us download cute Ahri ability cards we had to choose in HD. I wanna set some of them as my home screen pic on my phone, especially the Ahri\'s ""Me go sleep""', ""It's so cute, while playing this game I tend to talk in a high pitch voice to match the character. But this is super fun and I love it >w<"", ""There are some really cool aspects, but the combat can get sort of repetitive after a few hours. The best part of the game tbh is the graphics. Ahri is depicted in many different outfits and situations, and they're all so adorable that you want to keep playing just to see them all."", 'This game is really nice. The game is easy. You can become op fast if you save up your in game coin. The cards are designed well. The changed in thw charaters skin or design is nice. I give this game 5 stars for great design, game play, and easyness.', ""Very fun and surprisingly addicting.. my only complaint is the long stock cooldown on skills but can't make it too easy right?"", ""I keep getting kicked out of the game over and over when I tap the portal thing to get the Poro back at the beginning. not sure how you may be able to fix it but please do this game looks like so much fun and it's really disappointing that I can't even play it"", 'Noice.. idk at 1st why people rate it so good but when i try it its kinda fun. Its got a cute little fox girl and cute thing names poro. The control and the stages are good. Easy control and challenging stages. Highly recommend this game if u wanted something casual and cute.', ""Addictive idle-like RPG. Zero F2P content and watching 30 second ads make huge differences. It's very fun!"", ""This is the cutest game I have ever played and no one can change my mind, it's a good game to play when you got free time to spend, for example being in the bus"", 'Pretty sweet game. Entertaining and fun, and the cards are very cutely drawn.', ""Great game! I've been playing it for a few hours, and while not really obeying the optimal flow chart, it's really fun to pick up and play anytime!"", 'Super cute casual game. Some idle rpg elements, great to pick up and play a few minutes at a time. The art is charming and adorable, ads are minimal.', 'It\'s almost an idle game, poros give a small amount of gold income for 30 minutes. This is boosted by feeding them a poro snack, wait 30 minutes or watch an ad to get one. The ""game"" is a short dash against enemy minions using Ahris 4 abilities. It\'s fun the first few times but after a dozen or more of the same, being fed ads again and again, it just stops feeling entertaining.', ""Really relaxing and chill to play, the music is probably my favourite part, each track sounds vaguely familiar and nostalgic and there's lots of variety"", ""Gameplay is very simple, and I think it's just an adorable little game"", 'I really love this game! Its very simple game but very addicting! I love kitsune so much! Thank you for making this game! 😍😘😘😘', ""I barely got the app and I'm already in love! it's fun the adds are... ok. And it's overall an ok game. So I'm giving it a 3 and 1/2 star rating but there's no halves I give it 3 :( sorry"", 'Its a very fun game with cute art. Its perfect for killing some time. I like how te ads are really rewarding. Recomended', ""It's a casual addictive game to play between breaks. It's pretty great."", ""I've only had the game for less than a day and its really enjoyable, the upgrades and the gameplay. Its to play easy but does require some small amount of strategy, would recommend this. The music suits and is nice with gameplay and the graphics match the games overall feeling to it."", ""I personally love this game and the other ahri rift game. simple, fun, and cute. like very cute. I like this game since your not super powerful so you gotta use your abilities wisely and plus the little poro farm. I kinda hope you guys make another ahri game or add more stuff like more skins and more, like the kda skin. heck i'd pay for a cool skin or another game. a multiplayer mode would be cool but I doubt that'll happen. still though cool game 10/10. ps plz more updates"", ""The game is really fun! It doesn't push ads through a premium currency, but it does show you them."", ""Absolutely adorable. Its designs are cute and controls are incredibly simple. My only issue is that there isn't much to do."", 'Very enjoyable. I like that every level you gain you can get a special power. Makes you want to play more. :)', ""This game's decent. I don't really play LOL, (I think that's where the character's from) but it's convenient."", 'A quite fun game to waste your time on bus or in toilet, cute music and even cuter animations even if you arent a big leauge of legends fan this game is actually entertaining', 'Its a really fun game to play. I usually play it when I have down time at work!', 'Cute game. Miss storyline to have it feel like a game rather than mindless grind.', 'So unsually game, but i like it. Easy control and easy play', 'Absolutely adorable, challenging enough to keep you going but not terribly, and cute mc!!!', 'Fun and cute game, no in app purchases and ads are far in between, love it', 'Pretty fun to play. Some UI issues but overall good game!']"

Well, no, actually it was just a bunch of silly-looking monsters suddenly causing trouble. Anyway, someone's got to teach them a lesson, and that's you!

Help out the townsfolk and they'll let you take charge of their town, building it as you like. Plus, you get to be a respected hero. Some get their treasure from quests. Some get items and money from managing a town. But why not both?!

Create a party of characters with different Classes, like Knight or Beast Tamer. Have pet monsters fight alongside. Choose your weapons and armor based on the elemental affinity of your foes to hit hard while taking less damage yourself.

You can do it all in style, as there are lots of outfits for you to choose. And if you think looking human is boring, no problem! Wear a dragon, cat, dog, or fox costume. No one's going to judge you! Show off your cool character at the Online Plaza, and maybe even quest together with another player.

Embark on an epic yet laid-back adventure in this town-building RPG. It's fun whether your priority is to save the world or get a stylish hat.

Energy limitations and microtransactions are the bane of mobile gaming, but they make a lot of money for game developers and publishers unfortunately.

The controls to view the farm and and move your character are a little funny, but everything else makes up for it. The ticket system, coin system, weapons, outfits, upgrading/leveling up, etc. The ads aren't even annoying. They pop up every so often but doesn't interfere with gameplay.

• Bugfixes","[""It's a good app, but there are many things that need fixing. The calendar looks super boring compared to all the other tabs, no icons for the items recommended, or links to the said item including the info about it. I'm basically saying it feels dull to read and look at. And there's a search bar to search for information on items, but there's literally no information and just a link to the wiki. If it weren't for those things, this app would be the best Stardew Valley assistant on here."", ""A great little planner app for SV. I downloaded a couple of others and this one is definitely the best. It's 100% worth paying for. I like the clean interface and neatly organized info about people/items. Some reviewers complained about the way that certain items don't have full info and only offer a link to the wiki, but I haven't minded that. I'm just having patience and hoping the dev integrates more information through updates."", ""Not bad. Really helpful when trying to get to a steady place in the game quickly, especially with the community center. I don't mind going in the wiki for some things since it's more detailed (would like the option on every object and character, though), but disappointed there's no easy way to make reminders for crops or animals."", ""It's a nice app, very smooth UI, and the villager's schedule feature and daily reminders are great. But I think it should have more info per item to be worth spending $1, such as: recipes the item is in, if its loved by anyone, etc. Right now a lot of items just link directly to the Wiki. Overall though I am happy with it. Just disappointed it doesn't have more information."", ""I love this app! I started a new game after the recent updates and decided to try this out. It has almost everything I want! I know some people are complaining there's not enough content so there's wiki links instead, but the developer took the time to make sure the link takes you to the exact page, which I really appreciate. I've never had a question I couldn't find the answer to! 100% recommend!"", ""It would be really nice if there was a rarecrow checklist, recipe checklist & if more info was given. Such as about the ponds or mines, different areas, monsters you may encounter and events. Otherwise, I feel as though it's really handy to have and it's worth the money."", ""It's a really good app! It's such a helpful tool! It has trackers for the community centre, a really awesome calender that tells you everything you need to know, when events are on, when people's burthdays are and when you can plant things (towards the end of the season). It also has all the Nov information you need. Honestly, I was reluctant to pay for it, but it was the best decision I made! Well done guys, it's very helpful :D"", ""Simple. Useful. Just wish it synced with the wiki already. I thought it was a year but it was really 3 months. I dunno what I saw before. Anywho, other than that, I'm pretty happy with the app. Def worth paying for once the wiki is synced. Or if it's just filling in info I wouldn't mind helping!"", 'I love this app. It is so incredibly helpful when trying to schedule my day in game! I do recommend adding an ""Enemies"" tab in the search section. You could break down the levels they belong in the mines and the possible loot they could drop as well!', ""This is an excellent guide, most guides just have links to the main wiki, and the whole point of a guide is to have offline use. This guide has almost everything with links to the wiki only appearing on the specifics of new features. I really enjoy the checklist feature for the community center. Another excellent feature is the daily task feature that tells you when the last day to plant a specific plant is or to check the traveling cart. Overall the best gaming guide I've ever seen."", ""I've tried a lot of Stardew Valley assistant apps, but this one sets the standard for the others. It had everything I need, it's simply incredible. And what always earns my satisfaction is a GREAT implementation of Material Design, that even follows Android 10's system themes! I think the only thing that's needed is the removal of redirects to the wiki and instead include that info in-app. So worth the money, you could charge $5 for this and I'd do it. Absolutely awesome, excellent work! 👌"", ""It's a very solid app. I think the next direction is having the recipes for dishes down. Also I wish they brought back the villager tab. I dont like having to go to the search tab. Now, if only they included a carpenter shop tab..."", 'I started playing Stardew again on the Switch with the 1.4 update and this app has been amazing! It makes things so much easier then when I tried to have the wiki open in like 10 tabs on my phone. I can understand how some people would be annoyed with all the info not being on the page but it always links to the wiki in one click without having to do the search yourself. Great app and makes my experience with the game so much better. Thank you for your hard work! Definitely worth the purchase!', ""I'm amazed 😯 this is app is way better than expected! This is very useful to organize and track other NPC's (Non-Player Character) in the game, and very useful if you need to find a certain items in game. Will be definitely using this for a while and can't wait for new updates down the road!"", 'Update: Not sure the gift lists are accurate. I gave someone something from the ""likes all"" list and they didn\'t like it (it wasn\'t an \'except\' item) ***Also a to-do list would be great!!!*** Only just got the app but I LOVE that it has a Community Center checklist! I made my own the other day but I\'ll definitely be using this one instead! Also highly appreciate having character profiles all in one spot! I\'m glad the creator is responding to feedback as well', ""Almost all you need! Calendar 10/10 The calendar is for me the best feature. The most complete part is the schedule, it's amazing and 98% accurate. I was hoping for a offline wiki, but all the links point you directly to the wiki you need so i think is ok! Regret nothing"", 'The app is really great but please add the checklist option for tasks and the missing infos(about items) As Soon As Possible. I just picked up the game from steam. When is your next update coming? edit : Thanks for adding the checklist option and strike through. This is the best assistant for stardew valley', 'I always have this app open when playing Stardew Valley on my switch. You can add your own tasks to each day as well as track what you should be adding to the community center or even the museum. Its minimalistic and powerful. This is a must have for new players.', ""This app is great. While I don't think it's finished yet (quite a few items just have a link to the stardew valley wiki) the calendar is fantastic, and the Villager schedules are amazing! Once more of the items are directly on this app instead of simply having links, it's a 5 star app for sure."", ""This is my fav SDV tracker - it's super clean, can track multiple farms, and includes tasks options, birthday/event/crop planting reminders, and even a list of villager's likes and schedules. It also has the most well organized bundles/museum checklist of any SDV apps I've tried. There is no info on building material or extra crop info but it runs so smooth that it is easy to use and has no ads! Use this tracker and the SDV Wiki page to make building your farm easy peasy!"", 'Great app with all you need in one place. I used to visit the Stardew wiki constantly but this is much quicker and easier to access. There are some pages that are not complete but the direct links to the wiki are very convenient. Worth the money!', 'Really handy app. Great that its offline so can use on the train. There is still a fair amount of info missing though. You have to go to the wiki for it. So drop one star for that. But I like the all overall, the calendar is really good.', ""Missing a ton of information, the app directs you to the free online wiki when it's missing even basic content. Why do I need a paid app to link me to someone elses work at the online wiki? I'll consider changing my review when the app is actually done, so far it seems like I donated to a $1 Kickstarter."", 'Would love to see something for tracking the adventure guild. Otherwise it has everything you need and is beautifully designed. This app does link to the wiki often, but new data is being actively put in and I would rather a link to the wiki then incorrect or missing info.', ""A great guide! It Allows you to create reminders for yourself. It Notifies you of every in game Event from festivals to when the traveling cart passes through.It even let's you know the best day to plant Crops! There are also helpful Links to the Stardew wiki."", ""Excellent tool for Stardew Valley. Much easier to use than constantly traversing the wiki. I have encountered some ANRs and a few crashes but it's very rare and not blocking. Would love to have a Fall Fair list of points as well, but overall excellent app. Well done."", 'Extremely helpful and well worth a dollar. Clean layout, easy to use, and saves me a ridiculous amount of trawling through the wiki. Very nice!', ""I'm having a good time with this app. Skeptical about the 99 cent price tag, but it works nice. The interface is clean, the calendar is the most useful part for me. My one wish to improve the app is to add where to get items."", ""I love this app a lot and use it every time I play, and I haven't had any problems with it. However, I'd think it'd be complete if there were a way to put when you plant your crops & have them show up on the main screen when they're gonna be ready to harvest. Otherwise, great job!"", ""Great app with lots of information. When info is missing, it links back to the wiki which is a great idea (that's where you'll end up anyway!). I hope the dev continues to add stuff, would love to see quest info."", 'So valuable for the community center bundle checklist. Not all wiki items are in yet, but the dev is constantly working, and there are links in the app for your browser. Really nice ui, too.', 'I like how its organized but it does not have info for many items inside the app. It just links you to the wiki. Itd be a great stel if they had the info in the app itself. Especially because its paid.', ""For a paid app, I expected the search function to have more items. Or at least links to the wiki until it's updated. Edit for reply (search large pack or backpack, nothing comes up, not even a link, but it does in the wiki) it is an item. Like the pickaxe, I'd like to search information about it but it's not there."", 'Very simple and neat, just wish there was more available info, even though there are links to the wiki. For one dollar and no ads I have no real complaints. Thank you for creating this.', 'This app is great. The interface is easy to use and isnt clunky. It looks nice and doesnt have incorrect information. I especially like that you can keep track of your bundles and that it tells you when things like the traveling cart are happening.', ""So convenient! This is awesome in helping day to day. I'm able to get new recipes, getting all the birthdays and much more from the daily info. Love it"", 'I am expecting this guide is more likely Stardew Valley Wiki, yet it has a lot of missing information and suggest us to open SV Wiki, what for we pay like $1 just to get suggestion to open SV Wiki? Please add more information, quests, events, and etc.', ""It's very helpful to me while I play. And theirs a button you can press to go to the wiki. Question for the future. Are you planning to do heart events too? Because my phone isn't always connected to the internet and I don't want to accidentally miss any. Other than that I really like this game!"", ""Extremely handy tool that I use for each of my Stardew Valley plays! It shows me what to expect of the day and reminds me of everybody's birthday and also make sure I dont forget when the traders are in town!"", ""It's a great help with managing relationships and bundle completion. I love having it available, especially if I'm playing on console or mobile where I don't have mods available.""]"

The crafted items and machines are bloated and it's a constant problem having space. Many features are not useful or fun or abandoned. The events are not worth the effort for the prizes awarded..REGRET 100%"", 'Developers ruined a great game. I have played this game for over 2 years and it has been great until a few months ago.

Sadly I can't get the money back or my time wasted ."", 'I wish I could give no stars. With the latest update it is all about them making money off of us. It went from being totally awesome to totally disappointing. There is almost no way to upgrade. At the end of the Jolly competition you usually get things to upgrade your barn and silo and other things. They added almost double tasks which some of our community completed easily only to get to the prizes and find chicken feed and things you already have in your barn or could easily make. Sad!!!', 'Until the last lot of upgrades i would give a 5,beings golden farm have made it more than impossible to upgrade or move along in the game unless spend huge amount of money to buy gems .

This was the only game i played daily & i loved my team! We are all leaving the game since the latest update has ruined it. Tasks are extremely difficult with teeny tiny rewards.

I'm sad it's gotten this bad this quick & will be uninstalling."", ""In 2 days our group has lost 3 players. This game isn't fun anymore since you have changed everything. You will keep losing players. I dont want your automated letter to contact you. I want results or you lose a lot more players. I hope others read this before they download it.

Boils down to spend real money or dont play your game."", 'I really like this game but recently the updates are not the best. They took the possibility of getting the free diamonds daily, also the gifts you get now are not as useful ( I wish I could still get items to upgrade my farm).

This is definitely becoming a little stressful.', 'This was the best farm game I have played. However recent changes have made it very disheartening and most of my community has quit playing.

Now it drops out every time it goes to play an ad. Like when it opens and asks if you want to double up, playing ads to cut down a tree, playing ads to get gifts at the ""movies"".

I do have a few suggestions that would make it better for the player. -I would love to be able to purchase useful things like saws with coins instead of gems.

Internet is fast and yet it shows, error in network connection!! If you cannot take honest feedback, god help you then!!!!"", ""I love this game for many reasons. I played paradise bay for years and this is very similar only packed with more surprises. I gave it 4 stars because like most things, it's not perfect. I love the special events but I feel they overlap too much and one initially starts out with a fairly crowded island causing me to have had to move things multiple times to get it all to fit. I like my island nice and tidy. Over all it's a great game.""]"

They give you 50 energies to use but when your cutting down a tree that\'s 45, it simply does not give you enough to continually play the game beyond one minute.

For example hunting, takes a ton of energy and after you shoot the bear/deer you get 1 maybe 2 hunks of meat which only gives you 15 energy each, far from the amount it took to shoot it. Unnecessary challenge that I'm sure is just to get you to spend money on the game. But that would be a waste too cause you burn the energy so fast. *Edit Thanks for the really personal copy paste response. 🙄 *"", ""I really like the game and the concept but it takes too much energy to do anything, I wait an hour for full energy and it's only enough to cut down one tree or resource, I can't achieve any side missions as they use energy too. Even if I did fall into the trap of buying energy you really don't get much for your money it's used up too quick. 90 energy on 1 tree makes the game frustrating and slow. If the developers need money put adds in or something do the game is playable as it is a good game."", 'Enjoyable but its rediculous how little energy they allow you when it takes so much energy to clear paths and do things, they want you to buy energy of course to make up for it but really the bar is way too small... I am editing my review. This game has the worst and rudest customer service I have ever experienced in a game. I deleted the game and I suggest finding a new game by totally different developers. Not even remotely worth the 5 bucks I spent on it.', ""I really could love to enjoy this game, however it's has many hickups. It takes way to long to rebuild enough energy to continue the different obstacles, being that the main way to excel is by removing scrubbage and completing different tasks. I'm not fund of the idea when you purchase farm animals or plots to plow, after a period of time, you have to repurchase them, because they 've mysteriously disappeared. Overall, I believe this game could really be good, just need some re-tweaking."", ""Kept seeing an ad where you have to feed sheep in a pen without letting a wolf get them. That is NOT what this game is. I'm so sick of ads that show nothing of what the game really is. This is a settlement game where you complete tasks for rewards. Grow and harvest beans. Then sell them to make money so you can build a sawmill. No thanks. I want something to challenge my mind. This is just boring and false advertising."", 'The game isnt at all like its advertised. I\'m on chapter 2 town 7, dont get me wrong this is a great game and very addictive, so many things to do in the game.... I think I\'m just getting a little bored of it now. Its slot of energy bars to clear the towns (which you wait for) and get 1 every couple of mins.... I guess after a while of waiting I just lose interest. Be careful though as it is addictive and you will spend money haha. Theres little 7 day pop up "" adventure towns"" their pretty neat.', ""I have liked playing this. It's fun and challenging with a variety of activities. The thought needed to progress and grow is nice. But, it will keep you from progressing like needed by limiting the 3 item needed to move forward unless your willing to $, energy, gems, and resources. Energy takes too long to accrue, resources and gems are scarce. Time to generate these is ridiculous and things are dependent on time, resources and money to make items. The frustration will probably end me playing."", 'Basically two games in one, seemingly unrelated to one another, and both are dull. The first is a town builder/farming type affair. Farm to make produce to make money to buy bigger farm equipment to farm more. The second is a bush-bashing clear the path to venture forth thing, which is clearly made as a money grab unless you have the patience of a saint as the cost to clear anything is totally out of balance with how much energy you have. Events are no different. Unoriginal and boring. Avoid.', ""Great game but when you make in-game purchases, you don't get much. takes to much energy to clear lands. fun game but way too costly to progress. Great graphics, storyline, and balance would be good if it didn't take so much energy to clear lands. Orders from other boards take too much to complete. Saws, hammers are nearly impossible to obtain."", 'Ok.. I have played many of these type games. This one is sooo out of balance. The energy spent to progess is ridiculous. You earn 1 energy point for each successful level. The order board... After the first few levels they request only green house poduce. You get 4 plots in each green house. The requests will be high in number. Such as 30 plus. Because of this earning coins is challenging. The shipping requests... A joke. I gave this game 1 star for effort.', ""The game is fine, but it's literally nothing like the advertisements. I should have read the reviews first. I have no interest in games like this one, and wanted to play the game that was advertised, which appeared to be a strategy based, problem solving game. This is just another Farmville experience. I'm not sure why it is advertised the way that it is, to a completely different genre of people. If you advertised it to the right demographic, you'd get people that actually wanted to play it."", 'This game is not like the preview with the wolves and the sheep. You have to go in every hour just to uncover the clouds to get you quest done. Barely get green gems which you need in order to recieve lightning to play. It only goes up to like 60 if your not playing. I like the game except not being able to continuously play unless you pay cash. I cant keep doing that just to play a game..', 'Great fun. Energy big downside. Interesting game, lots of elements to keep a player engaged. Energy generated per hour 40. Plus 20 more if you have mint tea. More can come from defunct farm animals and foraged food. Unfortunately even 100 energy points equals about 5 seconds play. More can be bought but too expensive. Eventually this is what will cause me to delete game. Shame because all else is such fun', ""I like the concept that the source of what is needed comes from rocks, or precious stones found in rocks to trade, gold nuggets to trade, products from the land and animals to create food to sell for an income to buy another choice to make more income. There is so many positives to this working game, it's a great teaching game too. The only negative I have is that the energy bar gets wipe out too easily, nor do I think it's fair to have to share the energy with side prize games."", 'Enjoying the game, playing at my own pace. It takes quite a long time to gain your ""energy points""..I would change this feature. For those who are new to the game, try to clear everything before going on to the next location as you will find things to increase your energy. If you can, get the ""Hotel"" as it gives you 50 extra workers. Also, I have 30 ""feed"" for each kind of farm animal in my ""bag"". I hope this helps the newcomers in the game. Cupid Park was GREAT!', 'False advertising. Nothing like ad shows. Not a ""pin-pull"" puzzle game. Just a farmville knockoff. And the responses to others\' complaints on this issue are met with claims that the misleading ads are showing game from another view? Only if that view is complete hallucination. No. This did not meet expectations of anyone who saw the misleading ad. 0-stars', ""Too much energy needed to clear things and not a big enough energy bank. I play for 1 minute and have only chopped down 1 tree and I'm already out of energy. I don't mind spending a few dollars on a game but this is a pay as you go type game unfortunately. I really wanted to give this a higher rating because I do love the concept of the game."", 'Modern apps seem to have a trend where they advertise for an app that has nothing to do with their game. The creators must think that their app is so bad that they have to show off a game that doesn\'t exist to get people to download it. And when people complain about the false advertisement they just respond with something stupid like ""oh, were trying to make out adds interesting"" They are basically saying ""our app is so bad were advertising something that has nothing to do with our app.', ""Fun, but energy is frustrating & makes people quit. I've over a million coins but can't buy energy with it. Change that; people would play. The game is quite buggy. Mine shuts off for no reason, the queues and feed come up blank. The MOST important suggestion: Please, at higher levels, more important buildings and animals should be available. Giving no real goals (except coins which could buy only decorations & not the factories I need) is not satisfying. Improve and get more stars!"", ""Great game but frustrating that you dont get enough energy to do anything. Most of the tasks take 100's of energy but you can only acccumulate a very small amount at a time so can only play in short bursts. Due to this it doesnt keep you engaged. The energy accumulation needs to be increased at each level, even if only by 10. You can make energy but you need to have energy to collect the things needed to make it, good as an extra but not enough."", 'This game is fun and addictive, but you can not play without spending quite a bit of $$$. There are certain essential things you need that can only be bought. You have to buy workers to run everything after you spend tons of money and time setting up dairies, bakeries, glass blowing, factories, and more things needed to produce products to sell. When you run out of natural resources there is a research facility to make anything you need, but it takes 45 minutes & often comes up short.', ""I love this game.. But its obnoxious to come in and out of the game constantly because energy is not accessible enough. To actually play the game and enjoy it, you have to spend somewhere around $25 a week and that's not in anyone's budget. Disappointing that a very well thought out game with great graphic and story is so hard to play."", ""The game has potential, but it is definitely a pay to play game. Don't download this game if you don't want to spend a large amount of money to have enough energy to play efficiently. Responses to other reviews say you have to use strategy to decide what to spend your energy on. This is not true. If you want to progress in the game you have to use energy. With 50 energy you can clear maybe 5 feet in game before you are spent and have to buy more or wait a long time before you can continue."", ""Too bad you don't get extra energy for completing tasks. The energy goes way too fast and if you don't want to spend money, you do a lot of waiting for refills. It is also set that energy stops refilling at 53 and that goes quick. It would be better to have energy build higher or at the very least require less to do tasks."", 'At first the game was nice to play but increasingly becomes more difficult to progress. Building, energy use, time to create items. Many ways to make energy but its spent faster than made. Or second options - Pay real cash. I spend real money and feel RIPPED OFF. 45 gems = 500 Energy. I stopped counting after the 14th time it** happened. **Spending 45 gems to receive +500 energy. The gems were taken. The the energy is NOT added.** Out if energy and less the gems money taken. Too often.', ""Its ridiculous how the energy does not regenerate. I'm getting so frustrated,mad upset and irritated with it not being a fair game. Yes you are right. But you have to have the energy to clear the land.And it by far does not replenish near as fast as it uses it up. Thts just wrong. Make it more economical to play and be able to enjoy it. Still not satisfied with the energy on this game. We should be able to use the money we make on the game to buy energy as well. Tht would make it better some."", ""Overall I really like the game. Giving 1 start since I can't open the game anymore since the last update. Also there's just not enough energy given to play more than a few minutes every couple hours. At level 20+, only having ~55 energy is kinda ridiculous. Instead of going up 1 energy point per level it should give you at least 10, which still isn't much in this game but better than 1. Edit: After 9 days of being unable to open and play a game I've spent real money on, I'm uninstalling. Smh"", ""This game is frustrating because you run out of energy to quick to get anything done. It takes 8 energies and UP to remove bushes to trees, when you only have 50 energies to use. It's like they're forcing you to buy green gems to buy energy. I spent $4 on a special and I'm not doing anymore. I'm going to have to quit this game. 🙁"", ""I just want to point out that the annoying ad that keeps popping up on every game I play is inaccurate, foxes don't attack animals as big as sheep, a wolf would have been much more accurate although a little cliche. As someone who owns a pet fox and watches many of these ads, I get a little more pissed each time I see it."", ""I love the game itself, but there are a few things I think could be improved. Eggs are an item that's used in a lot of things, as well as being packed yet the hen's don't produce enough, the hen house doesn't hold enough. Items for energy produced in the missions need to spawn just a bit more. Is it possible for the candy store to regenerate faster? Waiting 5 hours or more tends to keep players from returning swiftly as the amount of energy that they receive in an hour might be used up fast."", 'The game needs more chances to play longer. Have ads to watch for extra gems or energy. Be able to convert coins to diamonds and diamonds to coins. Have apps you can download to give you diamonds and coins as well. Love the game just hate not having energy to play longer after ive searched all the islands for treasure. And done as much as i could to level up again.', ""Don't download if you think it's the classic card game, just another knock off of Farmville and it, takes a lot of energy just to do anything. Pointless game, the one in the advertisements looked more interesting than this hunk of junk. Would of been better if they made a card game. mind you al of of games advertise save this person before the bad guys get her by moving pins, stupid advertising just for clickbait downloads. @vizor apps ltd. no it isn't, I hope you like being clickbait. Good day"", 'I want to love this game but the lack of energy (without spending lots of $$$) ruins it. It takes over an hour to fill up energy but this only gives you 1-2 minutes of meaningful play. This could easily be a 5 star game for me but unless they make it easier to build energy it gets boring very fast.', 'It is not what the ad is about. The ad shows a smart game but the actual app is a silly village building childish whatever. It is a scam. The actual game might be a good one but I hate the attitude that they try to get more players through lies. I will tell everyone not to try this. Be fair and honest in your ads. Cheaters', ""Here is the thing. This game is really good and very fun and engaging but... it need lots of money to keep playing it. You run out of energy so freaking fast and then you'd have to wait quiet a while. Which by the way it gets me out of the flow I'm in while playing this game. The emeralds are also very expensive in my opinion, I don't think I'd be able to keep purchasing them at such a price. So I'm very sad to say this but ... goodbye I'm uninstalling the game. :/"", ""I really enjoy playing this game, however, there are a limited amt of energy resources. It would be nice to have more ways to get energy so you can extend your playing time without making purchases. It really makes no sense to me to purchase anything on these games bc you're only purchasing time,which is endless, leading to people spending endless amts of real money. Great for the maker, not for addictive personalities. Think before you spend bc you're buying time with nothing to show for it."", ""Energy should time build to at least 75 to truly make the game enjoyable. Even with the furnace, the cauldron and the match game, some things are almost impossible to do without using tons and tons of emeralds. With the current energy build level you can only do 2 or 3 things that take energy. Jumping in and out of Klondike so much to build time energy gets very boring. I don't know how much longer I will try to play. Otherwise the game would actually be really fun and very addictive.""]"

Im on level 38 and play it daily. Great fun. Got stuck early on with the storage, i almost deleted it, my daughter gave up on hers.

Can I get my coins back at least??', 'Good but you need to slow down on the initial orders till players get used to the game', 'Fun little game, challenging strategy at times, cute graphics.

Thank you for choosing Wonder Valley! We are always happy to see you in the game!","[""Great game. Could be better. Takes to much time for orders to be completed and it's to many of the longest orders that one can't fulfill in a timely manner. The guilds are great. Making friends from around the country is nice. But, we can take being in a guild to far, but, we work hard as a whole country community to complete boat, tent, dragon races, heart races, giving other members of the guilds to complete tasks. And then you have people to join guilds to get resources for their own agenda."", 'Wonder Valley is a beautiful game. I live it and can\'t put it down at times. Great graphics and music. I\'m looking forward to opening new areas! Good job developers! Months later still enthralled and interested. 😊 One thing... Limit the number of merch requests ""friends"" can ask for. I had to delete some ""friends"" because I felt like I was playing the game for them. Users', ""Similar to Township and Tribez but with actual fairy tale characters so they make it better than the other games imo. Addicting and enjoyable doesn't take too long to produce goods so you don't get stuck waiting all day to continue playing and leveling up. Overall fantastic game; if you like these types of games, then you'll definitely love this game. My favorite part is designing the layout of my village and using decorations to get creative to spruce it up. Other players give new ideas aswell"", 'I really do like this game, but it\'s getting harder and harder specially the ""Dragon race"". Why it asks for lots of goods?. At the same time you have ""ship orders"" to fill, Esmeralda\'s baskets, and also the game character\'s request. It\'s too much. I don\'t even want to do the dragon race. It asks for too many stuff and I can\'t play all day. If you can fix this, it will be appreciated and I like the game itself.', ""I love this game because I play it with my son but at the moment, since the last update it does not work more often than it works, super frustrating especially when festival of hearts or the dragon race is on and you can't win because you can't get in to collect your stuff and fill orders, would be great if you could get it fixed"", 'Very nice graphics and game... Just stared playing 2 days befor, just little confused with travern, when complete order, then it shows giving me rewards, some gold, xp and dimonds, gold and xp increses after completing but dimond not incresing, it remains same as before even it shows +4 after completing order, or just bug', 'Fun game but every so often when I press a button a sign pops up saying there is connection issues and it reloads the game. I do not have any internet issues. It is very annoying and would be great if you fixed it.', 'I love this game! I enjoy the dragon races and the guild. I would like to suggest a way of guild leaders know who is doing the race and number of tasks they complete. I also wish we could chose our prizes', ""I like it. Wish there's more ways to earn diamonds so I can keep up with the upgrades on the items they make......my 3 year old likes the game. He learned how to play it."", ""I don't know what is going on here, but I'm trying to spend diamonds to open a chest and it won't let me. I'm trying to win the dragon race and I don't have much time. This is not the first time this has happened and if it doesn't stop I will stop playing. Too bad because it's fun and relaxing when it works correctly."", ""It's very cute and very relaxing. A good way to pass time. I do enjoy the story telling and all. Just hate the items that take an hour or longer to make. Over all, the game is really nice."", 'A pleasure to play, with tons of great features! Bright colorful graphics, many activities and growth/production time is short. Excellent!', ""I'm feeling much different about this game now. I'm back loving it and I'm glad improvements was made to the game. I'm giving 5 stars again. Please don't make me feel different about the game again. Okay!!!!!!!"", 'Great game. Fun and interesting. Not too difficult too get the goods you need for the tasks.', 'Enjoyable. Excellent graphics. Time for crops and products is perfect neither too much nor less. Perfect time pass.', 'Great game, enjoying it so far! Wait times should be a lot shorter to avoid boredom though! Please consider this 😊', ""Error code 1402 once again glitched just froze up kept saying additional data etc can't load game stops at 11 percent I was in the middle of completing my ship with 40 mins left well that's gone now !!!"", ""The game is glitching so much! It doesn't leave the initial page when it's charging. It stops at 51%"", 'I love playing Wonder Valley! This game has gotten me through many of tough days. I recommend this game to anyone who needs something to help them refocus.', 'Fast paced game, you never get bored, graphics are great, awesome storyline.', ""Cute game but get to the point of not enough gems and can't collect anything, get to where you can join a guild and none are open and full, this is a crock of BS. They want you to buy gems that they will drain quickly. (No Way) Love the game but will have to delete it, can't advance any further.. BORING"", 'Keeps freezing during dragon race i cant produce product when trying to rush grow it by buying it. I only purchaced diamonds so i could pass the task now i cant even use them. And everything is exspensive.', 'You have to PAY to open that piggy bank so your paying for your diamonds, that u already pay for by filling orders and such, its not how it should be. Period. Im a gamer. Sure u made the game, but not everyone has the $$ to keep buying their own diamonds back from the piggy bank. For how much time everything takes, there isnt enough reward given. If you took my advice ud get somewhere. Im speaking the minds of thousands of other people that feel the same way but wont say it.', 'Ive been playing for a very long time and have gotten really far. Ive bought diamonds and coins etc. Its been great till now. It has been glitching. Example not letting me leave another area without my main farm not working properly. I can no longer access my profile stuff meaning my title name, my picture, nothing. It keeps showing notifications or new items avaliable that i cant access. Im really disapointed. Ive had it for so long and now its hard to play.', ""Very cute and fun. Easy to earn crystals too, that's always great."", 'Fun & Entertaining Game! Adorable fairy tale characters! Easy to earn 💎💎💎in the beginning. The number of in-game friends is WAY TOO FEW! In-game friends should be 50 minimum! As your experience/skill increases, so does the number of items needed to fill a ship. Jewels needed for ""posh"" decorations; and pets. Ugh! This is the 2nd part I dislike. I can\'t get a simple round pink jewel no matter what. Very frustrating. And 60 diamonds for 1 pink round jewel? Highway Robbery!', ""Overall the game is interesting. However, its ridiculous that all the gems collected from fulfilling orders and filling up of Esmerelda's basket goes into the piggy bank which we are required to pay to break the piggy bank. It does not make sense as we earn those gems.. what's the point of receiving gems through completing the orders when have to buy them back in the end???"", ""Can't see when I type and game has too many glitches. I paid and grew bored quickly."", ""Quite an enjoyable game!! Always new things added to keep it interesting and diverse but still reasonably paced to maintain it's leisure feel. Graphics are adorable and the gameplay is easy to grasp. I really like that it's not necessary to spend money to advance in the game, it simply aids in gameplay. Thanks dev team, great job!!"", 'My favorite game so far. The only disadvantage I\'m getting is I can\'t get off my phone because this is so addicting! There are a lot of things to do and goals to achieve so you\'ll never get bored. It is also not one of those games which are called ""pay to play."" You can play without buying anything. Some products take time to be produced but that\'s just the way they\'re supposed to be, I guess. Just a suggestion to lessen the waiting time and it\'ll be perfect. You\'ll def love it nonetheless.', ""Very cute game. No pressure to buy in app purchases, they're presented as optional, and that's as it should be. It reminds me of Castleville Legends which I really liked. This game moves at a comfortable pace. Cute graphics and characters. My only negative is that to enlarge the farm, we need to get decorations, but if there's no place to put them, they have to be stored, immediately. At least there is a place for storage, so the pros outweigh the cons. So far, so good! Very cute!"", ""Just got this game and I'm loving it so far. Only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is I wish the factories would say how many of each item I need either for the tavern, ship or esmeralda. It's hard to keep track of what I need to make and I don't like making things I don't need since some things take a very long time."", 'Lovely game if i could get into it. Keeps on telling to reload with error 1402 but nothing happening what now!', 'I love this game and very interesting, but past 2 days Iam not abt able to open the game. Plz fix this issue.', 'Great game! Fun and easy to play at your own pace, fast or slow. Cute graphics', 'UPDATE: Thank you for fixing the issue. Very quick response. Love the game but I can\'t get it to load today. I keep getting an error code of ""1402"". It did not give me a way to report. Could someone please inform me as to how I can fix this? 12/28/19 I\'m guessing there is a problem again as I can\'t get it to load again. This time the error code is different. It is 1400.', ""Way too many things required to fill ships, then most people require same items so they can't help. Also, unable to visit some friends' farms, but since you can't visit them, you can't take them off your friends' list to add other friends who are able to help. Just a lot of ridiculous issues that should have been resolved by this stage of the game."", 'Would be a good game.... I had to spend $$$ to get anything ""going"" after someone commented that you didnt have to spend anything. Game gets real slow and takes forever... Stuck at level 16 because i refuse to pay anymore. Mad that you charged me $2.99 for the $1.99 promotions. About ready to uninstall UPDATE: TOOK MY STARS DOWN TO ONE STAR! NO ONE GETS BACK TO YOU AND AFTER LEVEL 20 THE GAME SLOWS WAY DOWN WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY', ""I've not found a farming game this good in a long time! The graphics are wonderfully clear and colorful and the gameplay is excellent. Growth and building times are short and there's always something interesting happening. I highly recommend this super game to new farmers and long time players."", ""I downloaded this game the other day and played it. It was a fun game. Pretty fast paced. Today I kept receiving an error message. It told me to just hit reload. I did and I received the error message again. I uninstalled the game and reinstalled it. It popped up that the game needed an extra download. I allowed it then I received the error message again. It will not load. I guess I'm done playing this game.""]"

But this is one of the best farm games I have seen in a long time"", ""I really REALLY loved this game at first, i couldnt put my phone down for a week, lol....then....the more I progressed, and earned, i keep getting stuck, it takes the fun out of winning a piece of land, if you can't build or plant on it..."", ""Things take too long. Corn takes fortyfive minutes before harvest. Can't upgrade until a you reach a level that's way later than when you need it. It would be more enjoyable if the game went a bit faster than it does. I will probably uninstall it soon."", ""I would give it a 5 rating but because I have been logged on here every day it hasn't refilled. Can't finish tasks. So unfair. Otherwise really enjoy the game. I use to chop down neighbors trees and now I can't. So I can't finish tasks. Why? When did that change? Energy refills so slow come on your so on fair I log on everyday and the energy is at zero can't finish tasks. Your forcing me to installing it and I really like the game. You better get your act together now"", ""The game is interesting and fun if you like farming, but it takes way to long for some of the products. 9 hours wait time, or more, is not my idea of fun. Even 2 hours is pushing the time limit on waiting on a game.

I quit feeding them and waited forever for them to turn to statue but never do.. 2. How do we join Co-Ops? Answer questions for more stars! Thanks for helping with this great game! I for one am tired of making requests of support and never being answered. Why can't you help players with questions and concerns?"", 'So far so good. No problems with the download.

Tree need 119 energy to cut it but we have only 10 so we can use that 10 to cut it and deceased tree energy to cut to 109. Other else, Food: salt hardly to find and Shaman or Boat need too much stuff to complete,it just like Rob player while game give thing back not worst it.', ""I do like this game but God, we run out of energy extremely fast and it gets to a point where you can't do anything unless you keep removing trees or bushes, which you CAN'T do because you have no energy. And for someone who doesn't spend money on games, it is really frustrating. And, using the few diamonds you get, it is not an option."", 'Fun to play but energy goes very quickly and you have to wait soo long for everything, takes ages to get enough energy to click on 1 thing, its ridiculous how long you have to wait just to play for a couple minutes, the longest time you get to play is when you do the tutorial!', 'Love the graphic and the concept but you must pay to play and compaired to others games its very expensive. Have played many games for years and to upgrade is way to many rubies or items and most special play expires before you can earn enough energy. Saw many reviews say the same thing.', ""Not enough energy. It takes way too much energy to do anything. Takes forever to get energy. Makes the game super boring after the first 15 mins. After that you wait all day to play 5 mins. It's ridiculous. I'm about to uninstall."", 'Really cute game, but very slow to get buildings built and updated, and you run out of energy in the 1st 2 minutes of gameplay every time. Getting frustrated.', ""The game is really great. It's just that energy is so long to refresh and rubies are quite expensive and requited muh to progress faster. It's like every move needs ruby or payment but overall still good."", 'Must have a lot of patience with this game....gets better the longer you play. Addictive game and different to same old farming games. Give it a try and see if you like it!', ""I would have given 5-star if the energy resources in the game were easily available. As the game progresses to higher levels, the players are left with bigger tasks but lesser energy available. Some trees, stones and other stuff require energy count such as 79, 105 and even more... That's where the game becomes boring. The players have to either buy energy or wait until it replenishes. Otherwise, it would have been 5-star from me."", 'Great story line, I enjoy playing, I lose track of the time while playing. Graphics are great, the characters interact with each other really great job.', ""I love this game, but how much everything cost as far as energy goes is crazy. I have paid for extra energy in the hopes of completing even one of the side island challenges without supervision. And now the shower and toilet are even harder repair because of the material needed to fix them. It's a bit frustrating. Other than that it's a great game."", ""I like the concept. Game play is fun. There is alot of hurry up and wait tho. One thing that would be awesome is if left over energy would roll on top of a lvl up. Example: ( i have 60 energy and i lvl up. instead of just giving me the 72 (max lvl) add that 60 to the lvl up and give me 132) some items require alot to remove and the salt is on low supply. I feel i could play this for a long time. as long as the energy keeps rising. hard to make money on ad's if im capped out after 5 mins"", ""Minus the energy system and pricey ruby anything else just fine. Would better if add more material gain and bigger storage space since you need plenty of material just to craft few items. Edited : Coming back after a month uninstall it, didn't dissapointed. Notice that grass as important material had increased spam rate than before. I don't mind if I have to watch ads to get some gems/material especially for grass. But it should be optional not force player to watch ads."", 'Pleasant game.. But the amount of energy needed to chop trees, smash rocks etc is ridiculously high. When a rock says above 150, and you manage to gather the energy and smash it.. It does not clear it. It just reduces it to smaller part, needing additional energy. Also the rooster 2 hours to give meat when chickens are in just minutes? The amount of materials to build or upgrade are just too much and times go higher for the items. Of course one can just recharge and advance faster..', ""It's a good game indeed but it's really Enjoying having to wait so long for energy and you can't cook food without salt which I can hardly get. I think I'm gonna be stuck at a standstill. I already spent some money. But I don't think I would again as it seems it will just take me far to long to progress. Just to break a large tree will take hours and hours. Shame as it's a great game. Xx"", ""While this game has a great storyline and storytelling, it does lack on play. Never have enough energy to complete the tasks starting on level 10. Many have written about this issue on their FB page. Total Energy increases by 3, after each level. It's impossible to chop down a tree of 114 energy when only given 75 at the start of game! Having the island dwellers eating your food after you've cooked it, can give xtra energy but costs resources to make it.NEEDS WORK with ENERGY. UNINSTALLING."", 'This game is fun, but it takes a long time to collect things you need to make the game progress. In game energy, which is used for everything, is hard to collect and makes the game way less fun. Just a small decrease in energy costs and increase in energy production would make the game a 5 star game. Even simple things to collect cost so much energy and only give 2 resources. Fixing this would make the game more fun to play and I might be willing to buy things in game. But now there is no point.', 'I like this game. Simple ,easy to play. I only see two problems. One the wait times are too long. I sometimes find myself leaving the game to go do something else to let some time pass. (Which In Turn Makes Me Lose Interest. ) And the second thing is it takes too much to rebuild your energy so you can continue playing. (I once again find myself going out to do something else losing interest.) <<<<<<< Ding,Ding, Red Flag Warning here>>>>>>>>>', ""Would be a good game if you didn't have to wait for energy to fill, don't even get enough energy to chop a tree down or stone, nothing to do. Dropped it 2 stars for reply. you get 73 energy, 175 to chop trees n stone ? Yes you collect 12or 3 energy every so often, it's not enough lol everything you do it takes your energy , theres better games with unlimited energy, this is a game where it wants you to spend money, sorry, and thank for reply.good luck ."", ""Very geared to purchases. Not much you can do at one time if you don't pay to play. Not sure if I will stay with the game or not. Fairly fun / relaxing when I'm able to do anything. Update: the special events are almost pointless. Require quite a large sum of real money to really play. Just a scam. You guys want to make money, add a watch ads feature to earn gems. I'm not spending money on a game like this. Are you crazy? Update 2: Thanks for the response. Please look at what other games are doing. If you ad an option to watch advertisements in exchange for gems or energy, you will have a good game. People who don't want to watch ads can opt out and buy gems or just wait. It's fun at times, but using all the energy I can get at one time doesn't even allow cutting down some individual trees. Everything requires so much energy, I get to play for about 3 minutes then have to wait many hours, which for me means waiting until the next day. As it is, I gave up on the Christmas and Valentines islands. No way to do them without spending more money that I earn in a day at work. This makes you folks seem VERY greedy."", 'I do not normally rate games...However!, I am a little frustrated. First, it is too hard to get enough energy to complete anything you want to do. Second, I opened a new island..thought it was the same as the entire rest of the game where you use energy to ""clear"" the map..however, it used up my diamonds..would have been nice to have a message that said ""hey, are you sure you want to use all your diamonds!""?? Anyway, I will continue to play for now but fix those things, please :)', ""Pretty fun overall. But WHY are my gems disappearing on their own? I have gone from 32 to 20 to 34 to 19 now down to 14 and I haven't even had a chance to even try to use them. I like playing, the graphics are great, I like that there are multiple ways to earn energy. Are the gems use them or lose them? Edit: Just since I wrote this review, not even an how ago, I'm now down to 9 gems . And again, no, I'm not using these gems, I haven't even needed to yet! Thank you for reply, I did contact supp."", ""I would have given it 5 stars if there wasn't so much waiting time to produce the amount of stuff needed for upgrades and huge amounts of energy needed to chop down trees and break stones. One third of energy requirements would have been more than enough considering you need almost twice the amount of your full energy bar just to chop down a single large tree and it takes forever to level up if you can't do nothing except stare at the screen."", '👍 Family island is a good game to pass your time but like the other players... getting energy is harder than the task somtyms. Guyz after going through few reviews your replies seems like auto answering text (almost same repeated replies) would be great to hear from the real ones if its the case. Btw it would be real fun if we could rotate the ""in game items"" and not only move them so that we can arrange and give a new look to our village according to the surroundings. Thank you so much!', ""I LOVE the dialogue between the characters and that they all help complete tasks and interact with one another, without me just playing the one main character. I love this game, just wish everything didn't cost my entire energy bar just to keep up! Even still, it's kept me (impatiently) waiting an hour at a time to refill my energy and come back. Which is more than what i can say for most any other game I've ever played."", ""I absolutely love the game. But am quickly getting frustrated with how many energy you use and how quickly you run out. I am literally on the game long enough to perform 2 or 3 simple actions and proof they are gone. Progression is very very slow. I don't have enough time to enjoy playing. My love will fade. Offer more ways to earn energy and lots of it!"", 'Fun and challenging, good game could be a great game. However the length of time it takes to regenerate energy is frustrating. The amount of energy it takes to preform tasks needs to be addressed. IE if a tree has 100 energy and you only have 50, you should be allowed to use that energy to deduct energy off that object. It would greatly improve game play ability.', ""I love this game at the beginning. But I cannot recommend this game to others because of this 'energy' problem. I am at level 21 and I am literally 'stuck' because of this. There are so many things to do but the energy is ridiculously limited. It seems like putting cash on is the only way to play. I've read your comments about this problem. But that's totally wrong. That things even can't give energy that can cut a big tree. Ridiculous, I am so frustrated after paying $35 on energy. Silly!"", 'It\'s not a game to hold your attention. Within five minutes you\'re out of energy. They ""say"" you can make food but there\'s no salt. When you log back on and have full energy, Within five minutes it is drained again and you are unable to do anything. If you\'re looking for something you can play for over five minutes, I would look elsewhere.', 'Its always the same answer WE the players need patience. But at some point the developers need to start to fix the issues. The game could be great. But the amount of work and time it takes to do EVERYTHING is ridiculous. Plus how much energy it takes to gather the resources to do anything. All the developers ever say is cook food for energy. I DO cook food. I still get to play the game for 15 minutes at the most, then I have to wait. Its obvious to me that they just want you to spend your money.', ""Game is lots of fun, but I'm stuck on several upgrades because I cannot find the claws needed to manufacture the needles which are needed for the ropes. Always discouraging to get stuck due to game creation issues. Your response does not help. For several levels the Shaman no longer gives claws and I have looked on islands for thorns and have not received any."", ""It was ok... the only issue is that it takes so much energy to chop things and time to build things that you dont have enough energy to get everything done, as well as inventory to build it all. It's just takes roo much, time, inventory and energy to play the game. Overall it's a nice game to play, just gets boring with the lack of material."", ""Very fun game, but it's not one you can enjoy for hours that can keep you engaged because you run out of energy so fast, you do get it back from the word by finding food and gifts but the fact that you have to remove obstacles like stone and tree to get to the gift is counter productive because what you consume to get these gifts by removing obstacles in most cases doesnt even give back in enegery. It takes way too long to even have an adventure on this game. If they changed it it would be fun."", 'Good game...good graphics... Just the issue is that the available maximum energy is too low to perform tasks. Even an house upgrade allow you 3 more energy bars than previous after too many resources and time is taken to upgrade the house. Please increase the maximum energy level and also the no of energy bars that will be increase with an upgrade(atleast 20). Thank you', ""Overall it's a relatively fun little game, but you run out of energy ridiculously quickly and there's no way to tell what amount of resources you'll get from what you use your energy to collect. For instance- I chopped down a pine tree that took 92 energy (more than the 78 I can accumulate on my own at house level 7) and only got 3 pieces of wood from it and two pine cones. It's a decent time killer for people without a lot of extra time on their hands, but that's about it."", ""The reason I didn't gave it 5 star is that the orders to build this and that are too much and there are not so much things and sometimes when its easy to get the items there is no energy.When we open the game there is too much energy but when we use it only for 3,4 items there is no energy.Even bathroom and shower get broken.To open chest we need to finish merchant orders which asks things used to upgrade building.So, where should we use these items in merchant order or upgrading the building?"", ""It's getting harder to get resources to make the things you need. Energy disappears too quickly. I make food, try to make the stuff to trade with the shaman and the boat. You need the stuff you trade to upgrade building so it defeats the objective of the game. I fix the toilet and shower, then find I cant do other stuff as i run out of resources. Its getting frustrating waiting for the energy bar to refill all the time. How about some mini games to help with energy or gems"", ""It's fun and addictive the energy takes slow to recharge but overall it's a fun game with a story to it."", 'I have been playing the game quite early since it world wide release. But the game glitches so much!!!!! I had just completed the polar island quest yesterday and started on the star Island quest, yet today when I open the game my entire progress gets reset to the beginning of polar island quest!!! Overall the game is okay, barring the glitches.', ""I gave the game 3stars because somethings take too much time to build. For instance making finished wood takes an hour, waiting for a lot of things which takes so much time can really be so so frustrating. Another is amount of energy needed to chop down some trees, stones, clay... So much makes the game frustrating and progress slow. I don't know how long i can put up with the patience.""]"

Happy farming!","['I enjoy the game, but the time it takes to build up the farm and be successful in completing tasks takes forever!! The tasks list does not match up with the level of your farm. For example, you have chicken coop only and at the market every order needs goats for cheese. You have to delete the orders for cheese so you can sell enough eggs to get the money to buy a goat.. I was hoping that your update would have helped but no luck. I play the game in between other games for this reason.', ""Now that I have gotten into a rhythm, I really like this game. Only gripe I have is everything needs gold and there is no way to earn it or get it except to buy it. I've been playing for about 6 months and have learned the tricks. Strategy is everything. Setting priorities. I still think more up front explanation would be good. There needs to be a confirm button when spending cash. It is a very enjoyable game if you dont obsess. Have fun a d pick a good co-op."", ""I used to love this game. I still love the basic premise of it. It's the perfect mix of strategizing and mindless clicking. But the developers keep tweaking it to the point where I am losing all patience with the game. There are constant updates which cause bugs and other issues, and many of the most recent updates have been poorly thought-out and implemented, and either require you to spend real money or bring your play to a standstill when you cannot keep up with impossible product demand."", ""Decent game, stuff takes too long and costs too much to make it enjoyable to play daily. Too many elements (especially different types of in game currency) that make it a bit too hectic and annoying to try to figure out how to get what from what. The real money purchase options are a joke, I'm sure enough people invest in it but I'd never give them a dollar for how much they charge for such little reward. Not worth it. Really only play it because I get real money rewards from another app."", 'This is a really cool farming game the only thing that is frustrating is the time it takes to build stuff and the time of production for some things.

Its a very stimulating game. Keep up the good work just if we could cut down on production time it would even be more awesome....', ""I enjoy this game very much....a few thing I'd like to see. We should be able to package up our whole farm ...clean slate to rearrange much easier ..I know decorations can be but a while clean farm would make it much easier....gold...gold should be easier to come by...I love the new daily rewards but there should be more rewards in tournaments an tasks...expansion deals should be way better once a month as well...like maybe one day a month so cheap a few plots could be bought...jus some thoughts"", 'Loved the game until it will no longer update.

The one thing that bugs me is the time on some things. Like 11hours is to long even 6hours is.

Its frozen up on me right now and really hope it gets fixed soon and while your at it maybe reconsider some of your package deals cause they are not really that good of a deal, maybe the ones that are 300% match are more realistically affordable. It's a game not a requirement so people are less apt to spend the money when trying to live."", 'Latest update is dreadful - keeps dropping out and claiming a bad internet connection (this only happens in this app, not any other and internet connection is fine). Otherwise enjoyable, but the glitch in this latest version makes me want to uninstall.', ""I enjoy the game. Like some others on it, it is a welcomed distraction from pain and other things. I like the different challenges. I do wish it would award more mallets, if you don't have real $ to drop you nearly hit a stand still. If I stop playing that would be why, so that I don't spend $."", ""Advertised as a casual farmer, but allows freedom in building; strategy isn't explained well enough so it's easy to build what isnt needed, creating bottle necks, and digging yourself in a hole: where it feels only paying real money will get you out. It's not obvious what buildings are available to interact with, level locked or available, they look the same until pressing it; unless there's a sale relating to that, then you have icons all over the screen; but not for free league rewards."", ""Well made and designed time suck. Relies heavily on you spending your time waiting for stuff to happen. Can skip waiting for $$$ but otherwise, expect to spend hours of your life to advance anything. Graphics, music, sound effects, programming are all top notch, but I don't like investing so much time on something that makes zero positive impact on my real life. This game has nothing to offer but wasted time."", 'Iam a old player of the game since the original big farm. The new feb 10 update is nice the ui feels snappier and easy to use than before. Can please bring some of the changes from original bigfarm in online game like the co-opirative tree ,gorse ranch etc,and the farm management is better in the original bigfarm .

Also they require too many stars for so so so many little things. Making each day take forever . But over all its a good game. Makes you think about what moves to make with the limited moves given each round. Lately, the game keeps freezing, moving slow, tons of glitches. I enjoyed this game until recently. It's a shame because it's getting fun with decorating the rooms."", ""While it's true the game is entertaining, it's also very greedy, needy, and misleading! You must check in daily for bonuses, but this game basically requires you to play non-stop in order to get rewards and move up the leaderboard and get to the next league. Otherwise, you are demoted. Also, every single action in the game requires stars to execute, and you only get one star per level passed! They also rig levels so you have to use boosts to pass! And where's the story mode? I think I'll delete!"", ""Homescapes is a lot easier, and doesn't make it so you have to either buy something or wait multiple days to get enough daily prizes to get a chance at beating a level. I spent $10 on it and it was gone in less than an hour. I love this game, but maybe make hard levels optional? I'm really stuck. I stopped playing cause I need to rack up wheel spins before I even get anywhere. Also, the farther you get along, the less customization. And I wanna be able to un-wildwest my area. It looks weird..."", ""Despite the advertisements being completely false, which doesn't make any sense to me (hence 3/5 instead of 5/5), the game by itself is really fun. I like how you can unlock so many things, the humor, and the frequent events. I read from others that you can't play/win without paying, but you can (at least till level 400), unless you give up easily."", ""If you are installing this game coz of their ad, then DON'T. This game is nothing like you saw in the ad. It's just another candy crush lookalike. You get coins for completing each round and can use that coin to buy things to decorate a garden. When I saw the ad, I thought it must be a fun game to play. I played for hours thinking, maybe the actual game will be available after completing few rounds. Wasted my time. I don't understand why Google won't take any action against such misleading ads."", 'The game wasnt as advertised. You cant pass the higher levels without spending money. It will give you bombs to help but place it where you cant use it, like the side of the board already finished. Or it will land on the one spot you have a move, forcing you to use it early. Or it will land on the one spot where you could have made another bomb, thus helping your game. It requires more stars to finish the tasks but you cant finish the tasks without spending money.', 'I like the levels and challenges. But when you are able to decorate the rooms, you do not get enough time keys fast enough to finish the rooms. I do not like the fact that you are not given the chance later on to continue finishing the rooms you started in a separate challenge. Other games allow you to swap.bombs and ""rainbow blasts"" to create more of the bombs, this game does not offer that. Without spending tons of money, you will not beat all the levels and get what you want.', 'Not as advertised. No puzzle games. Dont waste your time or money. When they put out the same games that are advertised I might re download. But I will be uninstalling. And I have atleast 3 games from Playrix. I also have no problem with buying things in games. This is a huge loss for Playrix. Many of my friends play( adults with jobs) and they feel the same way. Today is the day we remove Playrix until they advertise honestly!', 'The game started out fun then really slowed down. The levels get more difficult, which is to be expected, but after a few days of unsuccessful attempts I give up. The stars also have much less value later on too. Serving lemonade, calling someone, and other worthless tasks feel like a waste of stars, which become increasingly difficult to obtain.', 'Just another 3match variant- not at all what was advertised. I used to play this a lot when it was a hidden objects game. I loved it and was sooo disappointed when I had to change phones and could not get the game back. I have bought several Playrix games and loved them. They have all disappeared and I cannot recommend Playrix any more. Too bad. They used to be goid.', 'Far too heavily reliant on purchasing of coins etc to complete levels. You can do a level 100 times and still not get through it. Even after purchasing and using bombs and extra moves is no guarantee and is most likely that it will not help you. Has the making of a good game but not if you cannot complete levels within reasonable attempts or use of extras. There are better games out there.', ""Firstly, it's disgusting that i downloaded this game and it is absolutely nothing like what is being advertised. I tried playing it anyway; turns out its just yet another match game. The levels are really hard to beat and you gain only ONE star EVERY TIME. Instead of being relaxing and fun, the game is very frustrating. I won't recommend it."", ""I would give this a no star if I could, cause you play till level 580 and. More and still don't get anywhere unless you pay money to buy stuff, it's enough that you require WiFi or a lot of data to play this game, but to be stuck at a level for 2 weeks because you don't pay money for bombs and whatever is utterly stupid, it's a very nice game except for that"", 'I got this game because the ads made it look fun. The game has no puzzles like the ads. I do like the story in the game but some of the puzzles are impossible to pass. I would like easier puzzles so I can progress in the story. Right now I am stuck on a level and cant get past it. I will not pay $ to buy bombs or rainbows and the level I am on, you almost have to to progress.', ""The game is good but I really don't like the length of animations when completing 'Day' tasks; way too many videos and it's annoying having to press 'Skip' all the time, which you have to wait for following an initial animation. Would be amazing if there was a feature in settings to disable the animations or fast forward them. I have 421 stars and will take forever to use them up and complete tasks."", 'Comparable to what others have said, the game is not like the ads I saw that lead me to download it. In addition, I noticed that there are several files downloaded to my device in the playrix folder that appear to be profile pictures. I have never seen these pictures before and don\'t use the ""team"" feature"". I deleted all of the files and the next day there was a new batch.', 'False advertising! While the game itself is a pretty decent match-3 game where you earn ""energy"" to make yor garden prettier, there are no trace of the levels shown in pop-up ads for this game shown in other apps. If you expect ""catastrophe"" or ""escape"" levels, you will be disappointed. I would easily give 5 stars for the decent implementation of the match-3 genre but give only three because of their deceptive ads. I will modify my score when I see true ads for this game.', ""Waste of time. Advertised as a completely different game than what it is & it's ridiculously unrealistic. Each level gives you a goal of collecting a certain # of things but only gives a tiny amount of moves to do so. Example; one of the levels has the goal of collecting 50 leaves & 40 flowers. You have to grow the flowers by the batch (which takes 3 moves minimum per batch), and you only have 27 moves to complete all of this. You only get 5 lives & must wait 30 min to regain 1 life. UNINSTALL"", ""Overall it's a really fun and addicting game that keeps me busy when I'm bored. I wish there was another option instead of spending 900 coins for 5 more moves. Often times I only need 1 more move and coins are hard enough to get. Maybe a 400 coins for 1 move? 500 even but 900? That's a bit steep for 1 more move. Other than that it's an amazing game and I'll keep playing. Will change to 5 star if devs make 1 more move option."", ""Deceitful ads, it shows a completely different game, so when you download it and start playing it's nothing like you where shown. The game is ok but gets boring since the difficulty of a level is completely random and the tasks you get are really annoying. The one star is mainly because of the ads, don't show me something you don't have."", 'Downloaded the game based on the ads shown and expected it to be something like puzzle. But it was nothing like the ad. Apart from that, when i started playing, i realised that i earn a small number of coins at end of a level, ie 50-60 and need a whopping 900 coins for extra moves. Nothing like i expected. Hard levels to ensure one ends up spending money to buy lives/other resources. Very disappointed. Will uninstall it in a while.', ""Been playing this game since 2015. Fun and good past time game! This let you save your progress. That way even if you have problems with your phone and decided to get a new one. You can still continue where you left off. Sounds great, right? But if there are updates of this game. It won't let you open the app. So you need to be connected to the internet to download the updates. Rest assured, once its updated you can play it offline."", ""I'm very disappointed with gardenscapes. Some levels are impossible to complete with the amount of moves given. In order to win certain levels you have to pay for extra moves. I find myself stuck on certain levels for days on end, missing out on the flower infinity rewards, or not being able to compete in competitions. Also on YouTube tutorials with certain levels I see that the people playing have extra moves avaliable from the start, how is this possible??"", ""The game itself is addictive and a good way to kill time. I'm rating the game so low because of the FALSE ADVERTISING THAT MADE ME WANT TO INSTALL THE GAME in the first place. If you are thinking this is a game where you will be making decisions on what option to choose in order to accomplish a goal without meeting an unfortunate ending, you too have been tricked by the ads. This game is nothing more than Candy Crush with a storyline attached."", ""Misleading ! Your ads that brought this game to my attention and why I choose to download is false. Once downloaded I no longer find the game with the ads. I find I have to decorate and restore a garden. If you actually made the game for play that you use to trick people into downloading you'd actually have a popular game maybe worth spending money on. This will be an uninstall for me. Make what you advertise."", ""Game is nothing like what is advertised within another game. Advertisement showed chosing tools to give to a couple to solve a problem scenario. Instead I'm being forced to play a game similar to candy crush in between steps of building a garden. Not my idea of fun. Each step is guided, so I can't pick what I want to do. Deleting now."", 'Terrible game unless you are into spending money every 5 minutes. They make certain levels impossible to pass unless you buy coins which allow you to continue play to be able and finish the level. Dont waste your time. UPDATE: I gave it another go after I finally passed the level I was having issue with and got another impossible to pass without paying level. Deleting the game completely..glad I didnt give them any money! I have played a few playrix games and they are not for me.', 'The app is amazing with superb graphics but I would give 5 stars only if we are given more days to renovate a room and are allowed to keep the room even if we have not finished renovating. The time lapse is so short that to renovate the room completely we should leave our work and sit at home to play. Please consider this option. To atleast let us have the room with what we renovated.', 'Imagine ordering a blue top and you get a pink dress instead. That\'s how this game is. False advertisement. Don\'t know which genius in the creative department came up with ""hey guys, let\'s lie in the ads, make them install the game and maybe they will stick around!"" and everybody applauded. This game is a lie and a waste of time. Here\'s some useful feedback.', ""Can't earn stars to get tasks done fast enough unless you buy them with money and not the game money. Some of the levels are impossible unless you spend money to busy boost ups and game play money. Game is rigged so that you can only get to certain points until you spend so much money to the developers!!! Uninstalling!!! Been on same level for 4 days and spent money and level still can't be beat (level 25) so uninstalling!!!!"", 'Knocking it down two stars because the advertising is misleading about what the game actually does. I downloaded the game because it advertised me saving characters through decision making in difficult situations and I am on level 1317 and the game is still just matching fruit and decorating a garden! Pretty irritating. I have even spent money to see if I got to certain level, then it would be part of the game. Nope. If you enjoy match games it is cool. Same issue with Homescapes.', 'Thanks for making a fun game but you sure know how to rob someone of the joy of having a new game by running to normal pay to with method. This is a nice game but to continue to get stars to do task then your going to have to pay. Im going to give the game another day but will probably uninstall for it being just like every other game.', ""First off, this game is not like what we see in the ads. I like the mix between designing the landscapes (which you have little liberty in, but can still be pleasing) and match-the-shapes game. You can get to 700+ levels without any in-app purchases, with some patience. The levels are not too dificult to beat, and the power-ups are quite easy to get. Don't be fooled by the assigned level of difficulty, though."", 'I""ve been playing for a while & it\'s just all moving up the next level trying to get star to fix, clean, an area of the garden. The ads show you are able to play mini games with the chatacters, but thats not true. The ads are false advertizing. It would be fun if they really did add in those mini games like they advertise. Sadly, it\'s not true. Thats the whole reason why I got both Gardenscapes & Homescapes. I\'m over levels 100 and still not anything like how they advertise. Very disappointing', 'I downloaded this game because I kept seeing the ad where you have to save someone by figuring out which bars to raise/lower. THAT looked fun, but to my surprise, I have only been able to play candy crush type games (the last of which I haven\'t been able to beat). I didn\'t download this app to play candy crush and I don\'t want to have to wait 10 more levels to get to the type of puzzle that\'s advertised. It seems like my complaint is pretty common among the ""scapes"" games. Will be uninstalling.', 'Have been playing for some time, and am getting further discouraged on how the rate of wins is greatly affected and tampered with. In multiple levels where you need to collect a certain amount of butterflies but the amount of butterflies on the board is less than the amount of moves?!?! Makes it impossible to win the level. I have been stuck on a level for so long, using up all my resources to get 1 butterfly in 3 moves, and never has a butterfly come into the game board! Very disappointing.', ""I dont understand why I am seeing these new ads all over the place. I've played this game and homescapes, and it's a match 3 game. This is not a bad game, however there is NO puzzle aspect what so ever. Why does your preview page now showcase this garbage? Keep the advertisements truthful so I can rate the game as it deserves to be rated."", ""This one of the worst games I have ever played. It's all about money making. The puzzles themselves are so full of wasted moves that it can be impossible to complete some of them. You spend a long time trying. Instead of renovating the gardens you spend more time on pointless quests. Totally pathetic. You the developers should be ashamed."", 'This is not a game in the usual sense but a machine to user cash out. It will succumb to and praise user and then drive to booster shortage which means impossibility to complete the level. So user have to (MUST) spend money to buy extra boosters to progress. User can be unskilled thats no matter: game is not predictable in anyway. Other than that user get gorgeous graphics, interesting story and nicely developed characters.', ""A great game but not player friendly. Some levels are so unnecessarily difficult to pass making it impossible to continue. And yes, I know every level is passable. But I've been trying to pass a one certain level for days!!! Your computer I'm playing against makes it impossible. So although I truly enjoy this game, I'm done. This isn't fun anymore.""]"

Game play improvements","[""Hello game. I want to request/report a behavior. Some time back I had bought the experience doubler pack. And I enjoyed it too. But there's no way for me to turn that off now, or deregister from the pack. My exp grows quicker than I can earn money, so the orders are a lot about items I cannot yet build, but have become available to my level. Can you either turn it off, or disable that for my account please? Thanks"", ""Game is amazing it first. I loved it. Then naturally you hit that brick wall where you can't do anything unless you're spending real life money. Edit... Their response below basically says you can purchase more gems whenever you want. Just as i said before, Fun game at first, but you're not going to advance without spending real world money over and over and over."", ""Might be more fun to play if the game stop having top up all the time in stop freezing up all the time who can play with all of that going on you go to settings to try to stop it they ask for your.code number you don't know what they are talking about if.you want any one to play your game then fix it so they can or am going to stop playing it in tell everyone how sorry the game is get it fixed"", ""Let me tell you about this game. It's a simple game, nothing crazy fancy. Yea, the game has glitches but most of them can be taken care of by restarting the game. What I really want to tell you about is the support team, they are the true heroes. I lost my game due to a phone crashing and they gave me an entire game back!"", 'sooo much fun.. it is easy to earn the gems needed to speed up things. the only thing I feel could use some help is the side matching fruit games. some are way to confusing and difficult. also, there needs to be a way to earn garden plots quicker, but w gems or something. cant keep up w anything w such limited plots.. 1,9,2020 update: 2.6.2020.. needs to be a chainsaw for like 5000.00 for maybe 20 uses or so. the axes are not good enuff and there needs to be a way to get down tge trees quicker', 'Plain fun! Very relaxing n figured out how to do it without spending money! I just love this game!!! Love sitting here relaxing n farming, lol.', 'I really like this game. Especially being able to play offline. But I wish it was possible to go borrow from a neighbor too. Also, I really like the rain showers. Wish it would rain more often. Update. Still liking the game, but some of the ""Target Level Games"" take forever to end! One level took over 5 minutes to end after I received ""Victory "". That\'s frustrating.', 'Love the game. It is lots of fun but still has a problem with freezing up and closing.', ""I haven't received my 600 Gems after purchasing it. I wrote an official complaint email to you recently. Please look it up thank you. Edit: My problem was solved within 48 hours! Thank you guys! I will continue to support this game. Giving it a 4 stars cause I feel like there's a lot more room for improvement! Will definitely recommend this to my family and friends! Thanks!❤"", 'Great game, am loving it but as you get to above level 20 the times to produce things become unrealistic as does the leap in price of further shops', ""I really do like this game! Its awesome when you don't have data or WIFI! The only problem I can say about this game that I don't like is how hard or expensive to increase storage space with the barn or silo!"", 'The game is still not suitable for playing due to the following problems *first getting coins in the game is very hard this makes playing the game difficult since opening different things such as train station needs coins *Second getting diamonds is a very big problem this affects the efficiency in playing since diamond(gold) is important in fastening playing of the game also in adding the production of different things such as sugar *Third still sometimes the game fail to work and closes', 'I hate the new update, the animation you did everytime you harvest literally everything you do the coins or any item has to bounce a lot blocking your view of whatever your doing, please fix this. Not to mention the coins are bigger now plus the animation is sick kindly turn it back to how it used to be and keep the vip feature or whatever you did in this update.', ""They're not a online game. But they gave the opportunity to play the same level when I changed my mobile. Reply for me also came as fast and my issue was solved quickly."", ""I'm so dam pissed off it's no funny. I loved this little game, i restarted my computer and lost all my data to the game, it sent me back to the beginning. I was on level 39, i'm to through. Should be a way to recover your progress, very pissed off."", 'Fun game. Few glitches, nothing major though. Highly addictive', 'Very addicting but not in a bad way. Play it several times a day but does not take to much of mine time. And it plays offline. Amazing game.', 'Ever since the last update I have been having problems. The machines have been producing different products instead of the ones they suppose to. Like flowers shop producing cupcakes etc', 'Awesome. Specially cuz its an offline game with free stuff. I love it.', ""This game is COMPLETE copy of Hay Day. The only reason I downloaded this awfull app is because It was offline. I switched to hay day and had a much more fun and lively experience. You want to do better in that while you just want to uninstall this. The only downside of Hay Day is that it's online like many other farming games which doesn't allow me to play in many places. One word: AWFULL"", ""ok 5 stars just for support you , it's good game but graphics and animation are ugly i like the gameplay but the decoration in the shop aren't that beauty add online also and train points leaderboard , Good Luck ❤️"", ""The game was excellent as I was in 21 level but when I opened the game yesterday, the game was in the first level.l am too upset how can such kind of irresponsible technical mistakes are occured. So plz do something..nosence game don't download it. But i have already uninstalled the game."", 'Love this game but for the past month I cannot play. It freezes all the time. When you try to plant one thing it does something else. When you go to make one thing it does something off the wall. So ready to uninstall it.', ""I don't like your game it has a thing in there where you get free Jewels for watching videos when the video is over it shows three jewels going up to be collected but it only registers as one joule that sucks I'm deleting your app"", ""I love this game bc I don't use internet and it's cool. Download hurry u won't b disappointed. Can u felas make it online so we can help our neighbors and offline still. Another thing how come it wont work but it will sometimes work."", 'I love this game. My only concern is the production of some things is super slow,like it will take 24hours. Please make it fast. 👍👍👍', 'Addictive,but its hard to earn gems. Even ads are not available. All items are so expensive', ""I love Farm Day and it just makes it even better that it's an offline game because I can play it when I'm not at home. This is an awesome game, full of fun I highly recommend it if you're into building villages. 10/10"", ""Very easy to play but it takes a long time tor creating something like baking and harvesting. Overall it's a good game.."", ""Great game, so far. I've been playing for about a month, no problems. Ads, but that comes with everything you play unless you pay to stop ads."", ""A lot of fun, esp. when you have a lot of free time lol. One thing is, I hope there will be more shops and farm decors, I'm running out of options at level 48 😂."", 'Updates created lag. Otherwise it WAS a great, easy passtime without having to use internet. Laggy lag lag now.', 'Ads that cant be cancelled. When u are planting seeds half way, the game slaps u with ads that cant be cancelled, wasting your time endlessly', 'You wrote there are new levels in the update but there are no new levels what is the issue', ""Ita an alright game but it's so touchy when I go to do something, as in plant crops the whole menu will disappear."", 'I really like this game. Improve the chance to get more coins.', ""It's nice pass time. It's just to small, hope it can be zoom a little bit more."", 'Cute game. Too many ads, you forget what you have to do.

You know the ones, where you build to produce resources, clear more land, and do the same thing over again, with some weak plot as the driver. The only thing that shows any creativity is the art, which is super adorable. But I'm really sick of playing the EXACT SAME GAME over and over again, and if devs want my money they're going to have to try something new."", ""This game is terrible. Everything takes so long and requires this which requires this which requires more storage that you can only play for a couple minutes at a time which is really boring. Actions don't work right, you press one thing and it either ignores you completely or does something else. And this is on a brand new device! I play for tapjoy rewards hoping to find new games i like along the way. I don't even think i can stick with this long enough to get my reward, thats how bad it is."", ""I really liked playing the game but am finding it difficult to get anywhere. You can only create so much magic potion at a time, but they want you to use it to use for several challenges at once: decurse areas and to fix the tower, excetera excetera. There's never enough to do everything that needs to be done. Also, I need to join a Clubhouse to do a bunch of stuff. I've sent out requests to just about everyone that they give me on the list and have not been approved for anyting."", ""Can you please make this game where we can buy stuff from other people's storage . It's crazy to spend 25gems to get what we need. Other games have it where we can go to the people storage and buy what we need. It makes it easier for us and to finish our tasks quicker. I really do love this game. But please make it where we can go into others storage .please"", ""I used to love the game. Dont like the bonus games they have like the valentine race, not coordinated enough to avoid obstacles. Want you to join groups to get further in game then playing alone. Would have given 5 stars before but now the game isn't holding my interest like it did when I first started playing."", 'I love this game! I would give it 5 stars if the ""factory\'s"" were easy to get. Like give some free and if we want another then we would buy them. Another thing is growing crops is the biggest demand so instead of giving 3 farm patches every so many levels let us be able to get more. Other than that this game is awesome and very addictive.', ""Just started four 🌟 now. Down to 3 stars because quickly ran out of resources to play, unless I keep purchasing them. Too bad, I did like this game just can't afford it to advance. Aside from that, I wish I could decurse areas faster rather than one piece at a time (expl one brick on a wall or one window on a house)."", ""It was rough starting this game at the end of October. Now level 31 and the new update has made things all the more difficult. Tasks only change out once a day so don't plan on trying to extra coins for a fountain. I had 499 friend tokens but there all gone now and the new system doesn't give hardly anything for helping others. After the BS of the November event being stuck in competition with players 20+ levels above me, I'm ready to uninstall. They really just want your money now."", ""Got old really quickly. Their old game Sunken Secrets was way better and super addictive. They didn't even improve anything. They basically took that game and made it more complicated and annoying. The building and updating supplies should not be part of your goods inventory. It fills up way too quickly. They made the graphics, balloons and dives even lamer. I could go on and on with comparisons. I was very disappointed. They should have just stuck with Sunken Secrets :("", ""I love this see game, it is so cute and I love the story behind it too. I would definently recommend this game to ev1. Ty and keep up the good work. I am adding more on after months of playing. I sadly have to knock my review from five stars to one star because I can't even play after months of playing and lots of my money and time into Decursed. It has been three weeks and they still have not fixed it. So sad. I really liked this game."", ""Used to enjoy playing but constant crashes have ruined it. Now can't even get in the game, I get as far as the loading screen and then get kicked out. This seems to be a very common issue, I wish the developers would listen to players and sort it out. I don't want to uninstall as I've spent time and money on it!"", 'The developers do not care about loyal players. The most recent update has a problem with their updated ""daily tasks"", and despite being made aware of the issue from multiple people, they are not doing anything to fix it. One person told me there were no plans to change the task, and another said the developers would consider my feedback ""going forward"". Long time players are being denied the chance to earn rewards, unless they spend over $100 to gem the upgrades needed to complete the task.', 'Great time management family game, unexpectedly addictive! Cute characters, great graphics, we love it - both me and my niece : ) Mesmerized by the Wizard Tower - so many details, like a feather-pen writing on its own, & many other cute things. I have to edit the above and say that the Panda island is rather boring. Very nice the last update Dec 2019, it makes the game more interesting.', ""So after last glitch it worked for a while, now it keeps freezing and undergoing my stuff. I've filmed and sent this boat three times, it's back. I am tired of using items to complete something, the task be undone, but my items aren't back. Why do you keep messing with code. I'm almost maxed anyways so guess I'm deleting. You keep crashing the game and tired of dealing with it"", ""Cute game however everything is too expensive. Now i haven't been able to get in for days. Prior to that it wasn't saving when completed tasks. Very disappointed as other games from this developer are awesome. Uninstalling."", 'I am enjoying this game. will play for a bit longer hoping for improvement many tasks take way tooo long to make or finish and of course the push for more magic and more rooms to complete in tower to finish a daily list increased If these things do no improve will probably move on for now I will play as on the whole nice game good graphics and clubhouse is improving with races', ""I absoutely love this game!! Graphics, music is incredible! The idea behind the game is great!

I havent been on my game for a week now i had to unstall the game just to play.. i was on 34, lost my game, cause the last update i couldnt get on it. So now i have to start all over again.. nice job', ""Really liked this game the last few weeks, but now it constantly freezes, and I have to close it out and reopen. Wouldnt be so bad, except it loses all progress I've made from the time I open it until it freezes and I have to redo everything when I open it again. Fix this please!"", 'Ive been playing for a good 2weeks and almost ready to uninstall. The game keeps freezing and causing me to close out when im in the middle of something. Then when i reopen i get something different. It takes forever to keep rebuilding all these buildings and decursing this tower!', 'I liked this game until I hit level 50. It just keeps saying ""coming soon"". None of the stars I am collecting are being counted so I cannot move forward in the game. Fix it!', ""There is NEVER enough water to get what you need to do done with it!! I personally find it ridiculous that it takes hours to produce a product. I like the concept of the game but I'm really thinking about deleting because I don't have the time it takes to wait."", ""It's a cute game. it doesn't require you to watch ads although it's an option. It's graphics are good like a cartoon. The only downside is that it's time consuming, but there isn't any penalty for missing out on tasks. You can start over the next day."", ""Pretty disappointed in this game. Was good when there was things to accomplish. It's been months since a decent update. Game just gets you going in circles. Maybe spend your time updating the things that matter not all the little stuff that nobody cares about!"", ""It was fun in the beginning but every new item I unlock takes longer and longer to make and it's killing the pace of the game. Also, there are so many quests involving magic, which takes a long time to collect too."", ""Christmas still in end of February? Machines are costing quite a lot and decursing the tower is getting ridiculous at room lvl 23. I purchase in-app charges, but don't make it be required at some point or you'll lose people."", 'December 12 2019, game worked fine until 2 weeks ago. Now it says no internet access or storage. Now i know my net is working and have plenty of storage on my phone but i cant play the game. I miss it. Please fix!', ""Having problems getting my whale to open so i can fill the orders, please send feedback to fix the problem. Well I'm now having the problems every one else is having, with the game freezing up and sayi g no connection with internet. I don't and will not start over."", ""I did like this game very much at one point. It's gotten boring now. Panda island take way too long to get the stuff you need to upgrade it and without upgrading panda island im stuck doing the same thing over and over..."", ""Not currently playable. Everytime I've started playing the past few days its freezes up my entire phone. It's my favorite go to game but I havent been able to play the past few days."", 'In the new quest to earn hearts, you make it too hard to get to the end to collect any hearts. Cause every time I jump and hit the obstacle in the air. Otherwise it would be fun.', 'The game is neat. The absolutely AWFUL customer service is not neat. Going on 3 months of asking for resolution for my account, with only a ""our team is working on it"" auto response. Having spent money on this, I\'m livid.', 'Having some trouble lately. I cant get pastthe loading screen then it pops up telling me I need internet connection, which I have, and more space, which I also have. Please fix!', 'Like the game but machines cost so much hard to buy them cause cant get enough money,everything needs potion and cant get enough potion machines gotta buy with gems hard get n e where in the game. I think stuff shld be lowered and not so high', 'Still one star. Waiting and waiting for one balloon to be fixed, no barrels to fill. Puts me at a big disadvantage . 12-11 no internet connection really right when we get all these new challenges, Everything is time sensitive and now this', 'Ok game but could do better with more storytelling. The only main problem is the extremely limited time you have to earn a key after sending three whales.', ""Nice game, you can meet a new friends in your team (Club House) its addicting game, stress reliever. I like this game..also it has a very cheap Price's of Gem's. Love it 😍"", ""Lovely game with beautiful graphics but since last update the pandas in the labrynthmore difficult to get only one occasionally so can't progress in panda island also still on 50 level so long so that does not motivate us give us more levels also not enough magic can't buy any new fountains even with gems so not enough magic for so many things we need it for almost everything so until this change I give it 4 instead of 5 stars"", ""This game is a sham. You can't progress or do ANYTHING without CONSTANTLY spending money. You upgrade and purchase more storage, and turn around and within minutes, need to pay for more storage. Stay away!!!!!"", 'I hate this game. They let you advance just enough to get interested and then gems are required to advance. You cant get enough gems without purchasing some. It sucks']"

I would definitely recommend this game for school aged kids too.', ""Interesting, though not very flexible. I enter many words that could fit but they were put on the side because that's not what had been pre-determined for a particular spot. That's frustrating. But I still keep on playing."", 'Great game for kids to learn words. Also great for adults to keep your mind working', 'This game really makes you think. Keeping the old mind sharp is wonderful. Thanks!', ""Nsmooth play. A few non standard words. Bit simple, but sometimes that's what you want.

I have not gotten a response/potential solution/even acknowledgement that they are looking into the issue. Used to be a regular game I played but with this crashing the game, renders the game essentially useless. I expected Some support.', ""I don't like the fact that I can accidentally lose my diamonds by mistake but have to tap on it twice when in the village to send someone away,I think you should have to tap twice to confirm that you really want to buy the item.

But, it feels like they do everything they can to make u buy diamonds, the more u upgrade ur storage for an additional 50 spaces the more they up the amount of needed items to upgrade again, and u will need to upgrade, but they never give u more then 50 spaces, it takes a very long time to get the items to upgrade unless u buy diamonds. If u find a great group like I have, that help each other u will enjoy playing, but the money it takes is crazy for the return on goods.', ""The game is okay all in all. Progress is painfully slow though. New production buildings are very expensive and it takes MONTHS to save up enough coins to buy the new buildings. Crafting items takes hours so I usually check the game once a day to see if anything is ready. If you spend real money on diamonds, you can speed things up but I don't like the game that much. The newest addition to the game, Valley Themes, doesn't add any enjoyment to the game for me. I can't figure out how to make any progress in this section of the game,so this section like the Neighborhood Derby, is not for me."", 'Game crashes at least twice during game play and despite being registered with supercell it doesnt save my most recent progress. Global events promise decorations but despite your efforts you dont get the decorations and when you ask you are told the global goal has not been reached. Decorations are rare and repetitive now unless you spend diamonds. I used to enjoy but now it is a bore with nothing to look forwards anymore. What a pity!', ""I've been playing this game since 2013, it's so addicting. I'm so happy to play it so far, but after the last update i found a lot of problems, such as it turn blank and suddenly closed when i tap my friends list. Then, the games transition from one farm to another farm is too long, so when u see the advertisement on newspaper, the product is always sold out. I think, all problems happen because my internet connection, but now i realized it doesn't. So, I hope hay day team will fix it! 😂"", ""I really enjoy this game. It's very addictive and I don't mind spending money occasionally to enhance the experience. However, since the last update, clicking on the friends and followers icon, bottom right, causes frequent crashes. It does this on my phone and tablet (both Android). I'm a level 96 as of this writing, so I have been playing for a while and this is the first time I have ever experienced game crashing. While the game is still playable, this recent issue has become annoying."", 'I love this app so much, it is fun filled and the animals are really FUNNY! The only problem is that you do not get the zoo until you are at a very high level. I love animals and it breaks my heart that I can not get the zoo soon, because I am only on level 14. Another bad part is that the foxes never come around I want to catch them! The game is really awesome though!!!', ""I love this game so much! I have been playing this game since so long. I never faced any problem. But from the last update, I'm not able to play properly, my game is freezing in just 4-5 minutes when i play and then my phone rebooted!

Doesn't load, freezes at Connecting, doesn't go any further, then it says no internet, uninstall and reinstall the game, still the same thing. Others at home can play it, except for me. Contacted support by email and no help at all. They just made me stupid questions and directed me to find help on the game. Pointless since the game doesn't load!!!"", ""I love playing this game, but after the new update the game keeps constantly stopping. It specifically stops when I'm trying to edit a layout. It also doesn't show your decorations that are stored.. Instead it shows a red square . Also the game seems to be much slower now after the update. Please fix this so I can go back to giving it 5 stars."", 'I love the game so far and it is alot of fun my only issue is the recent limit put on upgrading supplies for our barn and silo. In our neighborhood we all help each other and now we are limited to what we can do for one another.

But overall i have met wonderful new friends and enjoy being on the game talking and helping each other.', ""I thoroughly enjoy the game. After latest update numerous issues have surfaced; which I'm confident will be repaired. One particular issue I facing regularly is when loading the game. It will only load the game on a portion of my screen, leaving the remaining/majority of the screen a solid color often, but not exclusively, green. At which point I shut down the game and try to reload. Looking forward to these minor inconveniences to be fixed."", ""Maybe this will get someone's attention!! This has been a problem since the last update... I've been trying to figure out how to fix a crashing problem everytime I push the friends button. Sent an email... reply told me to go through the settings in the game. Went through the settings in the game... what a joke with the automated responses. That finally sent me a link which is another joke. Just need an actual person to acknowledge my problem and help me fix it. Please!"", ""I love this app! But it's been frozen for the last couple of days and I can't play it.😢 HELP my animals are starving! 🙃 Otherwise I would have given 5 stars. Edit to add that it seems to freeze up when developers are making changes to the game. For example the animals are still in winter wear for the holiday so it's frozen. When theyre done removing or changing the animal outfits it'll unfreeze. A bit annoying but I'll live. Still love it!"", ""I love this game and find it very addictive! I have been having troubke completing group tasks in the new animal rescue valley though. They don't see to appear at all and I feel like I'm missing out on chests because of it. I play all the time and try to stay up to date on it always so this is kind of dissapoining because I've even looked online and in not the only person it's happening to. Other than that one complaint though it's a fab game that will keep you entertained for hours!"", ""After the latest update I'm not able to access my friends' farms, keeps taking me out of the game at least 8 times within less than an hour which makes it really frustrating. My two boys have their own farms and they are facing similar problems with the farm loading every time they click to buy, help or visit a farm or even the neighbourhood. Please fix these problems which only occurred after the last update. Thanks"", 'Hi I\'m Lynnette. I would like to say that I really do enjoy haydays very much. It\'s a good wholesome game. However I have 2 problems, when I go to the ikon withe the 3 figures on at the bottom right of the screen it keeps throwing me out of the game. It\'s been like this since my last update, also everytime I want to buy something from the newspaper I always get the message ""sorry someone else has bought this"". It is really frustrating me that I don\'t want to play the game anymore. Thank you.', ""I absolutely love this game. I have had it well over 5 years. The past few months I've had problems with going to my fishing spot and looking in on my friends to help them out ( not to mention seeing what Greg has for sale).

Please look into."", 'I like to play hay day very much. The graphics are nice. But the problem is that I cannot open hay day. It shows connecting or loading and took very long time to open it. Even I want to buy things from my neighbour roadside stall, it took long time to open since it was being updated. Please do not add in limit 80 for tools for land expansion. Pls remove it. Painful for us.', ""I love this game! I've played for years. But since the last update I can NOT open my friends tab. Every time I try my game closes. This issue needs to be fixed immediately! The servers are down quite frequently, why is this not fixed? Please update and fix this issue.."", ""Started this game a couple months ago, I'm at level 46 currently. It's definitely a fun and addictive game, graphics are great and I love how the seasons change within the game (tree leaves changing from summer colors to fall). EDIT: (12-18-19) Game crashes constantly since most recent update. Do not like the limit on expansion tools, I have a very difficult time finding them all in the first place. Never get duct tape, but get absurd amounts of other barn/silo tools. Please fix this!"", 'I love how you can build, maintain, and design your own farm. It is so unique how you harvest products. I enjoy this game because I can interact with new people and play with family members. I have been wanting to comment one of my ideas that would add a creative sparkle to this wonderful game. Seems how you have trees you would have to wonder what to do with it, I would recommend a wood mill so you can put back in what you took out.', ""great game!! pop ups are minimal, and it truly is a free game (unlike so many others that claim to be). not really liking the valley update, too much downtime leading to missed deadlines. also lack of good instructions to perform tasks in the valley (such as helping fix truck and give chickens). the farming is awesome and i love the funny animals!! keep up the good work!! Update: the 'valley' isn't worth the effort, the rewards and downtime really ruin this part of the game.""]"

- Bug fixes and performance improvements","['I really enjoy the game. The right amount of balance between storyline and challenge is perfect. I am disappointed with the value of the game. To carry on with a game not to lose gears is 900 coins. This will give me 5 extra goes. To buy 1000 coins is 99pence. This is really expensive. Even the current Moonsale is 6.99. If this were the price of a coffee I would entertain it. Thanks for the game but please look at the intrinsic value in sales.', ""90% love the game. There's 2 things that drive me crazy: 1) I can get stuck on a level for dayssss and keep running out of lives and coin.. 2) I hate that the rockets are unpredictable. I haven't figured out their algorithm for which direction they'll turn when they run into each other. It's annoying and makes strategic play very difficult. I find this game to be a slow go, and what takes me a week or two to accomplish, is actually only 1 day in the life of Lily. Kinda dumb...."", ""I was enjoying this app until I reached a level that seems impossible to solve. I have been trying, literally for days. The game makes it difficult to get 3 wins to collect an item. I see no way to earn extra lives without buying them. The graphics of the people are horrid, especially Lily's facial expressions. I was having fun but now I am so frustrated that I'll be deleting the app."", ""I have spent a lot of money with this game. It has a cute plot, but your tools are far too expensive. 900 coins to carry on a single level? 1900 coins for 3 shovels and 3900 for 3 rakes. Give a person a chance. Your game is greedy. When you clear a level and have 40 moves left over and you give 86 coins? I'm going to spend my coins and uninstall. You should really reevaluate what you give and receive for this game."", ""I used to love this game but since the last update, it's way too hard. Maybe they were trying to throttle people back because they were too far ahead, maybe they're trying to boost revenue. At any rate, there are plenty of competitors in the same space that are offering similar games and I've downloaded three since this new update. I used to patiently wait for each new chapter, but I've gone through almost my entire store of boosts, plus purchasing extra lives. Too bad."", ""I see room for improvement, overall it's alright. I download yesterday. I'm not liking the fact, you only receive 1 star for every game. When designing requires more than one. It would be nice if once you start the game you got complementary stars, just to get started. The fact you need stars to talk to people., or to walk into the yard. Is a waste of stars. This game is going to take forever to even get started, so unfortunately I decided to go elsewhere. Best of luck to the developers."", ""Pretty good addictive game. Most levels are beatable without spending all of your earnings, but some levels that look impossible (676) are actually winnable without spending all of your prizes. The really tough levels just take a lot of tries and/or many different strategies to beat. The story line is actually interesting, which is ususual for these types of games. All in all, I'm enjoying this game a lot. I gave the controls four stars only because occasionally the wrong square gets selected."", ""I love this game! I play it every single day! As of right now, I'm on level 1957, and I've been playing so much I have 270 stars! Some of the levels are quite difficult, and sometimes it takes a lot of times to pass them, but there still so much fun! I also love the graphics and the decorations for the gardens, and I love the storylines! Great game!"", ""I love this game! It's easy enough for my granddaughter, age 9, to play and still is entertaining enough for adults. The graphics are great, and devs are always updating to make the game even better. I love Lily's expressions and the interaction between characters. Also, you don't have to spend $$ to advance. One of the major reasons I play this game. I give it a 5!! Keep up the good work!"", ""TOO MANY UPDATES!!! Each time I start the game, I get a pop-window telling there's an update. When I click update, I am sent back to the google play store to apply the update. The problem is that it continuously tells me to update everytime I start the game. This is becoming extremely annoying. Why so many updates??? The games seems to work well and it can get amazingly addictive but why so many updates? Unless there is a major problem, I can't understand why so many update notifications."", ""Love the levels and the story <3 I tried a few other of these type of games along the way and just found that there were absolutely impossible levels. I have probably bought coins 3 or 4 times but that's more for convenience and to see the next bit of the story (or at least that's what I am telling myself). I am rooting for you Lily!"", ""Very happy with how relaxing the levels are (with power boosters anyway). Usually, when trying to unwind for the day I have found certain games (gardenscapes, homescapes, matchington mansion etc...) will just wind you up, with every second or third level being rather difficult to pass even with power boosters. Not that I don't mind difficulty, it is just when you want to escape into a fantasy world, only to find it as frustrating as the real world is, can be exhausting."", 'Awesome game. Relaxing and fun. Only downfall is you acquire 3 hours of free play and your time is used up whether you play or not. Would be nice to be able to keep a fraction of that time banked for next log on. I do understand though, because game could be completed way to quickly if free play time was saved. Would recommend to everyone.', ""I'm the type of person to download games that I think that I would love and after a few days stop playing it completely. This game in particular in my opinion is great. I have had it for several months and have not gotten bored with it. Sometimes I have gotten frustrated because I will run out of lives doing certain levels but I love that it can be challenging at the same time. It makes me think my garden is that much more beautiful. I never even leave reviews on games. Highly recommend!"", ""I absolutely love this game and it has a great story line. I would give it 5 stars if didn't cost so many coins for extra moves or boosters. Maybe we could earn more coins when we get to higher levels that would be great! I'm in the 1500's and still earn the same as if I was on level one. I do understand that that's how y'all get people to spend their money on the game and I have. But I do think that the higher levels should earn more."", 'Great game. The higher levels of gameplay take forever to complete. My only frustrating issues are it takes days (2) to finally pass a level. The thought of only able to have a limit of lives(5) is NOT workable for levels. But, I really like storyline, and decorating the Hotel. Will continue playing for now.', 'Love it!! No problems so far! Yay!! /Still love this game!! Have deleted other games cuz they just dont hold my interest like this one does. Challenging,fun,funny,witty i could go on but the game speaks for itself. Kudos to everyone at Tactile for another awesome-tastictal game. Thank you for making my sleepless nights less boring!!', ""I love this game. I don't even like matching games (candy crush style), but I actually enjoy this. My only complaint is I wish there was an infinite storyline, lol! The storyline is fabulous, the garden options are beautiful and fun, the whole game is engaging and addictive."", 'Great other then the slow login process . Takes too long to load the game somwtimes which frustrates me an then alot of times I exit out of the game because the waiting for it to load process takes longer then someone would like to wait especially when you only have a little bit of time between work etc. To play. Also how hard some levels are to get the stars to complete each task. been stuck on same level for a month steers me into not playing. Should give us other ways to earn stars for tasks', ""I like this game. Not too hard but the soap opera parts between puzzles gets a bit annoying after a while... Discovered you can skip these bits, which is nice. Something else that's VERY ANNOYING is when you get unlimited lives for half an hour, you either play for the next half an hour or you lose them. Even if you pause the game the unlimited period of time continues"", ""I'm completly hooked! This is my go to game for relaxing and helping my anxiety. The ONLY thing I wish was diffent is how the unlimited lives time still runs when you aren't playing it. For someone with chronic fatigue and other illnesses it's a bit frustrating cause I can't play for hours (ex: 2+ hours of free unlimited play) straight... Maybe try to help those who have the same issues because of health and or schedules. (4 out of 5 stars for now as Philip says 😉 )"", 'Some levels are impossible without spending money, harder levels should earn more stars and star spending should be revised eg to start and finish a day and to initiate a task them you have to spend more stars to complete task. Its a great game and i love the choices but some things need to change for me to give 5 stars.', ""At first I would have given a 5 star review. It's fun. I'm now almost to level 200 and it takes 3 days to move one level. I'm doing this for fun. 3 days to move one level is not fun. Please change so the higher levels are not so annoying. I want to have fun. Will be deleting the app soon"", ""I enjoy this fun little game, both the puzzle and the story. I am on day 11 and plan to keep going. I kind of wish I could save infinite lives for when it is convenient to me like I save tools, but that may be a point. Good diversity of characters and plot development, does not push real buying too much, don't feel like I need to pay to win. Nice game."", ""Fun game, but incorrect info is given about how Nature actually works, therefore the dialog is often quite stupid sounding. And they make men out to be really foolish, which is disappointing. And don't get me started on how ridiculous the feminist conversations are!!! It's a shame the characters are made to look so dumb, because game play and graphics are quite fun."", 'I love this game. At times it can be very challenging to complete a level, sometimes it takes several times ( or 20) to get it but like any game that\'s the enjoyment of accomplishing it. My only complaint is that I feel like the ""hard"" levels should be worth at least 2 stars. Also it would be nice to be able to pause your infinite lives time.', ""This game has beautiful art and a storyline that isn't too bad, the only issue is how obviously rigged the matching is. I can go from the start to the end of a level without getting anywhere closer to my goal because every single matchable set is the wrong color, or they're all on the other side of the map from the goal, etc. The way they fall sometimes is intentionally checkered because, you only have to match 2 so why not make that impossible. I also don't like spending do much on talking"", 'Love this game. Levels are challenging but doable. Like the rewards of unlimited lives for a certain time to play and the storyline is interesting and adultlike. Well done all. Please keep the new chapters coming and if you make more games like this I will keep coming back for more. A quick update. Since I finished the previous existing levels, I wait in anticipation for the weekly update which I finish in a couple of days. Please update more often or give us longer play time week.', ""Funny but I don't like that you have no control over the directions of the torpedoes. If you figue out which 5 blocks go together so you can get a torpedo, you should have the ability to shoot it whichever way you choose. Seems like the game cheats and always shoots it the opposite way you need to clear the board. That's frustrating."", 'I love the game . I hate that you have to pay 900 for 4 extra plays. And more money to purchase help. I also play another game that I love and it is the same thing. I am on disability and on a tight budget. Some days I have to spend almost 8 hours to win a game because I refuse to spend anymore money.', ""Edited Feb 21,2020 add one star only bc I like this game and it has potential but having to wait so long for lives to restore is ridiculous! The option to use special items like bombs, etc DURING gameplay would be great! I also noticed that if you are interrupted (example: phone call, text, any notification) and you have selected a powerup you lose it even if you HAVEN'T STARTED THE GAME! Completely unfair especially when these are items you EARN for winning and putting your time into this game!"", ""It's an ok game. Good premise but I have only been playing a couple of weeks and already the levels take a couple of days to pass. Obviously they control when you pass because all at once all of the plays you need to pass happen. Would be a great game if it wasn't for that. I read several reviews with the same thoughts so only play if that kind of thing doesn't bother you. With your reply, you obviously don't even read the reviews. I am not stuck on one level, was giving a review on the whole g"", 'Love the game, its storyline, and how often I can get unlimited lives. However, recently the game has been glitching really bad, almost like when a DVD gets scratched. Today it completely crashed while I had 2 hours of lives left and told me it was closing. It has been like this for a couple of weeks, but I figured it would get fixed with the last update.', ""I like the puzzles, but can we get more tasks related to fixing up the garden and building, as well as have more customized options? Feel this game puts too much focus on the main character's love interest and relationships, which I personally don't care about and don't want to spend stars on...especially when I need to spend 1 star just to talk to one person."", 'I love this game, especially since my daughter\'s name is Lily. I enjoy the level challenges and appreciate the concept better then the ""Homescaped/ Gardenscaped"" game even though I think it\'s the same creators. Just wish the game was both garden and house for fixes and design. (Thus the entire property, not just one or the other) Thanks for a great game that doesn\'t rely heavily on ""friend"" game play.', 'Need stars to build ""garden"". You only get 1 star for each level you beat, even the difficult ones and some garden activities take up to 3 stars. Some of the matching levels takes DAYS to beat and, still, only 1 star. Then you have to wait for lives to replenish to play on. Either give us 2-4 stars per level or unlimited lives or just SOMETHING to make it worth even continuing to play. Would be a good game otherwise. At this point it\'s just annoying and frustrating.', ""Was fun to start with but then it gets boring, because it starts to be like a pay to win game, get stuck on levels for ages, and some of the normal levels are harder than the hard levels, it also slows down and freezes my phone, I have xperia xz2 so a decent phone, don't have trouble with other games like it, another problem I have is, I start a level and sometimes the level ends straight away not even able to make a move and of course that's a life lost"", ""I have to say, yes I'm old but I've built websites, games n such n this game doesnt have the ads, the constant wanting money popups and the tunes used are really sweet. No loud booms, just calm n well developed. I am constantly looking for something relaxing and this game is it. Several I've even was bored with skipping the story n I find myself reading everything! This actually reminds me of growing up around my uncle harry who taught me the hive business . Beautiful game❣ Thank you!!"", ""I absolutely love this game! The only reason I'm giving it 4 out of 5 is because the levels are getting too difficult. I've never spent more than 2 days on a level, but I'm on level 920 for at least a week now. The blocks are not lining up at all to collect the flower pots. Plus I've had issues where some of the required objects to collect aren't even on the board such as the butterflies and fuzz balls. If they aren't there to collect, how can I pass the level?? Fix this problem please!!!"", ""(UPDATE) STILL PLAYING! Also they're pretty generous with the level prizes. I really thought this would be some poorly written plumb pitiful story game and booring to boot. FINALLY I tried it and it's my new favorite game!!! I even actually READ the story lines as they unfold and can't wait to to get to what happens next. Beautifully illustrated, addictive, fun and did I already say addictive?""]"

I have some that have never played... I hope you change this policy...."", ""Poor Support. When I have had problems with this game and submitted a ticket, if they respond, the response has never provided a solution.

And, it's impossible to play tournaments if you want the best rewards without spending real world $"", 'I am enjoying this game most of all the cooking games. It has a lot of content, without giving you too much to keep up with. I especially like the special decoration sets, which keep your restaurant decor changing without spending all your funds. Getting gold to expand can be a bit slow, but I am almost level 100 and have not had to spend real funds to play the game.', 'Awesome app! I like how there is hardly ever any ads, I don\'t feel pressured into using real money. One thing I don\'t like is these ""hints"", where it asks you to buy stoves, counters etc, or ""cook this dish now"" which is annoying when I already know what to do. I love the quests and one thing I wanna know, how come it is limited to five gifts a day? I also like the fact I can befriend someone without being their Facebook friend.', 'I so like this game. It is relaxing. Although one thing I dont like is when your decorating and the item just goes to one place and you either have to drag or tap the item until it goes to the place you want to place it.

Like before, my suggestion is to add customizable characters where we can change their hair, eyes, clothes and add accessories."", 'I lost over 300 in cash buying the extra task when the tournament started too early. I have sent in several request to get it back but have had no responce. That is alot of money to just have taken away due to a game error. NEW RATING IS LESS THAN 1 POSSIBLE?

More vending machines would be nice. Add more ways to earn expansion vouchers also add more expansions. More gifts to send friends.

This is my 4th day on this game and never will I purchased anything else while playing this game."", ""Really love the game! My only issue is that one has to pay for the floor tiles individually, instead of just purchasing the tile pattern once, like in previous games I've played. Other than that, the gameplay is fun and fast paced and I really like all the different challenges and competitions, the drops and vouchers-- great job guys!"", ""I truly enjoy and am totally addicted to this game. My only issue is I think the cooking times should be reevaluated. Especially when it comes to catering. It is crazy to try to fill an order in 6 hrs when the dish you have to master needs 150 servings and takes 4hrs a serving to cook. Even if you had 10 stoves cooking at once you couldn't fill that order."", ""I love this game, you don't have to spend money like most games, you will sooner or later get the stoves and stuff you need if you play free, just take your time and enjoy cooking at your speed and level, a little advice when you play, get the online order machine, you'll want at least 10 stoves before opening the online order machine, save your cash dollars for your quests, also be careful on what you tap, or you'll accidentally spend your hard saved cash on something. Well Made Game For Me."", 'Please have more side games like farming some special ingredients or decorating the front of the cafe and more inter-active such as having a like button of the desire cafe with a beautiful layout please also update the buyable items in the store the game have a lot of potential and lately is getting boring just having to cook and entering to a group competition.', ""Good game but this glitch has really pissed me off and it's happened several times now.

Due to this the star rating for vending machines has reduced. And, the tournament task of filling 44 machines cannot be completed. Please correct this. Either increase the limit of vending machines or reduce the number of vending machines to be filled in the task. It's not fair that you guys reducing the vending machine limit for no reason."", 'Enough things to keep me interested, chances to earn great gifts..you can buy bucks at good prices but not necessary to progress. Easy enough to level up, if you put in the work, but not to hard. Smooth game play. This is one of my daily games.', ""I get that money needs to made & I do spend money, I would spend more EXCEPT for the reasons in previous reviews. If I'm going to spend my money for CL cash I want to use that to make my game more enjoyable for me not so I can complete required tasks.

I already tried to contact, but nothing's happened yet😢"", ""I have mixed feelings about this game. If you have enough RAM to play the animations, the animals are well rendered and enjoyable. The play is slow with lots of waiting unless you want to pay a fortune. And that's the real problem. Other than buying diamonds with cash, there are few ways to get more than 1 or 2 a day. It can take a month to earn what you need for a single new animal or shop. The cost is WAY too unreasonable and the wait for cards for free stuff becomes too long as you advance."", ""I'm at level 20 and still liking this game a lot. Excellent animation, with complex programming for animals, so they use the whole enclosure, no matter what size and shape you make it, how you arrange the things you put inside it, or how many animals you put in it. Their movement is mostly quite lifelike and appropriate for the species, too. Be sure to use the Wiki files - they help a lot. Breeding should have better odds for success. Rotating the view could be improved."", ""It is an AMAZING game but it's can be laggy and personal opinion I think the music is copyrighted but I don't know. Apart from tiny glitches now and again it's one of my favourite games! If the games gets more things that aren't great then I ma have to sadly delete the game but i hope not because I have a lot of progress in the game!"", ""This game is fun! But it does get really hard to get enough coins as everything gets more expensive. And the only way to earn diamonds is to watch ads. You only get 1 diamond per 10 ads you watch. Upgrades are expensive. It's less fun now,and all the employees cost diamonds every week to keep them, and it's not even reasonable. This needs fixed"", ""It's really fun and all, but it takes such a long time to get more visitors! The only problem l have is that they keep urging me to get new habitats which works fine when you're trying to attract visitors, but l don't have where to put them. So, if u want me to get visitors, give me more space. Otherwise, super fun, graphics are great, stories are fun, l like it"", 'I love this game. But theys a problem with the amount of diamonds u need I tried breeding one of my animals to the total of 20 times it was unsuccessfull until I used some diamonds to help and low and behold it was successful. I think the diamond really needs to be looked out the amount u pay to what u receive or scrap the diamonds only have them for the special items. This really needs looking at for to continue playing', ""The most interactive game I've played in quite some time , I love all the options of goals to reach and their rewards, I'm not crazy about the number of things that require diamonds which need to be purchased; for a free game it's costing me alot. Due to the expense involved this game is not for everyone."", 'Great game at first. Some of the tasks are a bit silly like placing one animal to recieve one as the reward. Most animals and shops are to pricey as cost gems which are hard to get. If it was to easy nobody would play it but think need to reconsider the amoints per item/animal. I also think you should be able to zoom out more so can see better.', 'Love the game ...but way to much of the land and animals are blue gems that really you have to buy as you do not get that many for free ..so the land you can buy can not join up with the main land unless you use blue gems and boy like i say cost way too much shame really i would say a lot of people would leave this game', 'It takes HALF A FREAKING MILLION POINTS to level up. It takes a week or more. Im on level 57 still have half my quest unfinished because you need dimonds and it takes so many points to level up. That is so stupid. If people stop purchasing the dimond bundles they will decrease the price or give us more for rewards. I wish we could exchange coins for dimonds Also deleted my friends because they didnt play for months and never leveled up and now i cant get new friends.', ""I was loving this game.. Was great to pass time but the further you got into the game the more difficult it was to complete requests.. Silly amounts of gems to pass levels 100 gems for 1 request! You don't even have an option to win gems... So all in all of you want to progress any further than level 29 upwards in this game be prepared to spend your own money or you won't get very far! Really disappointed that I've had to delete the app as I was getting no where with it"", ""Hai! Im here to report saying this is a 5 star game! I've played this for about a year! I dont understand why people dont like this game because it is super fun! I love how you get to make baby animals! Its so cute. Whenever i play i always have a smile on my face! I hope this has helped you? Thanks for your time reading this! ❤😄"", '5 stars for overall concept & style (adorable animals!!!)...BUT 1 for variety/availability/random-ness of items plus AWFUL cost ratios, unrealistic promo length/prizes, quests give disjointed rewards & often require expensive/locked items (MANY levels too early) 2 for consistent issues (severely limited zoom-out can\'t show large sections/""big picture"", poor menu design/nav, really bad 360 spin function, glitchy animation/translation 3 for human characters/storylines + LOTS of animal inaccuracies', ""Love the game, have been playing for a year but like others feel the diamonds are too much. The diamonds required are too expensive ( 288 to upgrade some shelters) you keep saying you can get diamonds for finishing quests but I can't finish most breeding quests now (level 65) because I need diamonds to upgrade.

I lose money also and never get it back! Please fix the problem!', 'The game is engaging and nice but your ticketing system wont work for upgrades necessary to breed many animals and it is ridiculously overpriced like requiring 228gems for upgrading lvl3 mountain shelter and a lot of quests got stuck due to this. Change upgrading method to coins for everything so that we can progress in the game', 'I love this game so much. Its so much fun, im constantly rearranging everything. Im always spending money on the instore shop. But to make this game even greater than it already is would add more shops to buy with coins preferably. But more shops would help out a lot.

I can't wait 2 get the more exotic animals. I love the 🐼 If ur children think they are ready 2 own pets, get them 2 play this game first."", 'Love the game but agree with most other users that the diamond requirements are ridiculous and way to much.

I still remember the first time i played this, i wasnt sure if i'd like it or not but INSTANTLY i fell in love of this game The thing i dont like tho is that i dont do halloween and i always skip the events tho but i try to do them bc i want the animals XD This game is good too bc u have responsibilities like real life. I dont care if ppl hate it"", 'I love this game but the diamond prices and amounts are unreasonable and kinda rediclious u need them to really be able to fully accomplish things u can get them for free but only if you watch 10 videos witch takes way to long you can also get them if you complete missions again ok but you usally need them to complete the missions or it takes forever to complete them witch is again rediclious but it is a fun game it would be way better and way more fun if the diamonds were Easier to get', 'Excellent zoo game in play store.Now I m at level 26.Most of d item & animal need to purchase with 💎.Quest r gives low 💎.As you told, many ways gives only one 💎.But 💎requirement is very very high in game.

Otherwise this game is fun. 😊👍"", ""this game is frustrating because you can't zoom out for a birds eye view so rearranging is a challenge. boring with no daily or weekly events/challenges except sales events. Decor is lacking not enough choices. extremely sad that we have not had a valentine's event yet and it 3 days away! ready to quit playing! Had to update app and now it won't load! I also think the diamonds are hard to earn. The tickets for exotic animals are non existent unless you spend $ I've spent hundreds on this game."", 'I like it, but takes way too long to earn money, and all the good animals must be purchased with diamonds, which basically means you have to pay for them. A few changes to that would make the game more playable', 'Not worth it. Another game which you have to pay to play once you get past something ridiculous like 6 levels or watch non stop ads in the hope you eventually get one gem (note starting buy you need 10) not worth the download. Do NOT recommend', ""I dont have a lot of time to spend on games but I do have time to check in for 10 minutes several times a day - so this game is perfect for that.

Few every time you level up. It would be nice to have another way to grab these diamonds or even take them off from buying the lands. A diamond spin wheel something to help get the diamonds up to help your players stay in the game would be nice', 'WOULD NOT RECOMMEND!!!! Too many quest requires animals or objects that cost diamonds, which means I cant really progress in the game without spending actual money. Need to either change the animals and objects to where they cost the money from the game instead of diamonds which cost actual money.', 'Glitches need to be fixed, my diamonds and baby animals have been disappearing even though I know I have used or moved them. This is frustrating and disappointing. Otherwise I really enjoy the game', 'I like this game! Theres ways to get stuff without spending money, like with the puzzle pieces. Definitely one of the better games that dont let you get anywhere.', 'Cool to see the cute animals that play , eat , and make the zoo complete. The animals are cool to watch at times they will play or eat. You get more animals as you go on with the game. The more animals your zoo has the more people will go there and it will then be more complete the zoo is simple at first but as you play the zoo will becume extreme . You can make your zoo bigger and get more space of your own proprty by playing to that point in the game. The zoo and animals are amazing']"

It seems I always get stuck on a level that seems impossible, stop playing for a bit, then when i try again I'm suddenly able to beat it easily- wonder if that is by design to keep you playing. Also what is with ALL of playrix games and their ads not reflecting the gameplay at all?"", ""Two months later, I'm still on level 110. Boosters are so useless that there's no point buying them, which is a strange business move. I wish levels could be completed with skill, instead of dumb luck and repeating each level 10+ times. Pay to win, and you will eat through power ups very quickly if you don't play games like these very often. You need to be pretty skilled and experienced to be able to scrape your way through. I'm not sure why this game values quick money over long term players."", ""Great game. Starting to get really challenging.its getting better and better, I love the way there are so many ways to match and cause big bangs. Have come back to this game and wow just wow. It has been upgraded and updated. It looks much slicker and the graphics are chunkier, if that makes sense. Really enjoying it and I'm enjoying setting up the zoo. There is so much going on ,that after purchasing something new , I like to check in on the elephants, lions etc. Keep up the great work ."", ""Fake advertising. Here in the pictures that are supposed to be from the game, it shows that the player needs to help the animals throughout different tasks and situation. Since I have been searching for such a game for a long time, I downloaded. Upon opening, surprise! It's a match 3. I would have give it less than a star. Unfortunately I can't."", ""I love this game so much but each time I load it, the screen is frozen and you can't move the pieces. Shut down my phone many times but it doesn't make a difference. This is since the recent update..please sort it out, I'm starting to lose interest in this app. Shame :( .. No response from creators.... rubbish service, ALSO messaged Support Team as suggested and again... NO RESPONSE! Awful service. Don't install. Total waste of time and phone space!"", 'This would be a really good game except for the fact that after a certain level you end up playing the same level at least 20 times over before you can beat it and move on, at which point you have to play the next one as many times. I understand no one wants to breeze through every level without some challange but, you dont want it so ridiculously hard that it takes days to beat a normal level.', ""Love it- BUT - you have to give up TOO MANY diamonds (180) for 5 extra moves and if you need just 1 more move you have to give more diamonds (240) and so on 😡. So when you run out of diamonds you have to buy at the play store or buy things (decorations) that the cost is usually high and only get 10, 20 or 30 diamonds. How many do I need to buy to be able to reach at least 180? Finally u run out of all kind of money and can't play no more 😔. Needs change in that."", ""Its been amazing so far being 4 days into the game ... I gave it 3 stars because i came to stage 42 and i can't progress further on in my journey and keeps telling me more levels are coming soon.

The animals are funny and adorable and you can NOT stop playing. I also love your 2 other games Homescapes and Gardenscapes. THANK YOU PLAYRIX!!!', ""This game is so fun, I love how the things you buy are better than just using 8 stars to clear some rocks like on gardenscapes. However, i got to game 54 and I'm only rated a 6 star zoo and the game wont let me play. It just says more levels coming soon, which is really annoying because i just earned my 3 hours of infinity lives, but i can't use it because there aren't more levels. Disappointed, but I'll wait to see if its fixed and change my rating then!"", ""Starts out great. I think it's going to be different from Homescapes and gardenscapes. It gives good money and items are priced accordingly then I hit level 21 and boom just like I guess all Playrix games are it becomes impossible to beat and prices go up. Come on lads give us a break."", ""Reading all the nice reviews about the game. Download due to liking the match 3 games. For some reason at level 44 it stops me and says more levels coming soon. It shows I'm connected to fb but can't see anyone else that plays or go back and look at levels. Can't ask for lives from fb friends and not showing anything that others are saying in the reviews. Only got to play 2 days. Also there are no updates for me to do."", 'First when I played I liked the game so much that I really got interested and started playing , but then after certain levels it got very difficult and tough to complete the levels ...still I would like to continue the game but, because I am not able to complete the level I am disappointed .

I have to uninstall sorry due to running out of space ...this game has a total of 50+ animal families ,on my tablet i only have 12gb, half that is to house preinstalled apps ,that you cant delete to make more space. Sorry i only got up to the white fox family and wont see how hame ends.😞', 'I need help. My game had a glitch while making a purchase. Forgivable. So I deleted the game and redownloaded it. All my decorations and level progress was restored but the ""store"" is showing that I haven\'t earned access to a TON of stuff that I already accessed and purchased. All this stuff is showing in my zoo! So clearly I earned them and purchased them. I hate that its saying I need to earn them again to move foward. I am so confused and frustrated.', 'Ite fun until the later stages when it becomes a PIG . be WARNED it will pull you in with fun and some tricky levels but after you past that lovely peak you\'ll find levels that have had ABSOLUTELY ZERO thought or design , just levels that are literally impossible and where the bounces work against you. The only game of the ""scapes""i would not recommend!', 'Disappointing. Could be a great game, however the difficulty with which it takes to progress is unnecessary. Each level feels like a grind and the ""easy"" levels don\'t feel that evenly distributed among the harder ones. I have been on a certain level for well over 1 month now and often i am not even close. Power ups are surprisingly ineffective and I have no other choice but to remove. I would purchase boosts but the play value for the money spent would be zero. Shame.', 'It was a great game until i reached level 17. Now the game keeps telling me more levels are coming soon and I am still stuck with no updates to when the new levels are coming out. Great game, just wish i could have played past level 17.', 'Till yesterday I was able to play level 23. Starting this morning I am able to play level 23 on this game and getting message like "" New levels are coming soon"". Seema this is a bug in the game. Can you please look into this issue.', ""I was really getting to like this game! I guess i played all levels already because the game keeps telling me new levels will arrive shortly! I guess I'll have to wait a couple of days until they upload new levels! Very annoying!!!!"", ""Typical Playrix game. The RNG for pieces makes it so you have to keep replaying puzzels until you get one you can actually beat, without spending real money on their boosters. Spent $1.99 on boosters to try and beat the one I am currently on. It was a total waste of money. Even with the boosters, I still couldn't beat it. It just would not give me pieces that I could match. Already sick of this game. It is nothing but doing the same puzzels over and over, until the RNG lets you beat them."", ""I love the graphics and I love how the game gives you gems and coins by completing tasks. This game is challenging but is also fun. I think the game could have a few more animals in each part that you complete like hippos, manatees, hyenas stuff that people don't always get to see in a zoo. I also think it would be fun if you guys would put in fun facts about each animal."", 'At first I loved this game and got really into building my zoo, but as I progressed, the levels got ridiculously hard so gems must be spent to progress. I bought gems a few times, but used them up quickly. I\'m currently on level 165 and have attempted it 100+ times but haven\'t come close to beating it. Deleting this app as I dislike being forced into paying for a ""free"" game.', 'Originally i gave it a four. But now its hard to play for some reason. I have a hard time moving anything on the screen and when it finally does move, it moves in the opposite direction. Theres no update available and i dont have issues with any other games, so its not my phone. Will be uninstalling!', ""I have loved this game up until now. There is a 4 day tournament to win trophies that won't allow you to win coins. I got this game because of being able to buy things for the zoo to build it. If these kinds of things start coming up more, I will get rid of it. I don't need, nor want another version of Candy Crush! Note: I have NEVER spent money on this game and I am almost to level 900 so it is POSSIBLE to win in it."", ""I absolutely love their other title, Township and have played it for years. This game is a piece of garbage 😠😡😑. Just when you think you're about to win, the game changes it's mechanics and you lose unless you pay for diamonds. Bigger ripoff than Candy Crush!"", ""Love it, Its definitely cute and can be challenging. I'm waiting for more levels. Please make more asap. I didnt realize this game was so new, at first I thought I hadn't finished something to unlock more levels."", ""Love this game!! I've played Township for several years, so I feel so at home with this game. All the cute Lil characters are so familiar and already like a part of the family. Thanks Playrix for another amazing game. I hope you turn the restraunt event into a game as well. 😍"", ""I'm on level 528, so it is possible to advance at least that far, but I've spent lots of money and continue to get frustrated. This game is addictive, but it's BEYOND DIFFICULT! I'm going to have to quit, cause I've spent too much real money on level 528, and I still can't beat it. Please update the game to be easier, or this paying player has no choice but to quit."", ""This like with every other match 3 game on the market they recommend move after move until you have no more moves left I'm not quite sure if this is part of the algorithm to make it more challenging or to make it more frustrating, It's as if they want you to uninstall their game. Also constant issues, boosters not working. They have enough people downloaded no need to address issues."", 'In an age of instant gratification, perseverance is a lost skill. This game rewards that skill, as every level is possible eventually. I am addicted! I have one complaint: part of the strategy of this game includes using power ups to help you finish your goals, however the spinning tops are not useful at all. Often when I use one on my last move to finish the game it goes to some random useless square and not the goal, as it does in Homescapes and Gardenscapes. Please make these more useful :)', ""Even though its good but sometimes it's lagging then when the levels are too easy the hard ones are very hard sometimes I don't really like cause of the moves, when easy it has lot of moves when hard it has a little moves what the heck man.... 😡😡😡Please don't install.. 🙏🙏"", ""The levels continue to get more difficult and some can't be done unless you spend money. Level 172 can't be won. Maybe if you bought the most expensive package of helps but there is no way you can get all 3 umbrellas even if you purchase more turns. I'll miss playing this game. It was fun at first but now it is too expensive and too frustrating."", ""I would give it five stars, but the goodies that you get from special matches don't help you. They go in the opposite direction from where you need them to go. What's the point of making them, when they absolutely don't help. I have updated to three stars, most of the goodies help gameplay, except the match four tops. They just don't go where you need them to. I don't believe this is a technical error, but a developer error. Everything else is great. I would love to give five stars if fixed."", 'Typical Playrix offering. You would think after two similar games - Gardenscapes and Homescapes - the developers would have learned a thing or two. Nope. They still do not know the fundamental difference between challenging and downright impossible. Oh and don\'t believe that pap in their canned answers about ""every level is feasible"". Sure it is - if you don\'t mind spending 6 days playing the same level over and over till the RNG ""allows"" you to win. Uninstalled after 50 levels.', ""The ideas behind this game are nifty, but the execution is horrible. Read the other reviews for confirnation. The powerups behind this game are inconsistent - the clear-all, the candy box, will fire if touched by other pieces, removing the ability to create setups. Sodas sometimes pierce obstables and sometimes don't, and you are taught early on to rely on tops to reach distant goals, but will find that the top AI will frequently hit random pieces while goals still exist. Skip this game."", 'Another pay to play. Hey dev, check your data to see the amount of people that no longer play after cotton candy levels. Regeneration is the most frustrating thing ever. Scrap it to see all of your numbers go up.', 'Disappointing seems to be a great game but keeps crashing when trying to open, this is my 8th try today at trying to open and play this game. I have already spent nearly £19.00 to buy extras but cannot access these benefits due to freezing!', ""I find it interesting that today after buying a pack and buying the piggy bank, I've used everything just to try to beat a level that I just can't get passed. I'm not spending more money after 3 purchases the game gets unpassable."", 'I cant open this game it says I need internet which I have dont know what is wrong..thanksI have the game now and was doing just fine but I am on level 80 and cant seem to get passed.

Unique heroes will join you as the game progresses, including the Commander who is good at counterattacks, the Sorceress who is able to melt enemy armor with flames, the Paladin who enhances troop morale and brings blessings, and the Oracle who helps you improve luck in battle. However, the speed with which you recruit and train them greatly affects your troops' combat performance and strategy abilities!

⚔️Cross-Server War
You’re free to sign up for this war every two weeks to compete with alliances from different servers around the world. In this event, you can invade your opponents’ Stronghold on other servers to conquer them and plunder spoils, thus ranking top in the event and winning handsome rewards!

⚔️The Stronghold Fighting Day
Players can participate in the Stronghold event every week. With the occupation of the rare Stronghold, the alliance not only wins glory, but also enjoys the privileges it brings, including resource protection, units upgrade, combat protection, and other special features. Also, the strong alliance buff and rich weekly spoil rewards will help your alliance gain an advantage!  

⚔️War of Throne
It is an event where you need to occupy the Blood Palace and activate the Dark Tower to attack the Royal City with your allies! The alliance leader who wins the war will become the King, enjoying privileges and wielding supreme power!  

⚔️Various Alliance Events
Varieties of alliance events are waiting to be explored, such as Arena, Cave team-up, Pappas’ Treasure, Spirit Orb Collection, Hunting event, etc. These events require both strength and collaboration, and you’ll get great rewards to help you grow faster!

Once all that is taken into consideration, this game would be a right fit for you.', 'Lively strategy game with lots to do, though inevitably based round the build, research, train routine. One problem early on is finding an alliance. There is little choice as they mostly require a certain power level. Also, you reach level 6 quickly and lose beginners shield - replacements are unaffordable, so you are wide open to attack by stronger players.

Increase the rewards and there should be way to buy old equipment even if there is new verison of weapon .

Change this model and allow users to get more rewards then more people will join', ""I was playing this game for points on another platform but it's just so unbearably awful that I'm not going to be able to complete the task required by the platform to even get any points. While there are some graphical glitches that require a restart of the app from time to time, the real reason that I am probably going to remove the app from my phone is how crappy the player base is and how painfully boring the game play gets the higher your level becomes. I started dreading game play so yeet."", ""If you feel like losing money, then try this game. People here have spent thousands of dollars just to keep up with stats. It is never ending. Every mobile game uses the same formula to attract players, relies on you to gamble your money to build faster , in the end the player doesn't win at all. I'm a strong hold 40 with multiple castles and doesn't matter. Koa never gave me award or recognition for my time.1 year gone Fun, Addictive @ 1st but regrets later on.."", 'KOA differently is an addictive game to play. My The only downfall is that it always ask you pay in order to be competive and if you do its not enough for the amount of money you put in so your steadily buying (19.99, 9.99, 49.99 and 89.99) at least times to update one gear. if you rent the monthly payment of 29.99 (but you can cancel anytime) its okay with a lot of debate against it. I give this game 4/5 for the game play, and 2/5 for payments, overall rating 3/5', ""Great game but way to many promotions in everything that you do. It becomes a nuisance to where you really don't want to play it. You have way to many things in your HUD items and it blocks the screen from you seeing anything. They need to have each section retractable towards the sides and out of the display individually so that you can see and use what you need and not just click a button and EVERYTHING is gone. I took a chance and bought some bundles and found the rewards are fair."", 'What is the problem with KOA? Pay to win? NO. p2w ups the stakes. this game is super expensive and addictive, but if you are smart and put in a lot effort, you can beat players that spend a lot more, it makes it challenging and more satisfying, just stay within your means. Bullies? NO. Stronger players can kill you at any time its true. You need to be smart. Its easy to protect your castle without spending anything. Again, this just makes it challenging. Easy games are boring! Cheating? MAYBE. There are a lot of reports of cheating. In my experience there was no obvious cheating in my kingdom, it doesn\'t mean it doesn\'t happen though. Just not common. Support? YES. Support is absolutely terrible. You start by training 100s of troops at a time, after months of playing you can train 1000s. After about 6 months you might be able to train 500k troops. Then one day there will be a glitch in the system and they will all DISAPPEAR. support does absolutely NOTHING. They just send standard responses that there was no error. This is a game were people spend hundreds, thousands, or more. But at any moment a glitch will make your items or troops disappear. KOA does nothing. I know so many stories of this happening. I was king of my kingdom and had spent 1000s, 442k troops disappeared and they did nothing. Hundreds of dollars worth of stuff gone because of glitches and bugs. Why pay for something which can disappear at any time... whats worse is once it happens you have so much invested that you don\'t quit, KOA knows they can get away with it. If they made support better and fixed any errors, as well as making the items a bit cheaper, and event rewards better, this would be a great game. For now, KOA completely takes advantage of players and refuses to admit or fix their own system errors, avoid at all costs! Their response to this review will probably be to contact support like I already have many times. Just like the in game support, a standard response which is completely useless... update after contacting support again ""we checked and there were no errors in your game"" thanks KOA...', ""The game is really fun I've made friends over the past 2-1/2 years I've been playing. My only complaint is losing the friends I have made because the cost to keep playing and to gain any strength is so high that a lot have left the game. There are no new players haven't seen any for about a year now so our kingdom is slowly dying out. I hope the developers realize this before it's too late and the game becomes a dead game. You have buy something for almost every event it's really sad."", ""Very fun and easy to level up. It's great that you don't have to spend money to level up. It really depends on how active you are and also work on the quests to get rewards to level up. If you enjoy war games, this is the perfect game for you. If you just enjoy farming and chatting with people across the globe, this game is perfect for you. I hope this review helps you decide if this game is or isn't for you. Join an alliance that will help you grow and help you burn other kingdoms. Happy Games"", ""It was fun for a while, but then the bigger alliances come and farm you endlessly until you hate life. That's the problem with games like this. Until someone comes up with a game like this with some kind of limit on these play to win people that allows new players or any players to just have fun, I will never play a game like this again and I STRONGLY recommend you don't either. Save your time and money and enjoy stress free life. UPDATE: Talked to them about this, they closed matter already."", ""Fun game. Addictive. I have only been playing 3 weeks without spending money. You must join an alliance as it is a killing game and not in an alliance means you are open target. Downside of alliance is a bunch of losers spending a lot of money so they get mad if things don't go their way, use it to flirt and sexually explicit chat drama etc. I'm still playing but be prepared for childish drama. The game is fun I am progressing at a reasonable rate because I play daily to collect the resources."", ""Worst experience ever! The Advertising Is fake, Nothing like the game at all!

There are too many higher level people who have boughton from older players, using them for sabotaging new players and high levels, game is filled with Bullies & cheaters. Money is the Strategy here Avoid at all costs! Not worth the stress, let alone if you spend money on it. $30 a month for subscriptions HA!"", 'A lot of bugs going on in this game, simple things that require more testing. For example, when you upgrade a building the tap on that building stops working. Some missions require you to upgrade and do something on the same building, it turn out that I had to restart the game to make it work again. Really bad user experience in this game, you cannot see how many troops you are training. To check the building level you need to really zoom In.', ""The game is not that bad I just have a hard time understanding what to do in it. I like how they put a tutorial in the first part but I still didn't get it. Games like these I'm not really into so that's why I didn't understand what to do but if you know like games like these you would probably understand. For the chat it was just horrible. People kept saying such bad things and bad words and now that I know of that I'll delete it. It doesn't even x off the words. I can't even take off the chat"", 'WARNING!!!! PAY TO PLAY not just pay to win PAY TO PLAY in the game you have temporary ""builders"" when you end the tutorial you are forced to either 1. PAY to move forward 2. NEVER upgrade building after the tutorial (and THAT goes until level 5 BIG surprise) 3. Never play again In the first response from the developers I got ignored about this fact and they point only towards the fact that it\'s a FORCED TUTORIAL UNINSTALL!!!', 'Great game however some clarification on chapters would be most beneficial. For example when they start what miles stones need to be hit or a time frame when they go active a possible tutorial on them would be fantastic because as is just says not completed or finished with a date and certain important aspects of game are tied to this. Otherwise wonderful game great game play awesome graphics one of the best story lines for this genre. I happen to love it!', 'Played this game for 4 years. As the other reviews say, it is a play to pay game. Do not bother with this game, it will consume you, untill you are money less. If your kingdom is at war, you need to shield, this costs money! If you want to be competitive in KOA, you need to spend £200 - £500 per month, as KOA keeps bring new equipment out, new updates, mean more money.', 'This game has improved in a lot of ways. Of course cheaters make me wanna quit sometimes but thats with any game. My biggest issue is the prices for in game packages and how hard it is for non spenders to be able to get materials,gear, gems, and other items in order to grow and get stronger. Other then that KoA is an awesome and addicting game. Thank you KoA. Battle On!!!!!', ""I have been playing for a few weeks now, so I think it's the right time to share my thoughts. First off, the game is fun. It's good to grow and experience what it has to offer and can easily consume your free time. The problem is, if you don't have lots of disposable income, you're locked in a time gate. You do get a lot of freebies and such, but there are players spending hundreds of pounds daily to get ahead. The kingdom I was on, there were 2 players that clearly had too much income to know what to do with, so they started wars and slaughtering everyone big or small. I want to take a moment to mention this game is advertised as a multiplayer strategy. Although you do need to be strategic to play the game in a fair setting, there is nothing fair about this game. People who can afford to pay more money skip most of the time gates, such as upgrading your stronghold taking 4 days but them getting it immediately. There is nothing strategic about throwing money at a game and increasing your power to 2000% whilst everyone else is at 300-400% and steamrolling them. I have contacted support about the lack of balance, first time I got told it's a strategy game, they cannot stop people doing certain things, and the second time it was forwarded on to developers, which we all know as gamers means they have no answer to give and to just fob you off. It is clear this game is designed as a cash grab for those that are easily addicted. The episode of South Park with the canadian devil comes to mind. TL:DR Do not play this game if you want a game that relies purely on strategy for free. This game is Free to play, pay to succeed. I have been generous and given 3 stars, because I have enjoyed it up until the moment a single alliance went and steamrolled the entire kingdom killing literally everyone."", ""I would have given it a five-star but, everytime I try to save up any rss to upgrade, someone plunders it. I am set up for notifications but by the time I click on it and get the game open it's too late. You should implement something that allows users a few moments to get online to protect themselves before anyone can take resources.

There is 3 or 4 othere games in the game to help u get stuff to level up and buff up your armor and stuff. Just try it if u like Clash Of Kings. U will see. Even when your strong hold is at 18 there is still more new stuff 5o do. So quit reading and go play.', ""If you want to play for free it's a very grindy game. I've been at it for a month now and I've had to relocate a lot just to stay away from the bigger alliances. All in all its fun but after a week it gets really hard to play for free. Stock up on peace shields and teleports when you have the opportunity."", 'On the surface this is a bog-standard, dime-a-dozen building game, but it has a few interesting twists. It is full of IAPs, but they really are optional and only necessary for top players: free players can have their fun just like small spenders. The community is really necessary for playing, and reading guides to clarify more complex themes. Sometimes it is clear that the game was made in China, translations can be off. And there are a few annoying bugs or design choices, but nothing grave.', ""Dont play. First they take your money. After that they'll do it again. Support allowes backdoor for devs, mods and bigger Sharks to attack even when your castle is shielded. All funny b4 you slot in money. But you can game about a week without spending a dime.

Don't spend your money on this buggy mess of a game!"", ""After 9 months I've come to realize the hard reality this game will never be what it could be, rewarding players who spend thousands with invincibility and doing nothing about cheaters and rule breakers. Moderatators who see the behaviour do nothing and complaints are met with generic answers requesting proof that is impossible to give unless you record the game in real time. Fun for awhile but in the end it's and endless money grab with no return on investment."", ""KOA can be a thoroughly enjoyable experience. It can also be vacuum for your time & money. Be careful Pros: fun international teamwork; really cool graphics; immersive player experience. Cons: past events may leave you with items you can no longer use; the price for paid items can be extremely unreasonable; support doesn't really respond; some players disproportionately invest in the game to the point of politics, petty revenge & vindictive behavior. Be careful who you surround yourself with..."", ""This game was good until they started doing updates every other week. If you have a lot of money to blow on a game then this game is for you. In order to keep up with other players you have to spend money. Always something new, rarely ever update things that are outdated like portal. Everytime an item is updated the one that was released previously is hard to come by. It's just useless junk accumulating in the items bag. And I can keep going but there's a character limit here."", ""Takes a bit of work to get used to/into the game, but is worth the learning, best MMORPG on mobile.

Slows down once your fortress level gets towards 20, and attacks by OP players gets old quick. That said, if you find a decent alliance and don't mind the hurry-up-and-wait mentality this game reinforces, it's a good idle game.

I'm stronghold 20 and could not have done this without my amazing alliance members. We have one player in our kingdom who must have spent thousands on this game. Instead of moaning about it we as a collective kingdom have joined together to fight his credit card. My alliance sends all resources to each other in order to grow as a collective.Have grown 3 lvl 30s in a week just in house. If you play as team you can succeed! I like the chat best."", 'Bad game to many updates that overlap one another, not enough events, not good rewards for non pay player, as u cannot collect enough fragments to make a full piece be for they update and change what u get, and you will have about 74 /100 fragments and will become unavailable to you to finish. Also all events are out dated like portal fallen knights very boring events with very boring rewards again like 7 fragments and can only do three a week with updates every 2 weeks now we need 200frags lol', 'Be prepared to be taken for your money and not have it returned. They had an event with a fairly good reward. People spent money including myself, used up all their in game items to reach the reward and then they changed it to something meaningless and wont answer customer support emails asking for items to be returned. Also if you ever ask for a refund from google they will block your game from ever being able to buy any other items.', 'The only reason I downloaded this game was because of the ads that kept popping up, but this game is NOTHING like the ads. I thought it looked like something different, but it is exactly the same as every other game in this genre.

Besides that the game promotes one thing for purchase but will send you something different. Customer support is really no help. There is no way to get higher gear as you get to the higher levels without paying. I would honestly say save your time and money by not downloading the game.', ""Game was very enjoyable at first, but not anymore. Sure it's a free to play game, but it's pay to win. Too difficult and stressful when Alliance's like SAO constantly target the lower alliances and players. Takes forever to recover troops and resources after kill events. And shields don't mater because they will literally wait you out and then ponce. I hate games that allow this sort of thing. If I were you, I would avoid this game, unless you thrive on constant stress."", 'Amazing Game, I see with the new update you have added more needed supplies amounts etc, improovements. helps keep food on the table. nice work. who ever made this game was very smart and makes a killing finacially. so with that being said please stay fair with combo, and packages, all the work that goes into should be rewarded and loyallty dedication that actually goes into building a 30. very Addicitive.', ""Update: Please limit leeching attacks to 5 at most. All my troops have been destroyed, resources devoured and the attacks keep coming 15-30 times. I can't play because my troops are healing or being resurrected the whole time and with no resources nothing is happening. I can just as well stop playing because there's no playing for me or my alliance."", 'Worst game on the market. What is fun about waiting to grow when others speed with money? And when i come back to bubble before i get attacked your ads slow me down so i cant make it on time. Worst game ive ever played or been apart of. The people in my kindgom are alright people but thats not enough. This game is just unbalanced and boring. You dont even deserve 1 star.', ""Pay to win.

Proven insiders in the game that have access to unlimited resources and boosts to their account in order to stay ahead and keep people spending. - Reply to Century Game. I've spent roughly $30,000 in-game. So I'd hope by now I have a pretty good idea of how the game works. Your insiders ruin the game and I'm hoping one day I can get some sort of refund.""]"

Become a trader and sell your resources. Build your storage units and don't rush to upgrade your castle.

It's very difficult to expand your town and grow, without spending money. It's almost impossible to progress through this game at any pace, without spending money.

My answer is definitely no."", ""Fun and promising at the start and then once you get a bit bigger you get constantly raided by other players. No way to hide/protect your resources or your troops or strengthen your city enough to discourage the raids.

The reason I gave 4 stars is that I get all notifications except ones for when building/research is done. A little infuriating. Wish I could give extra half-star.', 'Got to L6 and the game froze on me due to a showstopper bug, GUI was active but nothing would build, no commands worked. No in game support.

The fundamental underpinning of this game requires the strong to prey on the weak. It's simply not possible to progress beyond a certain point otherwise.

Recommendations : 1) Don't play this game and waste your time and wallet 2) No fair play , cause if you are able to buy stuff from shop through chests (linari), then only you can have a fight or it is just a defeat by a opponent who can spend and get heros ."", 'Pay to win game with win more system. Even the cosmetic items give some sort of in game advantage. Game often crashes on low-mediocre devices, and eats battery like crazy. The energy saving mode doesnt do anything. Chinese players often end up joining forces and making life of English speaking players miserable. 2 months in, and realm population often drops below 100. Lategame gets exponentionaly more boring as time passes, and all additions to the game are to prevent old players from leaving.', 'Played this game for a long time and have given it the benefit of the doubt.

I bought a lot of upgrades but still its not enough... Imagine for a hero you need to spend 2,990 and for the dragon for 4,990... I think its not fair for other players who can't afford.."", '90% Chinese Servers Unless you speak Chinese you will find it very hard to get into this game, the concept of building houses and competing with other kingdoms is very good, but 9/10+ people speak Chinese so it is very hard to get involved in any kind of chats. There is a translate button where you can translate one line of text at a time but that is not feasible. Also clearly the servers are based in china or at least outside Europe as PVP battles seriously lag in UK.

I cannot praise it enough and that is coming from someone who is mainly a PC RPG / strategy gamer. The only downsides it has (i won't knock any stars off it for these) are as follows:- - What games refer to as 'noob bashing' is easy to exploit. - Formations for some races leave too many squares unfillable. - One of the best heroes can only be obtained via real money and only if you are lucky with him appearing in the shop."", ""I really like this game. I have been playing it from a long time and I never felt bored. The only thing I don't like is the selection method of the king.

Some people would think it came with the packet they purchased and not knowing that there was a problem with it.

It would be better if you increase the time of upgrades and the number of builders... And sometimes it becomes so slow and stucks... I feel that except these small things it's a great game! I hope you would try to fix these issues to make it better... And I would surely recommend this game to anyone."", ""Very possible to play free. Worth spending $15 also for first & last purchase. It slows around City Hall lvl 15, but the wait is worth it. You can hit 16 within a few weeks by playing after work. The game hooks you. Graphics, heroes, missions etc. is top of the rts charts for me. You don't want to play a game with fast times. If you're unlucky and start off near a bully, you have plenty of alliances to join without applying that you can teleport to, in order to train safely. It's a war game."", ""Very addictive. I usually hate these kinds of games but I have no idea why I got addicted to this game. The concept and gameplay is easy to understand and the game is very friendly and generous to new players. Although the Controls are sometimes very freaky. Like I didn't press anything but in the end the game just help me auto press something and such."", ""I want to be honest here, I downloaded this game as joke and now I have 200 consecutive day logged in games. This might be one of my favorite games on this app store. While yes, you do go faster in rankings if you pay you can play for free and it's fun engaging game that I spent countless hours on. Strongly recommend it. Unlike most games on this platform it doesn't have ads in any sense and I love it. Give it a try, it is addicting."", 'Alright, however there are two issues I have: 1. It\'s extremely similar to any other game like it. The only difference is literally the theme of it. It\'s better than the others but not special. 2. Your adds. Some adds have this annoying, over exaggerated voice and one specifically horrible add has a guy say ""conquerered."" He ruined one of the Roman empires best phrases by being illiterate and so ignorant of the phrase that he actually put a random er in the middle. Please change it. For my sake.', ""The game is actually fun, and I really enjoyed playing it. Highly addictive! The problem is all the super clans. I played the game for 30 days straight. In that time, my first clan disbanded without notice. The two other clans removed because a power level. I was 1.2 million power. The bullying and requirements clans expect is ridiculous. Why can't there be a kingdom for casual players and small Clans. Ones that don't care about kvk. Don't get me started on the lack of communication."", ""It is a fun war game but I think I'm about done. Unless you are prepared to spend thousands of dollars literally thousands of dollars you'll never be a very big player, no matter how may hours you spend grinding.

Plus you send gathers out only to find they get wiped out when you get back on, soooooo stupid!!!!!!!"", ""I've only played a few days. But i've really enjoyed the time i've spent building up my kingdom. The game continues to surprise me with it's progression, my only conplaint is how long some of the upgrades take, but that's the nature of these games. Besides that it has been enjoyable and has kept me entertained every time i've jumped on."", 'This game is great and addictive. I enjoy it a lot.But the reason i am not giving it 5 stars,is bcoz it is a complete pay to win game. Its not actual strategy that matters ,the number of troops , commander level matters,as it has a huge number of F2p players i think it should think should bring a change. But the best strategy game i have ever played', 'STAY AWAY! Great game! Pretty much an RTS casino, one of the best made. Has poker moments (Hold em or fold em) and Roulette moments. Sadly this game is poorly regulated and money talks. You will get bullied, even if you have a strong alliance. A P2W player can easily decimate an alliance in this game if they wanted to... depending how early they drop big doe. Players bullying in an open world makes politics annoying, kills your will to try and outspend Oligarchs and their children.', 'Best game ever! But it relies heavily on the chat system which is badly broken!!! Every update says it will make it better but it makes it worse! I have benn playing for over a year now and have spent a fee bucks on the game and I went from having no chat issues to downloading discord to chat with alliance members! Fix chat and you will get 5 stars.', ""Dont bother with this game the servers are filled with a bunch of people who have been playing for YEARS. You will get attacked non stop by level 20's and higher to get above iron age you need to spend money but that will be a waste because your level 15 castle does not stand a chance. In short a bunch of bullies are filled with the servers and they do not want new players in it. Terrible game no chance and I mean no chance of you getting about level 15 and if you do you are essentially a farm"", ""One star, shoulld be less. The game in itself is pretty good, but the option to buy things is a scum, you don't get the items and Customer support is not of any support. Play for free if you must but DO NOT spend any money on this game! UPDATE to the reply from support... No, you don't want to help. It is weeks now that all you have done is telling me: is the problem solved? Yes/No...... well no. You took my money and never gave me the items."", ""Fun.It's like Farmville+Civilization. Having more countries to choose from would be nice. I chose Japan, but so far the only japanese thing about my kingdom is the General and the architecture. I was given a General based on a historical person and a factual backstory. I really enjoyed that, but now i have 2 other generals not from japan and not based on real people. Suggestions: include more countries, more historical facts, and have the kingdom more themed around the player's selected country."", 'fun game that has lasted me a while.

They really didn't show real gameplay or really anything related to the game other than vague concepts so at first I felt a little bamboozled but was pleasantly surprised when it still turned out to be a solid game. Also for the Devs would recommend on rallies; once all the troops arrive to the max capacity of the castle the mobilizing time should end and the marching to the attack should begin immediately."", ""I have played other mmo war games. You must know when you sign up to play a game like this that there are pay-to-win aspects. The spenders keep the developers going and keep the servers running. However, Lilith has made such an effort to ensure all players have a role whether F2P or spender. I played King of Avalon, Lord's Mobile, Game of War, etc. All of them you must spend to compete and participate. Rise of Kingdoms is not that way at all. Anyone can play. Find a good alliance and have fun!"", ""I think it's really fun but they could add a first person view and mini games like they do in the ads but you can join clans with other people like the other battle games there are barbarians and other cities in the game that you can attack sometimes I could probably play it for a few months and then I could get dominated by other people it does get boring after a little bit / imagine if you could save princess and kill dragons / but I am wasting my battery doing this sooo bye!"", 'Well one of the best Kingdom MMO game here in Playstore. i did gave them a bad review before but now with many new events and awesome strategies and controls they have bring the game in a complete new level.

There's certainly the in-game purchases but that doesn't make the game P2W, in my view at least. Now let's go the negative part.I wanna give a higher rating but there's one major issue.

The problem is you can't create your own alliance and let it thrive. It needs to have p2w players including. Most people that join will quit the game after 3 or 4 days and then the map is just full of p2w alliances that will contest one another. The game is solely p2w . F2p will suffer. They will outpower you easily. Its a problem in every server. And that's why I've quit this game."", ""A lovely Game for both Free to play and Paid gamers. Well balanced. Here is a tip for gamers who are new and are free to play : time management and patience is the key. Always look for an alliance after TH lvl5. I'm a member of BBnF on server 705. Alliance will speed up you progress and help you achive a lot in the game."", ""This game has been surprisingly good so far. It is a lot more realistic than most other games of it's kind and I really like the soundtrack.

These guys have methods in place that keep game play pretty balanced with coiners, so you can succeed either way. They read your customer service reviews your not just talking to a bot. They are very generous with game items keep it fun."", 'Overall it is a very unique and first-of-its-kind game. But I feel there are too many restrictions when it comes to attacking other players, which is ultimately the most fun part for this kind of game. We have to worry about losing troops (which takes a long time to be trained), retaliation from the victim, the victim\'s alliance and sometimes even the King who tries to institute some kind of ""rule"" in ""his"" kingdom. This issue should be addressed in a way that it takes less effort to attack other players and those who are attacked only suffer a little and are encouraged to revenge.', ""The game is good and competitive but some of the research and training speeds are ridiculous. They need to reduce the times but at least 50%. Researching 30 days and over is ridiculous and building city hall upgrades 20+ level take 7days or more. Wow. Either reduce the times or slash the prices of gems and supplies by a substantial amount. Update I'm researching defense and its 60+days. How much do they want you to spen on speedups. Crazy. Also when there is a large war the graphics lag so bad"", ""Great concept, great execution. Be aware before you start playing this game, it's addicting at first because of the high rewards for almost everything that you do. You keep wanting to get bigger and then you get sucked in a Pay to Play loop. This is a tactic used by many mobile games but the developers of this game executed it perfectly. Players want to win KvK, but this game is based around how many microtransactions you can afford. Even P2W players struggle against other P2Ws."", 'Most good feature in this game is when higher lvl player attack lower lvl player while gathering resources on map and have same reward as attacking city. Is the troops bring resources everywhere they go? What the point of storage in town. What the point of gathering resources when you lost resources more than you gather. The person who have this idea should get a big raise. And possibly the dev wont read my review. So worth the star', ""This game is really amzing, out of my expectations, really. The buildings doesn't take long to upgrade, and you can also earn speed ups and gems really easily. The alliances are really good as well, you could help each other and reinforce each other just like a real civilization. You could also see the other players sending out armies and scouts, it's an amazing real time gaming experience."", 'Its honestly not as bad as I expected. Think clash of clans but on a much larger scale. Finding a big alliance is key, and they give you enough gems to get from level 1 to 8 in an hour. Sure, you could wait and save them, but gems and speed boosts become less important the further in the game you are. 4/5 too many ads.', ""Absolutely amazing game, it is much more than just a strategy game and I love it. The only reason I don't rate it 5 stars is because of the ad. The ads youve played are honestly the worst and most annoying things I have ever seen and possibly the worst part of the game. Please fire the speaker, please show the elements of the game in your ad and I promise you will find much more success."", 'Game was fun for a few days. But then, you realize that once again the Chinese players have unfair advabtages that make it p2w and no one else stands a chance. The premise is good... liked how the server slowly opens things. But still the Chinese managed to find ways to exploit. Game is now uninstalled.', ""The game is good, one of the better war strategy games I've played, the combat system is deep, elaborate and fun. Obtaining power takes a lot of time even for players who pay a lot, reaching the strongest tier units in the game will take you pretty much a year as a player who spends money (a lot), might be double for a free player. P2W is definitely a thing with two really powerful commanders being exclusively paid commanders but even those can be rivaled with free commanders. It's a good game."", 'Love the game. Has alot going on, kinda hard to get the hang of but fun once you do. Do your research cause this game can be a pain, but you can always fix it later on. Easy to reset skills n such. All in all, fun game, worth the hrs you put in it.', ""Lilith has become a very bad developer. The game mechanics and chat have been plaguing users for months. Chats don't update and there is no way to keep up with orders or social aspect. They don't realize how important the chats are and they haven't even addressed the issue. If you ask them they tell you to reinstall, change networks or add a VPN. They really have to be stupid to think an issue that affects everyone will be fixed by a VPN. The game lags and crashes a lot when server is overloaded"", 'This is P2W game. it is impossible for F2P to win this game. If you have no money just play to have fun. Dont expect to rise to the top. There is legendary hero that you can only get by paying real money. To be fair the game maker need money to bring out a good game. But seriously wish they could created a game that pay only to speed up progress or upgrade hero faster and not make it to pay to get exclusive hero. The game need both f2p and p2w player. It needs a bit of balance in this area']"

Then there's the serious lag (has been getting worse as time goes on) during events and glitches and bugs left and right that ruin an event even if you were looking forward to getting matched up against a maxed player that single handedly demolishes your entire alliance's top players. I know U know Devs."", ""Please don't let the dev's fool you this is a complete pay to win game. The updates are ridiculously and very expensive the last 2 research trees have costed over $8.000 and they put up new ones almost monthly.

I'm a spender and this is the most expensive game I have every played."", ""Its becoming more and more of a pay to win game, the matchups for events are unfair unless you spend $, monster drops have become very scarce, prizes for events have lowered, the 'mystery gifts' are small and do not help you.

Anyway, you can always turn on damage reduction in settings if you really don't want to think over the strategy that much.

2. The game balance is so bad!

[*] Please visit our forum for detailed changes.","[""This is my favorite turn-based strategy game wayback early 2000s. And I was amazed how this was ported to android and I LOVE IT! The old campaign is ported perfectly and I love the addition of new units, and the addition of abilities for every unit, making it more realistic than the original. Difficulty isn't an issue for me. More games please like this game :) Thank you so much!"", ""please, insert other weather, like summer map (ancient empire 1), sakura, or rainy maybe.. change damage reduction description to difficulty level to reduce complain, like 50% for easy, 100% for hard for example (so people will realize if he cant complete hard, he must play easy). and why i can't purchase unit after moving my unit to castle??? that's make me cant defend my castle,, enemy attacking castle and we cant defend? thats like playing idiot game"", 'Read the help before you start playing! There are more units and abilities than in the original games. Battle of Thorin is even tougher than in the original series but it is so rewarding when you finally beat it.', 'well this game is amazing, the only thing i hate about it, magic and physic attack. by all mean the game is really cool, but for campaign it is hard due to change of unit ability. best please change campaign units so i can finish, i barely did someone', 'Short review: This game sucks. Long review: This game really sucks because the AI can get an advantage at the early of game and buff on the attack and defense. Worse of all, the game is unfair. The commander on the AI side could revive over and over but it is over for you when the commander on your side die once. ONLY ONCE. The tactics could be used are very limited as you have no advantage in quantity and quality.', 'Nice port overall, however, theres a bug that ive encountered: -Cant seem to buy from a castle when a friendly non-commander unit is on it The movement squares and attack squares swapping their colours messed me up a little bit as well. Would suggest putting a changelog of different units and changes made from the original game till now.', ""The diffculty is too stiff in some missions. Once you realize your first two turns don't look promising, you're just heading to the inevitable defeat. I've played the original mobile version and don't remember it being this hard. You have to know the perfect start, else you lose."", 'I had a lot of fun with that game. With my friends. You can play it even with 3 friends.', 'Very good game for single and multiplayer, but, i think the UI can be more user friendly', ""Looks like Ancient Empires, plays nothing like it. Devs have no clue how to balance a game, which would be fine if they'd just remade the old games. Sadly they decided to add new units and change old ones, and every single thing they did made the game worse. Play the Statlex games instead, they're a faithful remake."", ""I can't scroll to the right for the unit production, is it my Android (Realme) or just some weird bug ?"", ""the recent update made it very hard to win, i always play friend in need, my alley sucks i prefer to play alone. i can't get what is he doing he always had his troops on buildings that i am trying to occupy, but the opponents works in perfect harmony. but that fkn alley sucks fk it also after update troops ability changed it made the druid fkn annoying and worthless I perfer how he was before."", 'i like it, i remenber when first time i play this game on java platform, and getting better on android so many improvement more mechanic i like it but some of these mechanic making OP char like, dragon on java version has weakness to archer but in this game it have dmg reduction instead, and the AI so damn good i must losing on purpose to know how AI act on certain map.. good job!!!', 'My Favorite TBS game eveeer!!!

Other than that, cool additions to the original, I appreciate your work', ""There's still some bug and make the game stuck or even close by itself"", 'Very bad game. the game is not balanced. the enemy troops and their coins outnumber me.

Best GAMEPLAY and also have additional mobs', ""Everything is ok but graphics are not suitable. Give more amazing graphics. And where's the battle animation?"", 'Great game for multiplayer and single player. It reminds me if my past.

Its sad if the game just die. :(', 'just a suggestion. make them level up the same as the original.. like you can level up to level 6? im not sure.', 'how can i make levels with star unit in level editor?(star which is seen top-right of a unit)', 'How can I buy units when I got other unit like archer camping at castle. Not getting buy option from castle at all. All I m getting is the information of the unit camped there.', 'The control is bad, we cant even attack before moving, so it makes the game extremely hard.', 'I played this game on Java mobiles.. a decade ago this is my all time favorite game.. game need some improvement for Androids', 'Please, can you give this game another update, to create the animation when fight? :( i really miss the animation.. anyway thank you so much for make this great game for free.. god bless you man..', ""Note: can't upload maps keeps saying connection error"", 'I played this game on Java and Symbians more than 10 years ago and still its my all time favorite game.

Needs a good many QoL improvements, but based on the current pace I'd give it five stars. Revised on 10/1: I will continue to update as things change. So far, two months in, only minor tweaks to an algorithm. Not a single feature implementation and performance is still garbage. Hopeful, but the dev communication is terrible and they dont know what they are doing it appears. I'm a Top 20 US player, and wont put another dollar in."", 'Fantastic game! Leagues ahead of its competitors, however... There are blatant cheaters with more than enough proof to confidently say that, THEY ARE CHEATING. However the devs are more worried about bad reviews from the cheaters, than to actually ban them and keep the legit die-hard fanbase alive. So, until these cheaters are banned, I cannot give this game more than 1 star. When they are banned, I will re-publish this review and give it the 5 stars it deserves.']"

The land is vast and rich with resources, leading a rush to explore and conquer. Countless towns have started a new life in these once barren lands.

A sudden mad experiment went terribly wrong, causing mass destruction, and a new world order. The evil Dr. Loveless was buried in the chaos, but not without leaving his mechanical castle and huge steam-powered Cyborg.

As a town Sheriff, you must lead an unsettled town to a new glory. Use legendary Heroes, wild west Gunners and Indian Warriors to defeat the Outlaws and mechanical creatures wandering in the wilderness. Merge with other Sheriffs to form alliances and fight for control of the mechanic castle! A mysterious technology with massive energy is hidden inside.

Become the Master of the wild west, and lead it into a new era!


- Return-

The once prosperous towns are now in ruins, and the people are lost. It is your responsibility to help them survive!

You can recruit legendary Heroes, train Gunners and Warriors, and use steam-engine technology to produce more advanced weapons. The town can provide you with all the resources you need to develop, with a steady flow of funds, materials, and weapons.

Right now, you are still not strong enough. While developing your Town, don't forget to defeat the wandering Outlaws and mechanic creatures nearby. This will not only bring safety to the Town, but also provide more materials for development.

-Revival-

Under your protection, the residents are safe and the town is gradually recovering. Your deeds have become well known, bringing in merchants, soldiers, and scientists every day. They hope to build a better town under your leadership by bringing more wealth and advanced technology.

However, you must beware of the hostile towns nearby who want to plunder your resources. Standing alone will make you exhausted and outnumbered. Join an Alliance, where all members work and grow together.

-War-

Expand! Conquer! Your alliance has hundreds of Towns, with tens of millions of warriors, and the Mechanic Castle firmly in your hands. The enemy Towns don’t stand a chance! The entire West will obey your command!

Here, we have players from all over the globe joining together in this new world!

Now, lead your Town to glory!

Spent thousands to try to compete then devs got greedy and updated the game by adding heros (another cash grab) stay away if ur a f2p. 1 massive spender can kill a server . Most servers die within a a couple of months. Save ur time and money and find something else.', ""Awesome better then KOA cheaper too. After playing the game for awhile I see alot of improvement that needs to be done. 1. Reinforcements will not travel with you if you port. This could be positive and negative but if one of you guys goes to attack an alliance it's only fair to be able to port with extra help. 2. The biggest problem i think is the cap on sending rss. If your not gunna offer building equipment to make it cheaper dont cap the amount of rss to send others in the alliance. Plz fx"", ""The game is great, until you get bullies by people who paid hundreds of dollars, and you realize that you can't do anything because, he put your troops in the hospital, or killed them all, and took all of your resources, so you can't do anything in the game anymore except get farmed."", ""Since the developers made it mandatory for us to update our games in order to continue playing, I haven't been able to get into the game or get the update to download even though I have plenty of memory on my phone. I'm locked out of the game at about the same point where I lost my previous game! Sadly, 1 star is the lowest rating I can give this game. I changed it from 5 stars to 1 star because I bought a new phone but my game wouldn't transfer. I lost everything I worked to build."", ""Improvements have been made. It's not as lagging as other games. And events are fun. Also does not over flood with pointless events like some other games I've played. Still could use some improvements with cost of packs. And what comes in the packs. But overall much improved. I give it a 4.5."", 'Item vanished from back pack. Was cool till i seen that. Little hard to screenshot the problem if its not there to screenshot unless i record a video while playing from beginning. Im aware stuff like this happens in new games but shouldnt have item rewards vanish from inventory out of the blue. I currently left and started new game on server 72 my user name is KINGFLUX. I lost them and honestly cant tell you what items they were or how many. But im gonna give it another go. From beginning again', 'After playing game four weeks its one of the few with any kind of game honor. I made it too lvl 23 with 28.4 million power. This wasent cheap but i thought worth it, however im now forced to leave the game forced out by the games policy to restrick this ellusive non exsistant Stamina!! Lot of money to lose over one thousand pounds i dont find it amusing at all nor will you by pass these pepole .', ""We are annoyed with this game! Warning! Soon will much the players would leave this game! Only the garbage when we got it!even we spend a lot of money in purchasing but game just give to nothing! Every kill anything we will lost the troops,hard to got it free gold,stamina,and rss.more purchasing more stingy! It's do not fair even got a good heroes so hardly even playing 24 hours in daily!😡"", ""Love the game but devs need to reconsider the chat restrictions! It is ridiculous to be banned from speaking over certain things. In kc I can understand, ac is another story. This is the only game I've ever played to have this sort of ban. Lift the crazy bans and I will reevaluate my review score. FYI there were no insults made. And the conversation being had was in good taste for the group of ppl discussing it. Your response is irrelevant. My rating stands."", 'Great game! Very fun and great for passing the time in an entertaining way.', ""Used to be a 5 star rating, now changed to 1 star. Most recent update massively cut daily and weekly rewards. Consumption events are criminally expensive now. Congrats, free to play players shouldn't even bother. Only for pay to play users now. You've ruined this game for anyone trying to compete at a high level.""]"

Game play can be glitchy sometimes, but Rumble has been working out the bugs.

Rumble is a greedy and sometimes shady developer that constantly downgrades rewards, introduces unfinished features and content, and ignores many players' concerns- it could be worse but there are still many glaring problems with the game. Play if you will, but I would NOT recommend you supporting Rumble with your money. They are already rolling in it and that's all they care about."", ""Aside from the bugs, uneven loading screens and constant outrageously priced pop up ads, this is a great game at the beginning. Then you hit an absolutely impenetrable pay wall. All of the other similar games I've played at least offer a grind it out option rather than paying absurd amounts of money. Not this time. Stamina, keys, crystals, etc. are consumed before you can even settle in. It's very disappointing considering how enjoyable this game would be if you could play it for more than 15 minutes every 8 hours."", ""Game is similar to summoner's war but unique in it's own way. Starting gifts are generous. I had some loading issues after I installed the app and played the first time but restarting the phone seemed to clear it up."", 'This game is outdated for 2019 there plenty games better looking', ""Great game. A lot of these recent, negative reviews are due to the most recent update to the game. What I have noticed in game, however, is that most of the negative feedback comes from bigger spenders. Rumble is doing a great job at keeping things interesting. I don't agree with everything they do but that's totally fine because the game is still really fun."", ""Overall, I'd consider it the best hero collection game I've ever played, the strategy/gameplay is deep, the heroes have a lot of variety and are interesting, and most importantly their auto-play feature is the BEST IN GENRE since you have to actually think about the team you auto-play with, but don't have to watch the same fights over and over.  It's downsides include a very basic AI, a UI that has fallen WAY behind the features it has implemented, and GROSS mismanagement by the devs. The size of the playerbase has dwindled as they've made changes that have made it impossible for non-paying players to keep up with the rest. While no one HAS TO pay to play the game, the paywalls in this game tower tall. They also increased the frequency of weekly events so that the game requires CONSTANT attention in order to play enough to complete events (They now run 3-4 week long events EVERY week, rather than 1 weeklong event every month). While adding all of these ways for top tier players to push harder (and spend more) they have done NOTHING to quicken the pace for newer players to level/play with the rest (meaning nobody new stays). It takes a solid year to reach top end play, not worth it."", ""This game was a nice one but now it's dead. The publisher wants to squeeze as much money as possible out of their players. With every update they just raise the possibility to level your heroes higher and higher to make the player spend more money. They sadly miss the point to add enjoyable content that is worth to investigate in. Played it since shortly after it's release and very disappointed to see it dying. Most long term player thinking about quitting right now."", ""I started playing this game in November of 2017, and I immediately fell in love with the gameplay experiance, and the idea of being part of an alliance, and working with others to set, and complete goals as a team. Another thing I really like is the gearing and building of heros, which make the heros completely unique in many ways. Makes for a much more enjoyable experiance. Even though I seem pleased with the game overall, I really don't care for some of the updates that have made serious change"", ""Another pay to win mediocre hero collection game... the biggest thing that turns me off other then games with rediculous microtransactions is when games force you to play through a tutorial.. I can't stand it. this game is no different than any other game of this genre. I've played it once a while back for a few months on a different account and I hated the tutorial back then as well. Dont waste your time unless your just really that bored."", 'I changed my review to reflect an update. They have a great game that is NOT play to win. Just make sure you register your account and can reinstall the game without losing your progress. Over a couple of months something causes the game to lag more and more until you reinstall and it runs 100% fast again.', 'cant play. stuck in a bug loop. i log in get a connection error. before i can press retry or logout it goes to fight the spire then get a connection error and logs me out automatically. then it starts all over again and again. ive uninstalled and cleared the fache and data and then reinstalled but it keeps doing this loop over and over. seemed like it would of been fun but i guess ill never no. pretty damn obnoxious too (edit) just tried again, still doing the same thing.', 'When started playing this game, it was very fun. You felt like you could compete with high vip players, sure they had an advantage but in time you could have 1 or 2 teams that could compete. But every new update made the game more and more p2w. Currently game is running on a skeleton staff, most of the devs have moved on to their new game. Nothing being done to attract new players, kinda sad, game had great potential, but they only see $ sign..', 'This game is excellent in so many ways. You can do well without payment. It has a sufficiently complex combat system without being overly complex. Other games have tried to replicate its formula but not nearly as well. My only complaint is that the story mode is WAY TOO SHORT! I enjoy the game enough that I would even pay for additional quests but none exist ...', 'This is my favorite app game I have ever played. yes, it gets redundant and grindy, but it is still a great game. The diversity in heroes, skills, and equipment allows for different teams and strategies without relying on pulling the one overpowered hero. sure their are some heroes that are just better than others, but it is a broad enough collection that you can easily get the great heroes. Also, early game progression has improved the chances of new players getting great heroes. Great community']"

More balanced, fair to all timezones, and doesn't screw it's player base like this game does."", ""The game doesn't want to be played. The first attempt failed because the game is stuck in the main screen, trying to connect. Second and subsequent attempts are trying to download additional files. I gave up on the game and had uninstalled it"", ""The game itself is enjoyable but the RNG is just too much. I spent thousands of ingots(the premium currency, obtainable via IAP or ingame grind) and never once got an S rank character. This wouldn't be so bad except if you don't have any of these characters you will lose in high end player vs player. The rates are just too low and you'll likely never see an S rank character unless you whale hardcore. Uninstalled after 2 years and over 200,000 ingots spent with no S ranks to show for it."", ""Dear Developers: There's something called a tutorial that is standard in nearly every game. It teaches players how to understand everything onscreen. The absence of a tutorial actually ruins the gameplay experience for many players because the game just doesn't make any sense. Such is what I experienced when playing this game. Cute graphics though. I'm just going to uninstall. Goodbye."", 'The game is a wonderful revival of the classic and set in ancient China. The player choices matter, and some hours of fun are in it, even, if the spoilers will drive some players off. I liked the general idea, story, and flair, but I really think too much pay to win & too many pop-up windows could beavoided.']"

Having the gems from PvP held being purchases is pretty bad too."", ""At first I gave this game a five star rating until I played it and realized I was stuck and that progression was going to be extremely slow unless I spent money. And this was only about four hours into playing the game. Thanks for wasting 4 hours of my life. I wanted to like your TBS game but it fell short due to horrible game mechanics. It's one thing to try and get people to spend money on the game, but when you hit a brick wall like that and you've hardly played that's kind of ridiculous."", ""The RPG aspect of this app is a nice touch.

Maybe a better tutorial or some type of map explaining the advantages between certain units', ""Throttled to the point of being unable to progress so fast it doesn't even begin to justify any time or money spent."", ""As a HOMM fan, I've been looking for a TBS game like the series and this one doesn't disappoint me. In fact, I've tried several other Android-TBS games but BH is better all around (graphics and variety of factions, creatures, skills, etc.). Sure, crystals are way expensive and creature prices go up exponentially, but just enjoy it and build up your army bit by bit daily. If you're the rushing type of guy but don't wanna spend a dime, then this probably isn't for you."", 'Sometime after playing awhile, I got this message asking for some direct feedback to the developers. I typed a few things and tried to send it but it says, ""Incorrect message"". If you don\'t want to read my feedback, why even ask for it then?', 'The game is very fun and enjoyable, but as a tactics game there is the issue of troops. Troops are plenty however to purchase new troops to replace the lost one requires much more money then you get through playing.', 'I really like this game but level up point upgradesystem woulr improove it or something.', 'This is an enjoyable game, and it certainly has potential. Slight resemblance to HoMM3 helps. That said, there are still balance issues, and winning streaks are punished for no clear reason.', 'Really disappointing, has promise but only really has one time fight story mode and duels. Needs some more action. Random fights or replay levels. Something to make it a little bit more of something, anything.', ""A little slow to get started but the balance is good and gameplay is fun.

After a while there is literally nothing interesting to do. You hit a wall and cannot progress much farther. More events erc needed to keep players coming back."", ""Braveland Heroes has a lot of potential, but falls short in so many ways. I do like the old school, turn based hexagon gameplay, however. The auto play feature is lacking as it's only available twice a day. There are a few replayable stages for material farming purposes, but they're limited. The cost of new units (randomized via chests) goes up exponentially the more you progress & buy. Many things cost in game diamonds, which is fine, but there aren't many opportunities to win/receive them."", 'Simple graphic and easy to play', ""The game is very nice if you want pay a lot and I mean a lot of money!!!

+ The number of league divisions has been increased from 9 to 13.
+ The user interface has been updated and improved!","['I really enjoyed playing the game, new players should know that this is an in-depth strategy game with vast winning conditions that players can utilize throughout the game. Very different from Clash Royale. And if you have seen the negative feedbacks bout cheaters and bot, I can assure you that those guys are just sore losers. Try to play it and see for yourself.', ""Should be the #1 competitive game for mobile! Very balanced and not paid to play as far as I can tell. Nice ranking system, made it to bronze before I had to use gems to replenish keys. I would highly recommend this to anyone. My new mobile game to play. Very simple mechanics, but only strategy has been the deciding factor. I like the win streak bonus, other wise would have got bored. It's like you took the vest of all strategy games and finally made a true competitive strategy. Very nice yes!!!"", ""This could be such a good game if the developers were more active in detecting cheaters. For example a player with 95 wins in a row and an average game time of 17 seconds is obviously cheating. But nothing is done pro-actively. The developers let it continue and rely on other players to report it. Monitor your own game, and fix the bugs that allow this. UPDATE: 52 minutes winning time on mist rock campaign (feb) proves app developers don't care about cheaters."", 'Great game easy to understand the mechanics on how to play love the game play feels a little smother to play than clash of clans like this game recommend it to my friends and family', ""Can't even login. Shows error connecting everytime the game is opened. Tried with different networks. Same problem."", ""Its fun for awhile, but then you run into p2w players. Their cards are so strong even with perfect counters you will lose. This leads to many frustrating games where you often can't win even if you play perfect. The game also has several cheeses which aren't really fun and don't lead to fun gameplay. Overall, I would rather play Clash Royale because the balance is much better."", 'After playing it for plenty of hours the concept deserves a perfect score but the execution is a 2. Clash of clans and clash royale are the proper examples of how phone games should be done. This game has issues showing the difference in characters and showing how different units health is affected by different units. Unless you pay intense attention you would be hard pressed to recognize the difference in damage that different characters do.', 'Very good game, thought out battles, reminds me of early c&c strategies. Great work!', 'While on the surface this may look like a clone of similar games. (and it is in many ways) This game manages to shine through a more Warcraft/Starcraft style of game play. With a whole host of Idle chess games about to hit mobile gaming, I think this one will stand out. GREAT animation and good story line keep it from being just another clone.', ""I had fun playing bots, winning, collecting rewards. At a certain point you stop playing bots and start playing humans. The humans playing this game are way better than you and have higher levels cards. I've been playing and losing to humans for only one day before I got so angry I had to uninstall the game. The card balance is whack, some cards and strategies just work, and no matter how much you refine and level a specific set of cards you get trashed by op cards and combos."", ""I love how the game looks like Warcraft. 😄 The graphics are really cool anime style. And it's so fun to play. I hope there will be more heroes in the future. 😊 My hero is Aella anyway. 😁 Good job devs! More power! ----------- EDIT: To those who said that this game is pay 2 win, for me it's not. I'm a free 2 play player and i got high level cards. Just don't be lazy doing daily quest and daily spin and you can upgrade your cards. 😜 I got Lv. 8 Aella and Merham the rest of my hero is Lv. 7. 😁"", ""Probably one of the best rts mobile games I've played. Unlike clash royale, this adds further complexity by having supply and pylons. The idea of simplicity on the resources are also quite fitting. Adding heroes makes the game very interesting as well."", ""Well rounded game, can feel like a bit of a power struggle when you start climbing the ranks. If you stay consistent with your login-in's and follow the meta you'll do just fine. This is not for casual players. It's a completely competitive RTS."", ""Really fun game. The strategy is enough to make it feel like an rts, while the game is simple enough to be quick and easy. Plus you get to regularly test your skill against people! I'm having a blast."", ""Improve rare chests drop rates. Make earning gems and golds easier, more obtainable. The game's a little laggy in matches but it's fun. Add more events with high rewards as well, only Mistrock gets boring"", 'Its a good game, but today they doing some maintenance and i dont mind abt that, but if i cant claim my daily login on the fifth day i play and has to start over, i will rate this as 1 star.', 'I love this game. Quite interesting for RTS fans like me. But the battery drained too fast even after set to maximum conserve battery. Need to improve on that. Others just perfect. Thumbs up dev team.', 'If u r looking for a fun game, this is not the one for u. Game becomes so boring after some time and it looks pretty dead. I asume that we play with bots most of the time. It is highly p2w once u r at higher rank. I am feel sry for investing a single minute of my life in this game.', 'I played this game for a few weeks now. I didnt have to pay to win. Already level 8. Alot of fun. After 3 weeks I bought some packs because these guys deserve the support. As far as a free phone rts game they nailed it.', 'Pretty cool game. Interesting take on mobile RTS. Really enjoyed it. Even though there is an upgrading element, it really does feel like there is a possibility to win even without high end troops. A nice change of pace from those high RNG RTS games.', ""Not just a pay 2 win game Yes paying gets you diff skins and levels you up faster, but skill matters more than levels in this game. Played a handful of games and by far this has been one of my favs.. It's been fun and fair. Keep up the good work guys."", 'Amazing artwork! Amazing gameplay! If you liked playing Warcraft or Starcraft back in the day, you are definitely going to ennoy this. Worth it.', ""It's a fantastic game, but since the last update it's a pain in the ass to launch. I have to start it 3-5 times to get past login :("", ""Super fun and addicting!! If u played games like c&c or Wc2 tides of darkness with assortments of heroes and units to utilize while expanding base (timing attacks) and collecting resources it's a go to try game :)"", 'Awesome depth! Awesome strategy! Unfortunatly its too quick paced. Usually, whoever upgrades fastest wins. Please make battles take longer, so the amazing strategy and depth youve designed can happen!', 'I love this game. It takes strategy and it could very easily come as far as other games in its genre with the right dev team and care behind it, you guys are doing awesome keep it up.', 'Great game 👍.. love how you need to do a bit more thinking about your strategy when facing off another player.. absolutely love it. Great Work.', 'The best RTS on Android. Attention to detail makes this fun to play, closest game I have found to blizzard-quality RTS...war craft, starcraft etc. Love that I dont need to pay to win.', 'First five days and I give a five star. If you have a good strategy you can make very far up the leader board. But wnd of the day if you wana hit the top you gona have to spend money. Just how it is', ""Great game. As a starcraft player this scratches that itch when I'm not at the PC. Very well made and addicting."", 'Just downloaded the game. Tried to open, it loads between 37 and 40 percent, stops and says an error occurred. Edit : got it to work finally. Game is fun.', ""Way better than any other RTS strategy game I'd ever played. Love the animations and sounds. Highly recommend at least trying..."", ""It sounds like starcraft which would be fun if I could I can actually play the game...the thing crashes literally everytime I go to my castle to upgrade stuff so I barely even know what the game is like....c'mon devs...what're you doin?"", 'Fun game, miniature Warcraft! My only complaint is the icon advertising 3v3. You can only play 3v3 at certain times of the day!', ""Terrible. 3v3 aren't available all the time. and the 3v3s are stupid. . . their nothing like 1v1's ! advertisement is a lie ! Terrible game !"", 'Suprisingly not pay to win and extremely solid gameplay.', 'The game has many things to improve on, but its addicting and awesome.', 'Super fun new styled fight system. Feels like old school Warcraft or Starcraft. Love it!!', 'Not sure why, but the game hangs on the loading screen at the start of the game on my Samsung Tab A 8.0 w s-pen 2019', 'This game BLOWS Clash Royal out of the water in terms of skill and keeping it fun.

But you need to advertise this game, seems like very few people play this game that's why matchmaking is taking very long after I reached 2k trophy. Keep updating and good luck 😊"", ""Keep lowering my score last time due to extremely unbalanced cheap cards like meteor golem and rolling charger, this time due to champion Mia completely breaking the game and making every other champion not viable anymore. Flight alone is a huge advantage over the other champs but give her the longest effective range due to the bouncing multi target chakram and it's gg. I love this game and would like to continue playing it but now I must design every deck trying to counter this champ."", ""I do like it and it's worth 4*.. I do feel like it needs a lot of work to me mostly options. More of a playing field maybe. Everything you get everyone else gets too so I don't like that part.

Don't worry, 3seconds is just the tutorial. Normal chests are 3Hours! It wouldn't be so bad if you could fill up all 4 slots and wait 3 hours to open all of them. But no, you can only wait 3 hours to open one at a time. Highly recommend to find another game to wait around and do nothing to progress."", 'I love the game and love the new balance changes but they need to nerf meteor golem and then all the cards will be balanced it does way too much tower damage please game devs im not the only person who wants it nerfed but still good game and this game is a freat card battle game like clash because you can use champions when you dont have mana and its really fun but still some matchmaking issues in my opinion i go against some high level players and other than that a really enjoyable game', ""It's 5 stars easy right now! You have made a great game and can tell you love the players. Good hard work and looking forward to what you do for the future. I love the Champion it's a game changer in a stuck genre.

Update 12/19- the devs are cool and listen to the players and the game is still awesome :)"", ""Nice twist on Clash Royale, but the tap to move controls are horribly slow. Also, some actual originality in the units design would have been nice. I understand that they want to keep things familiar for the veteran CR players and pull them into this game, but it'd be more fun if we weren't playing with the same cards."", ""If you enjoy crushing your opponent in a classy strategic fashion, this is your game.

The game design is great, game play can be sketchy and glitchy. Overall I think the customer service is where the majority of the help is needed. Graphics look great. This is a pay to win game, do not expect to kick any butt u less you do atleast a fair amount of purchasing. I will update this review as the game changes.', ""Pay to Play...plain and simple!! I've been playing for over 2 years & used to love the game. If your not willing to spend $200 USD a month don't bother, you will get destroyed. They constantly put out updates but only for items you have to pay to obtain. Plus the updates devalue anything you did pay for previously like better gear, gems, airship parts etc. They haven't ever upgraded resource tiles to allow us to gather needed resources for free. This is truly a pay to play game plain & simple!!"", 'i don\'t spend much , but i do like the small packages (.99) . i feel there are too many ""spend to win "" packs. otherwise the whole premises of the game is great. Unfortunately the game is getting over saturated with too much going on at once , no time to rebuild and recoup. with that being said me and my wife decided it was time to leave the game. though we met a lot of good people there . Tried this game again , and noticed they removed all the mid level aemor ! WHY ?', ""The game is good until you buy something and don't receive what you bought. Then you learn their customer service is horrendous; no answer from them or moderators. And then after so long the inquiry deletes itself and you have to put another one in and the cycle continues.

Updates seem focused on more ways to make us spend rather than keep it interesting. Everyone is getting tired of it and people are quitting."", 'What is up with the last update (version 5.1)? After the update now the in game translator is broken. Starting to get tired of the endless updates that are supposed to fix things, when all that happens is they add things and break others.

All small alliances and players do not get a fair and even chance of gaining rewards and trophies so they give up and it's down to the top 20 again who rule the game play.

Graphics poor and some of the tap tap tap to get round is not necessary makes the"", ""GoG is a fun game, a little pricey but it's fair enough compare to other games. The problem is this game obviously is very cheap for Korean people. They spend too much on their castles. My castle is in kingdom 257 and I averagely spend 20 CND dollars per month. No chance against them and they easily destroy you. The bottom line is if you can't spend more than 100 dollars per month on this game then don't waste your time and money for it.

Basically it's free to play because players that pay to play. ( those who make Purchases within game) Need easy cheap targets. Theres no level Equivalency no restrictions on what level of power a player needs to attack another (10,000,000 vs 10,000) the ten thousand never wins.

As the years passed gog makes it more about money then they do about the people who pay there paychecks. I am in a brand nee kingdom and i know how to play but with out paying there is no way to get good stats without spending over 3k to 10k$. Its only free to join the game and talk to people not to truly play! Don't download game unless you are willing to spend over 3k $ thats fir all country's."", ""Hi all, been playing for 2 years now and I have to say this game will cost you some serious coin if you want to win.

And if you spend money the sky is the limit!! I love this game!!!!!!', ""Similar to R.A.I.D. and I've played both. I stopped playin raid but this one seems to keep my attention. Like the heroes and it's not easy to get the best in the beginning but you do get some really cool heroes while working your way up to the best. Thanks dev's. Love it so far."", 'Seriously cool game. Plenty of rewards. A game whoch is actually concerned about the satisfaction of the players and not the makers pockets. The artwork is excellent. But just one suggestion. Introduce a function to manually fight the battles too. This will be a new step towards making the game one of the best. Great job devs👏👏👏', 'Game is literally TRASHED once you stopped spending money. I spent at least $120 or more and look at me now. It took me weeks just to gain enough points to proceed to next stage. This game is a HUGE RIPOFF. If they would only adopt a permanent VIP system, I would at least get benefits from that amd continue with the game. NO, THEY JUST WANT TO COME UP WITH THIS DAILY/WEEKLY/MONTHLY PACKAGE AND OTHER GOOD SHET TRYING TO LURE YOU IN. I AM SO TIRED OF THE GREEDY DEVS. SUPER LAME GAME!!!!', 'There is nothing you can not buy which means total pay to win. Within an hour of a new server big spenders will own the best equipment and heroes which will take months for moderate spenders to achieve and by that time the server is over. Not a problem if you are not matched against them but the war system is able to be manipulated so weak players ALWAYS have to face the very top players in every battle.', ""Excellent work! I've been playing (as pure F2P) your previous game Idle Heroes for years and this game feels very similar in the way I enjoyed but also very refreshing with stunning graphic. It's still quite P2W but that doesn't effect the game it self it just takes longer to obtain things. Overall I am very happy I just would recommend to reconsider in terms of graphics some characters feels having a little bit unnatural posture."", 'Love the game great graphics and good drop rates but xp is so less after you hit to lvl 45 its hard to earn xp and since you will be unlocked everything it takes you like a 10min to complete everything and wait for auto to lvl you up wich takes days .. i wish there were more things to do or allowing us to earn xp from other things too. Great game at the begining but after certain lvl it gets boring cus there is nothing else to do please add new options/dungeons i really love this game', ""I could forgive everything people are complaining about in the game except the lack of vision for long term play. This is not a game you'd want to spend on. Servers die down too soon leaving you with no choice but to quit. I've dropped big money and restarted 10 servers forward after the one where 1st account is died. New server dead too after just a month with 4 newer servers out. Will change this review if this improves if i hadn't uninstalled yet... *** Eh... i already quit. You're welcome."", ""I haven't had any bad experiences this far. But I'm only level 35 with 6 level 100 characters. S class. Which is nothing. I'm sure thing will get way more difficult as I go. I know from what I've seen in the arena I'm not gonna have many good experiences with that. I've got my ass handed to me Everytime I even think about pressing that arena button. But the character artwork is amazing in my eyes and so far game play is good. May change rating later, may not... Love it so far."", 'So far so good. I have only just begun playing and like most mobile hero collection games, pay to win exists. Lucky for me I am a PVE player. PVP is where this game can get a little rough, mainly because you can buy legendary pulls. Like I said, it may even out late game. Who knows. Fun for now though!', ""The game makes you lose to an inferior group of Fighters at random. Even when you are twice their strength. And if you do not watch the whole battle they will deem you as the loser. Even if you are three to four times stronger than the other team. You can sit at 300,000, and lose to somebody who's only 97,000. Completely unfair battles. Spending money does not make a difference you will still lose to an inferior group. Complaining does no good no one answers your email. Just another crappy game."", ""It is really simple, you run through dungeons with your team of hero's that rank from SS, S, A, B, C, D and fight enemies. This game has multiple servers and each server is full of players. Then there is an area where you can fight off other players and raise your ranks to get rewards at the end of each week. After that each hero can be equipped with runes, and equipment to make them alot stronger. However it takes so long to finally fight enemies your might that for the first 24 hours you ..."", ""The game is really fun, and I like that you can still level up offline. I'm glad the game gives players the chance to get s rank characters often, other games don't do that.

Thanks for the great game keep up the good work!!"", 'Grate game so far its very nice to new players, has a lot of things to do and gentaly intrtaining the only thing i feel its missing is a better way to understand your heros strength and what i should upgrade and so. (I could be missing somthing) other than that props to the game waiting to see what it will ofer on the future.', 'Looks good, but there is no gameplay to speak of, auto battle, auto equip, have to wait for ressources to generate to be able to improve your heroes when you are stuck, and there is nothing to do in between. Most pointless game i played so far, and i did try idle games. But well, to each is own, i guess.', 'AMAZING GAME This is like Empires and Puzzles without the Puzzles and more action and custimization. Also ALLOTT CHEAPER WOW!!! I dont see why anyone would complain this game is 80$ cheaper to play and you get so much more value and nobogy should be here complaining about prices. The games graphics and universe is amazing NO ADDS this is a top guality game 5 stars all the way... Finally a great game that wont rip you off...', 'Pay to play. Bad customer service. Refuses to reimburse for any game issues. Get same worthless characters over and over. Very little instructions. Shops keep same items. Guild war is a joke, places you against teams over 100 levels above you so your entire team dies in 1 hit. Game gets boring quickly. After 2 weeks you are level 70 and have to wait on auto grind to progress. Everything for the day can be done in under 10 minutes, then you have to wait 24 hours. Stay away from game.', 'the game looks good and all but for me its unplayable in some way. Every 2-3 minutes i get disconnected. Im playing with normal wifi connection. Im assuming its because of far away servers from my home. Im playing from Albania. Let me know when you guys solve this cause i wanna get back on playing the game, since i like it. For now im uninstalling. No hard feelings. Good job though, game looks really promising!!!', 'Edited review: after playing for a couple of weeks and even paying for VIP, I got tired of the RNG aspect of acquiring heroes by using ""scrolls."" Having to get lucky enough to get a card, then lucky enough to get multiples of that same card to upgrade it, is just terrible RNG odds. I spent $15 on the christmas pack and literally got duplicates of cards I already had. I would rather pay and know what I\'m getting than to pay and get nothing to advance my team of heroes. I uninstalled.', 'Free game progress ends at equipment level 5 after that you have to spend real money to buy evolution stones to upgrade hero equipment! Also leveling is very slow if you don\'t buy privilege card what gives you 300% exp. bonus! So ""free"" game progress ends right at item level 5!', 'Honestly like it more than idle heroes. Just wish that the auto battle x2 speed was faster or that there was a x3 speed. Another annoyance is guild wars always pairs me with the same person and if i make myself a little stronger to try and beat that person it changes them to an even stronger person that i now face over and over. Balance this and take away level caps for stages and would be a better game.', ""Oh it free to pay, but lots to pay for. I actually love that they have a lot to pay for, but too much & too $$$ much is too MUCH...lol That said it's a great game graphics are Great. Only real negatives are I wish we had more control over our characters (in battle) & need to make the x2 (speed of the battles) faster. Too slow if you ask me."", ""I rarely leave written reviews but I actually want to praise this game. Most games like this (AFK heros and others like it) often get you to a point where it can take days if not a week or more to make actual progress unless you open your wallet to do so. This game does have grindy points but they are easily able to be passed and don't require Microtransactions to do so. Overall this game is player friendly and well thought out. It can be Bulky feeling with the menus but nothing's perfect."", 'Just another idle team builder clone. Not the worst ive played but incredibly far from even a good one. Game isnt explained clearly enough, terrible ascension caps, super weak summons (especially considering this is the biggest draw to the game), and reasonably mediocre art. I would skip this one.', 'I was amazed that DH can make such a game. Great Graphics, great concept, diverse idle game mechanics. Its still a money grab, but not as much as idle heroes is. However the summoning rates are really terrible. I dont know what kind of luck is needed to pull a valid S hero and not the insignificant S ones. On top of that, you would need 3 copies of the same valid S hero inorder to promote. Luck based games dont last long and arent worth the effort or time. What a downside and disappointing...', 'I gave this game 2-stars previously. The main reason of dissatisfaction that I had was the insane monetization in the game. Like all mobile games, unfortunately, this game suffers from the greed disease, spreading in the gaming industry (sad). I gave it 2 more stars because I realize that the game has great support, good gameplay. Points I wished they worked on: The exchange system is great, but I see it pointless to change a HOLY SPIRIT pay the rare shrine totem and get her again. The way this game progresses is quick, and we get rewards in the beginning as some sort of a bait to play more and spend more money. I would hope there are better optimization regarding the economy. The Pros are many though: 1- No energy (That is gorgeous) 2- exchange system (needs fixing) 3- 10 hours auto farming for gold 4- Guaranteed S-rank after 10 Legendary summon This is just a review... I believe this game has a lot of potential and could take the spot and get us rid with the Greedy gotcha games Like the ""Youtube Biggest recent Sponsor (RSL)"" There are so many ideas that could make this game better!', ""Overall fun game with great artwork. I was pleasantly surprised with how the game kept drawing me in. As for paywalls I haven't seen any. The game seems friendly to those not wanting to spend, but provides plenty of options for those looking to build up quickly. Easily stands toe to toe with the other game's in this genre."", ""Great visuals, diverse amount of heroes, good amount of content, balanced, easy to learn, time saving, i could go on with the compliments. This game's only drawback is that it's a bit harsher without the privilege pack witch is quite expensive at 5$us for only 7 days 1.50$ or so would be better. But i wouldn't call it pay to win it just give the player more opportunities."", ""Amazing graphics and characters. It's very lovable game but if character action has 3d effects and some live critical damage shot that would've been more impressive. Over all it's a very nice game with very artistic approach. Just what I feel is that while playing it gives you a flat feeling. If it has a bit realistic impact then it would be cherry on cake."", ""Would get a 5 but for the poor store. This game is great except that the P2P packages are way too expensive for the very slight benefits that they give. Also, buying diamonds is pretty much worthless due to their limited usage. They have a store but there aren't many good items and those are limited to numbers that aren't often worth buying."", ""The fact that this game literally copied the Ad of Idle Heroes (An actual decent game) just shows that these developers don't care about creativity they just want your money. This app literally stole ALL the elements of the Idle Heroes ad. The only thing they changed was the look of the game. The name Idle Heroes was replaced with destiny summoner and the female voice was changed to compensate this Everything else is a straight copy Not even worth trying, just installed to make this review."", ""Game is allot of fun but guild war is broken. Why do I face the same overpowered guy every guild war. Every single fight that I've done has been against players who's team consists of 1 or 2 heroes who's combined power is higher then my team of 6 heroes. It's boring and unfair. Also, please let us skip campaign missions fully, not sure why we can skip everything in the game except the last level of a campaign stage."", 'Edited review* i think we can all agree that its definetely a very cool game but here are two major downsides. -game file is now massive way over 10 gigs for a mobile game? Wow prepare to piss money away on a large memory SD card at least 32 gigs-64 depending on your phone you have no choice in the matter sooner or later you will need one small and large updates will not stop eventually the game will likely at one point be over or around 20 gigs. -Guild war and arena Unbalanaced', ""The game has got some longevity to it. I've been playing longer than other similar games. Level 63 with 2 SS level characters for only $20 invested over the last month. You could easily drop a bomb on this game if you're not careful but you can have fun for about an hour a day without spending money"", 'Now that i play the game for sometime now! There are some problems : players progress is block heavily, summons limited and neft abyss reward....to encourage players to buy packages to move on! Those packages are plain pay to win mechanics that give those who bought them way more advantage over others! The game can not just have the skin only and rip off players like that so i will not keep this review positive anymore', ""I'm not much for idle games but I kinda like this one. Nice graphics and smooth gameplay. Not very clear when it comes to tips, how to play or how to do certain things though, you just learn things as you go. Pretty cool game though. Good potential."", 'Well for starters i love this game because of my friend. He suggested it to me so i gave it a try. And i love it. It really cool how you can attack online people and kinda gamble persay. So i rate it 5 star because why not!!', 'Its been good so far there are options to persay P2W but i feel like they give you enough resources that you get stronger naturally over playing the game. It doesnt feel like you are wasting your time to the point that you feel like your only option is to purchase anything avalible, not many games accomplish this so thats why I am giving it 5*', ""Good but broken. Barely earn gold through the story so you're forced to buy. GUILD WARS IS SO BROKEN. I can only battle between 1 person. Even after refreshing multiple times, it's the same person. I can forgive other things wrong but that I cannot. Fix it. Fix it. Fix it."", ""So I bought the pack for all rewards without watching ads. NOW i dont get my rewards for the 4x video. It's only giving me half of my idle gold every single time now. What's the deal with that? I was loving the game until I bought that pack. I'd rather watch ads now to get my full value of the 4x offline gold""]"

Easy to understand mechanics make it slightly addictive but like most games it becomes a cash grab after a certain point. Every battle costs food so youll never get more than an hour b4 you run out and have to quit or buy more. No pvp at all. Obtaining any hero more than 1 star is impossible. if you download this plan to uninstall after a day or two. Fun while on the toilet.', 'This game has been a game I been looking seems very fun, Their are huge amount of variety heroes to gain seems very strategic :) I will enjoy this game!!! 👍👍👍👍👍', 'Just plain boring after the grinding begins at around level 25. Guild events are no fun. Ugly childish looking characters.', 'I cant even open the app. And no its not just my device because I downloaded it on a different one as well.', 'Overall 4 stars: played the game for several months. leveling can be hard but you can use help from your guild. Pvp is not that hard. However as always at some point for a f2p player you can only be the best of the rest unless you pay. Its easy to get diamonds if you do you daily quests, however new heroes are not in the chests. You need to do the events to slowly get pieces to summon the new hero. If they would decrease the amount you need f2p get a better chance.I enjoyed playing this game.', 'Generic has all the other mobile ""rpg"" out there. Win tons of trash the devs pridly call loot, stupid amounts of currencies to keep the shity grind going. The main menu is BAD, with so many stuff pilled on on top uncomprensible building names. Worse, the oracle roulette is a scam its not random at all. The best part of the game is army positioning, it gives the game an extra originality and strategy quality, but that alone aint gonna keep me hooked up.', 'Fun and strategic game!!', 'Fun addicting... Buuuuttttt, $$$ if you wantvto compete', 'Unfortunately during the updating after I download it it asks for my account to link with game. It just loads and loads and does not do anything', 'Good easy to learn game', 'I like this game but more improvement', ""This game is built on people spending lots of money. Hardly anyone chats. There are no in game tutorials. The developers depend on forums for you to learn the game. There is no strategy other than out spend your opponents. You can't compete with those willing to spend $100 just to get a character and another $100 to upgrade that character. If your not willing to spend $1000 on this game look else where. I should have quit a long time ago."", 'Relatively early in the game but fun so far. Minimal invasive ads. I assume like most similar games, once you get to a certain point it becomes grindy unless you pay.', 'The game is not open the Android version 7....', 'an awesome game overall. new content added often, you dont have to pay to win (from experience, you dont have to spend money to get anything; everything can be unlocked through gameplay but, this is one of the few games that i made in-game purchases; in support of a good games). a good number of heroes to choose from (unit selection and placement can determine the outcome of each battle).', ""Good strategy and various unit compositions. Popular teams are sometimes nerfed as new units come out so that you are pressured to spend money to buy gems and stay relevant end game, but some of the best units are indeed accessible without following this model. Make no mistake, there are players who spend insane amounts, and progress can slow to a crawl if you don't drop at least the free gems for life pack, but despite the greed units and combat itself is very fun. Energy generation, physical / magic dmg comps, and ranges units guarded by powerful tanks are all examples of common strategies. Give it a chance, just don't let the game rob you."", ""Fun game, most important you don't have to spend a lot to win. Update 3-20-2019: A lot of people complain about lack of support from game developers. I ran into a problem that stopped this game from loading. I really live this game. I emailed developers and they kept working with me for a week until I got it running smoothly again. That's great tech support! That's another reason to try this game."", ""This is like a barer, freemium version of Ravenmark: Mercenaries. After formation allocation, the battle goes on auto, aside from triggering skills, so there's little micro-managing. And as a freemium, it's much more grindy. You're given lots of stuff in the beginning so you're able to try out the game but like many other games, the design and goal is monetization."", ""At first I wasn't sure if this game would fit what I am looking for. And I assure it's worth trying. The game was good. I'm addicted to this game But I hope they have this thing that if you lose your game they have a retrieving account. But still a good game. Improved it with an account associated. Two thumbs up. 😊"", 'Fun at first. You place troops in formations, which determine who their initial target is. Lots of varied heroes to pick from too. Pacing and progression seems great at first, but hit a wall around level 29. There is not much you can do to progress at that point so you will just be grinding for levels.', ""Steer clear of this game if you're playing through BlueStacks 3. It used to work just fine, but until the recent update, it is now broken and unplayable. It tries to load, but after a minute does nothing but drop back to the main screen. Wasn't a bad game, just unplayable now. Time to uninstall."", 'Squad based tactical battles with position, timing, and unit development. Worth a try for casual play . Scales for more difficult challenges. Has a lifetime single charge sub which is unusual for these types of games.', 'Another energy based game that showers you with small amounts of rewards in the start but will quickly push you to spend money if you want to do anything. You will be deeply frustrated the more you play. EDIT: forgot to add they also have loot boxes. Drags it down another star.', 'This game is really heckin good. I have to say, I\'m experiencing a graphics error where weird shapes are covering the enemies line. if this is supposed to be a ""fog of war"" it\'s not very obvious. once fixed, i will change to five stars', 'they have ruined the defence towers in this game. All the time people spent to get the higher in rank pointless and a waste of time. they also have 4 events on at the same time, how are the weaker or non spender alliance meant to improve. I suggest you cover all those tower blueprints to astro prints quickly', 'Game theme is good but a snail is more faster than your loading and it lags so extreme which made the game to play near to impossible so I uninstalled, hope there may be a work needed to ne initiated from your side so that many of players like me can play with ease, Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 inches with 1 GB RAM.', ""Alot of fun! Very addictive! Grind it out or pay to win. The grind can be a little slow but not too painful. So far great community. Haven't had to contact support so I can't say how that aspect of the game is. Overall a great game and a great time killer!"", ""So far loving it...seems fairer than most other games. My only gripe is once you've set your troop into action, you can change anything mid battle."", ""Engaging game that requires decent amount of strategy, but not overly complex. And the leveling up should help with those who dont want to strategize too much... or can't haha"", 'One of the few games where it is truly not necessary to spend money. Props to the devs. Now go kill something!!!', ""Love this game!! Can spend heaps of time on here without having to spend money. Genuinely might start spending simply because I didn't have to before because its so well balanced. Well done Kongregate"", 'played for quite a few hours so far 😁 and its great. Took a few great concepts from other games and made it into one very nicely made game in my opinion. highly recommended for something different but familiar 😊', 'Awesome game... Cool graphics & Heroes. But now the owners are getting greedy.. launching overpowered heroes to cash some real money. Also, i am annoyed of constant game crashes.', 'Give the screen rotation option so that we can view our hero in every direction...and zoomed effect.plz add mini stages to clear and boss battle at the end of journey/battle thanks.', 'A pretty darn good game. a good variety of things to do, and you play for quite a long time before you hit that wall where everything slows down. Much longer than most other games.', ""I'm sure I'll hit a paywall @ some point but its kept me pretty interested for a couple weeks and imo that's about all you can ask for from a free game."", ""Third time played game.... It always crashes once I'm level 40... Probably because I don't spend cash... Don't bother to play if you think it's for free."", ""This isn't a clone of any other game. This game is quite average but well made as well. This game is absolutely worth to try."", 'Fantastic game! forces you to think strategically. well balanced team and not so much P2W. Definitely a rare gem in the playstore.', 'its rather a very slow pace game developers should do something about .It gets boring after sometime.On the one hand they are releasing new heroes but players cant even get the old ones in gold chest.']"

Sources of gems you can earn are being removed, summons are much more expensive with terrible drop rates, and increased counter. This is not conducive to a positive player experience and is a very cynical attitude to take with an already dwindling player base because the end game progression rate is already way to long. Now their solution is to make it even longer hoping people will feel they have no other choice but to pay.', 'I keep seeing people saying that the game\'s graphics are old and out-dated, but ACKCHYUALLY, what they mean is the ""Art Style"", which is really subjective mind you! The game\'s graphics are perfectly fine, in fact it might be on the better side, especially if you\'re playing on mobile and not on an emulator. The skill animations and character SFXs are no problem and feel easily tied to the gameplay. If the art style isn\'t your cup of tea, fine, but don\'t go around blaming it on the ""graphics""!', ""Having no trouble with early game, but then again usually games are all the same at this stage. The system does seem generous enough to be giving a hefty amount of gems, but I'm not sure what are essentials in this game at the moment, so I'm gonna hold on to them for now, just until I know the game well enough."", ""Freeze/disconnect constantly I finally found a great game with everything I have been looking for...then it starts to freeze. At first it wasn't that bad but now it's every 5 minutes to the point it's completely unplayable. Fix that and it's a good game, until then I'll keep looking. LG Stylo 4 Android 9 game version 1.7.3.88.3377"", ""Giving a 1 star as once you need to do group battles, it's a nightmare to get a group. Guild boss battles has no reward if a leader opens in the middle of the night and kills everyone. I could unlock 2 characters in collection if I could just get a 5 and 10 man co-op to work. Need to remove and just bot fill as they are smarter. Start hitting a paywall fast in the vs games also. With little variety of high end characters you know when you are beat as soon as you see them."", 'It\'s okay. A lot of the bosses have some balance issues, they\'re either too easy or too hard.. The skills need better tool tips, and the ""shards"" mechanic should be limited to S and SS heroes only. Too many ridiculous game types that just arent fun .. Could really use some simplification and streamlining -- quality over quantity.', ""On the last update the summon procedure and drop rates were changed dramatically. It is not possible to get an S drop at all and it takes 100 attempts, 20k gems, for a random SS. Before the update you could get multiple Ss and SSs in a single 10 roll. Cs shouldn't even drop from the premium summons. Surprise me and make a positive change to this in the next update."", ""The game is quite free in terms of team comp and skill combinations. I know everyone's gonna be after the SS heroes, but the truth is the other heroes work just as well sometimes. If they start sucking at stages as early as now, then trust me an SS won't do any better! The issue is how much you've trained the character!"", 'Game is crashing now allmost every arena battle or co cp. Or freezing causing me to restart. Love this game. Became my 2nd fav tied with my fav. Getting really bummed out that its doing this now. I preregistered for it was planing on dumping good money into it. Now im sceptical. Hope they fix this lg stylo 4 all up to date. 3 star til fix then a total 5 star. Love this game.', 'The devs have taken the only eco for free players away for a ""rework"" all the while you can barely sustain a stable connection to the game. Have not addressed the ongoing issues with servers, but hey lets ""rework"" the only eco for f2p. Zero compensation for those that grinded in tourny before it was taken away or emergency maintenance for server upkeep that helped nothing. But we get a new FB likes that\'ll we\'ll never achieve because you\'re killing your game. So sad, had high hopes! NA Server', ""It's true that this game is viable for both P2W and F2P, but you must have the correct mindset going into either. For P2W players, it's pretty straight-forward, but still, you should be calculating the best purchases that offer the most per value. In my experience, that would be the long term offers, such as Subscription Cards or Growth Packs. They dilute a huge amount of resources into a long span of days, so what you should be doing is saving gems, using them only on things you really need, such as stamina or the once in a while Echelon Stones. For F2P players, that is even more so the case! Saving gems is a must, using them only when you actually need it. Rushing progress has no real merits, as you'll just hit the bottleneck later on. So you might as well get used to progressing a little each day. That way when the Limited-Time Summon Events come out, you'll be guaranteed to get the hero."", 'So far 5 stars and friendly for free to play! I like the mixture between auto battle and manual. Certain fights require skill to beat and knowing your heroes/abilities which stops it from getting boring. The events are rewarding and diamonds seem relatively easy to come by. Biggest flaw for me is guild bosses because they die too fast before everyone getting a chance to hit. I would suggest limiting respawns and increasing hp. Search The Giraffe Corner on youtube where I upload guides.', 'Hope devs reads this. Ok stumbled onto this quirky yet awsome looking in a 3d cartoonish world. Smooth fram rate even for my older model phone ( ZTE MAX) love the fact its still compatiable. Gameplay is every other catcha game, story does not have over abundent cut scene which i like. Better then summoner war on getting mons you like. They have a practice mode when you get further into the game. Wish you could change squad in that so you dont have to go back to main menu. Overall f2p for now', 'Game seems great except for frequent freezing, almost anytime that I get into a fight, or summoning heroes, or just whenever. Using a Moto e5, android version 8.1.0, Game version 1.7.3 which is the latest that I can download Google Play. And yes, I tried re-installing but still freezing randomly in and out of fights.', ""I've been playing for months - haven't spent a nickel. I play a little bit every day as I unwind. Very simple game to play. You can rack up enough gems to progress nicely and upgrade frequently. I've read some of the negative comments and they make me wonder what game they are playing. The infrequent, but timely upgrades haven't been a problem for me at all. One of the best free games I've ever played."", ""Too dependent on cooperation where too few are available. The events are also super lame, if I wanted a bas flappy bird clone I'd play an actual flappy bird clone. Drop rates are pretty bad and chest contains ridiculous loot, nothing like getting 200 gold when something costs 200000. And as I said before bosses get so much stronger that it builds a paywall unless you wait weeks at a time to gain strength."", 'I look forward to playing the game. Right now, I can\'t get past the login due to ""unstable internet connection."" I have 100mb/s cable internet and I\'m sitting right next to the router. I have no problem from any other device in my house. I switched to cell service, same error.', 'A good game even though pay to win, but three stars because online matchmaking functions do not work. I always get ""Battle connection failed"" when my wifi and data both work. I assume it has to do with your bad servers. Fix this issue and my rating will be higher. UPDATE: Gems are easy to lose. Paid content should always have a ""confirm spend curency"" function. I accidentally spent most of my gems on something via miss tap, and lost it all cause there was no confirm popup. Fix this! I wasted $!', ""I really love the concept for this game, as a gacha rpg that was based on old-school mmo raids, and enjoy playing quite a bit. However, good f***ing christ does it crash a lot. After the most recent update, I can't even so much as get past the login screen. Tried reinstalling, did not help. It might just be that I'm on a Samsung Tab S2 and just dont meet the system reqs, but I've never had issues with any other game and I hope there's something to be done about its stability."", 'Great game, horrible experience. No complain about the game itself just the fact it freezes every 5-10mins like a few other are saying. Before i get the try this response...google apps are updated, cleared cache, repaired client even uninstalled and reinstalled, internet connection isnt an issue, its a problem with the game. It happens in between screens or when it has to load information it just locks up or black screens, started happening after the first update', 'I get the feeling that a lot of people don\'t see how good this game is because they don\'t understand ""how"" to play these types of games. It\'s important to have a correct mindset, which is not to squander gems on just pulling out cards! Use some daily only on necessities for progress, like stamina or coins, maybe even some echelon stones. Apart from these, SAVE THOSE GEMS!!! For what you might ask? For events such as the Limited Summoning, or for when that one golden gear appears! You can tell if a game is P2W if there are no other ways of obtaining SS heroes, or the most valuable resources in game. The Hero token exchange, soul shards, free SS hero rewards, and Collection systems all suggest otherwise! Stop trying to rush progress and get used to aggregating resources and progress little by little, day by day. If you can\'t stand it, then this game isn\'t for you, but that doesn\'t mean the game is bad in its own genre!', ""Poor multiplay execution. When you try to complete your co-op missions, after spending 10-40 minutes to form a group, you or someone in your group will freeze or crash, ending the raid right there and then. The subject gets ignored by the devs, when it's brought up, you get a BS answer and the devs hope you forget about it. IT'S AN ISSUE! It's not my phone or my Android version or app version, EVERYONE IS EXPERIENCING IT! Been playing since NA launch and I've put good money into it but I'm done."", ""What is with the time limit on the Story/campaign mode ? I couldn't get pass a certain map because even though my team didn't die but the time went to 0 and we lost the battle. I am not happy with the gamestyle in addition to the stamina system. This is a P2W for all I know."", ""I love this game, would even recommend it to just about anyone looking for a genuinely fun experience. Though the biggest drawback for me is the constant disconnecting, half the time I cant even login. Very annoying when you're in the middle of a guild raid and it suddenly freezes up and boots you out. Dont experience this issue with any of my other multiplayer games.

No other apps i use do this and i see plenty of other people are having the same issue. Shame really because i could have seen getting into this but had to uninstall.', 'Still early game, but thus far, I LOVE the battle system. Battles require legit tactics. Boss fights take me back to WoW when I would be tanking, kiting, setting cc targets. And no complaints about the challenge of the game. The tutorial caught me by surprise when my tank was quickly melted away because I was late on aoe cc. Hope the game will show more challenges as it progresses. I normally would not provide a 5 star while I am just getting use to it. This game is well designed.', 'There is no such thing as a ""true F2P gacha RPG"", the closest thing you\'re ever going get is one that rewards you enough for the time you put into the game through resources and in-game currency. This game is basically a typical example, so I\'m cool with it.', ""The game itself was fun, even though it would freeze every 15 minutes or so. Every purchase I made I never got my items and I have emailed the company and I was refused my money back. They also turn your secure VPN off during your game experience which is also shady. They don't have a right to turn my VPN off on my phone."", ""I am absolutely enjoying this game so far. The regular fights are fun, but it's the boss fights where this game truly shines. Boss fights have raid mechanics reminiscent of WoW. This not only adds a new dimension of stratagy as well as fun to the game."", ""I can download and get to the first white screen. It will not load anything past that point. If this game is not compatible with certain devices, please make that information available. I deleted like 10 apps just to download it, just to figure out I'm playing a black screen"", 'CM Raider is working hard lol. Great game with a wide variety of activities and heroes. Including 2, 5, and 10 player modes with weekly rewards. The quick daily mini games are amusing and easy to find a buddy for. Friendslist caps at 100 which is also a nice touch. Loving the visuals and events as well. My only complaint is that they need to work on a desync issue in co-op modes.', 'Great tutorial. Fun game. Earn autoplay and get good toons. Then you get to a level that you cant auto through. Try and figure out what button to push when auto doesnt work. And now you hit the play wall. Game freezes up after about 20 minutes.', ""I installed this game based off of low reviews but I am impressed with this game. It is very cute and you don't have to pay alot of money to get good heros and a team worth fighting with! I'm loving this game and will continue to battle on! 👍👍"", ""I enjoy this game so thoroughly, just count each star as 2. It's not just a lazy cash grab like most RPGs on the play store. I haven't even gotten past the first zone and already I can see myself playing forever. Even though it doesn't have a perfect overall score, the devs should just pretend it does because it deserves it. Bravo!"", 'I would probably rate this higher if it didnt say disconnected please hold for 30s after EVERY single campaign stage. Im on a 5g home wifi network not cell service, so the problem isnt me, its your servers. It equals out to like 45 seconds to a minute after every match.', 'Too many pop ups for services and sales. Game keeps freezing when I back out to another section of the game. It does have cool looking characters and good graphics. I like the spacial move cut scenes. This game still needs polishing to me.', 'this is so far the best mobile game ive ever played, usually theyre boring as hell and the gameplay is just tedious, this one actually requires strategy and focus a refreshing change of pace from the run of the mill. i give it a 10/10', 'Really nice gameplay mechanics and I love it. The only main thing is that it crashes when I play the game more than 15-20 mins and it crashes. Please fix this and it would be great to play again. Phone is a Xiaomi Redmi 5 Plus.', ""So far so good.....Moving around during boss fights is new and cool but its still to early to give a more accurate and definitive comment for others to go by. 5 starts for now but we'll see if it remains 5 starts after a week of play.

Fate of Phoenix,phoenix.strategy,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=phoenix.strategy&hl=en&gl=us,"The kingdom has fallen! The empire of Azenor, once strong and prosperous, was attacked by the Dark Lord and his hordes of horrible, savage orks. The realm repelled the threat, but at what cost? Cities that were once rich and beautiful are in ruins; lords who used to be like brothers are locked in strife; the peaceful races of humans, elves, and dwarves are oppressed by hunger and devastation. And worst of all are the rumors that the Dark Lord is back! One hope remains for the abandoned kingdom: a hero who will unite all races, destroy the orks, and become the new king! Will you be this hero? 

Start in this classic strategy RPG as the lord of your own castle, upgrade it, expand your influence to the countryside, and conquer your own kingdom! Thousands of threats stand in your way: you are surrounded by dens of monsters and the undead, and the mighty lords of other castles long to destroy you and rule your lands. Act wisely, be strategic, train your army, and summon mighty beasts to become the strongest king and the new Emperor of Azenor! 

Fate of Phoenix is a strategy RPG with the following features: 

● Build up your city from a small fort to the capital! Build plants, collect resources, invite inhabitants, and upgrade buildings to make your stronghold rich and unassailable—the best features of classic city builder strategy games.
● Win the global war! Challenge real players all around the world in a battle for the empire. Improve your strategy, siege nearby cities, spy on and control villages to prove your superior power. Become the greatest leader in Azenor.
● Mobilize your army and train your troops. Recruit an army of 24 units of different levels. Train and upgrade your infantry, cavalry, ranged attackers, spies, siege machines, and beasts. Unleash your fury against the monsters!
● Summon mighty beasts to join your army. When your kingdom is under attack by horrible monsters, humans are useless against such a threat. Bolster your squads with glorious and strong beast reinforcements that can replace 10,000 solders: terrifying trolls, fire dragons, dangerous yetis, or noble gryphons.
● Follow a campaign with detailed lore to save your kingdom. The empire is on the edge of destruction due to the strife and hunger. But now horrible orks are returning to the realm in search of mayhem and revenge. Be the one to save Azenor! 
● Join the Alliance! Find allies all around the world and destroy the strongest enemies together.

That is until you get a couple of hours in then they force you to wait 24 hours to advance 3 levels. After that you are stuck with a boring sub par pvp match that has very little depth (in my early game experience). The microtransactions don't seem to be overly greedy but limiting play is not going to make me want to play more. Instead I will just uninstall."", 'Fun for a second & then ranking up Heroes still doesnt get you anywhere. Another slow grind game, get stuck on certain levels & be there for a week. Get 3 stars on a level, 5 levels after the 1 star level you cant beat. Have no money & try to buy thing, ranks heroes, upgrade equipment, etc, etc, etc. Fun for about a week, then a chore & EXTREMElY frustrating!!!!!!!!', ""Where have you been all my life? Been looking for a game where you can level up fast without spending a lot of money to get stronger characters! Plus there's no advertisements at all! Been thinking in the future to upgrade to avail the VIP. Kudos to the makers! PS: I usually don't leave reviews for a game but this is exceptional!"", ""Love this Game! Play for free still level up as much as anyone in VIP....Ovbiously at a slower rate but, you don't get bombarded with adverts like other free play games. If you do spend money in game it's not extortionatly priced for currency. Best game ever, I'm addicted and on almost everyday with so many different leveling techniques, in game guilds, team battles, armour upgrades, tier building, everything you could want."", 'It has good graphics, gameplay, etc. Although the events are pretty hard for some new players ( like me ) i was thinking for putting an event on a special day like puting an easy event for heroes ( 5-stars ) and add it on ads so some people who sees it will be more interested since its limited to do ( 5-stars heroes LnD or some attributes they want ) and also i was thinking of putting an event that you can customize a new hero that you want (atk,spd,def,etc will be low though)(need to upgrade)', ""I am pretty particularly with games I play but Idle heroes is a lot of fun. it has enough to do each day for continuous engagement and it doesn't feel like its pay to win. there is obviously lots of things you could dump a lot of money in to get the best of everything but you dont feel like you need to in order to have fun."", ""I installed, played and enjoyed the game till I reached lvl 60+...but there is one week since I can't log on my Google account.. I reinstalled my game twice.. I reported to the developers.. And nothing.. No solution.. No answer.. I use two sources of Internet provider.. I logged in a new account with my Facebook account.. And it worked.. But I don't want to start from the beginning.. I really liked the game.. But is frustrating to spend time playing to level,and then to lose your account.."", 'Not much to do on this game. Gets repetitive fast. Good time killer. I login a few times per day for 10-15 mins. (Basically for the daily reset, and every 8 hours). There is lots of strategy involved in creating the best hero teams. I really enjoy the game. Just wish there was more to do.', ""I have been playing the game for about a year now and I'm completely addicted tho one suggestion I have is to make a story to the campaign. Personally I dont think I HAVE to by things to progress it'll make it go quicker if u do tho u can still do good without buying stuff, I have tho that's just because I love the game it is very possible to win in this game tho u need skill and brain juices to get better this my current view as a level 116 and I LOOOOOOoOOoOoOooooOoOoOOOoOove this game l.

Kindly assist with the retrieval of my old account as I'm not at all willing to start the game all over again and will uninstall it if this goes down the hill."", 'This game caps each battle by level. Meaning you cant fight the next battle until you reach the player level. This is incredibly frustrating. It makes each level laughably easy to beat because the player level is such a high requirment. Your player level increases over time automatically rather than by experience points like other games. This makes the game boring because it takes two days to increase your player level enough to play the next battle. So you can only play it every other day.', ""Fun, after u play for an hour you are extreamly limited to how much you can play per day. As far as TDs go it's not bad but u have to wait a set idle time befor you can progress. And its normally 1 to 2 days befor u can progress more then 4 stages.. those stages take like 10 minutes. So if you r looking for a game to log into and spend 10 minutes a day maximum. Then this is the game for you"", 'You eventually get to where you cant do anything as you cant blitz, the story mode is held back by character and theres no way to speed it up so if it takes 2 days to get the xp to move forward it takes two days. You get on collect rewards and about 10 mins play for a few days then you can move forward. Nice back up game. And whats the deal with hour cooldown for attack in abyss? The drop rate of toons isnt that great. Put every diamond ive tiched into opening pacts and have little to show for.', 'One of the best idle games ever...... As you will have many options for upgradations and merging of heroes to become more powerful an overall exciting game. My only request to the developers is not to make the rebattle in an auto mode. As players could have option in the lower levels to choose the fraction and powers of the heroes by repeating the same battle ,,, if autobattle is utmost nessasary then you could keep it as an option but make the rebattle as an option too......', 'I loved this game, just started 2 days ago, went to get on and it asked for my login for the very first time, now my games gone. I was a couple bucks away from vip4. Had multiple heroes lvld to 70 with the 1 purple star ranking. Would rate a 5 if i was able to get my account back.', ""The graphics and gameplay is really nice IF u can play at all. Why can't we grind for items/exp or character shards/game currency by REPLAYING the same stage in TD. This stupid level requirement is just plain waste of time. Every time i level up i can only play 3 more times then i have to wait for another 10hrs. This is just a major turn off."", ""Loved the game and spent money on it too. Was playing earlier today and not sure what happened but when I try to play now it's requiring me to log in, even though my account was connected to my GooglePlay. Nothing seems to work."", 'Been playing for a few weeks now I love it one of the best mobile games I have played, however i have just tried to play and now I need a username and password never needed this before also I never made a username and password this is the only reason for the 3 stars otherwise it would be 5', ""Great game!! but, I am stuck on level 21-7 and I have to wait 4 days before I can move on to the next level because I don't have enough ex points. That's the only sucky thing about it for me I see. Can you PLEASE fix so I can really enjoy the game even more. If you fix that it will definitely get 5+ stars from me. Thanks much!!"", 'Rather amazing till the 3rd day. This game would be a 5 star but after 4 days of playing #1 issue.. after flying through the campaign and it wasnt super easy they stall you saying you must level up to continue . Thats horrible why should i now have to wait 19 hours before i can do anything. You get to a point where you need campaign gold and items to beat the bosses and other stages. Easy improvment not forcing someone to wait for exp. I wanna play this dont give me reasons not too...', 'Personally my favorite idle rpgs game, totally possible to progress without paying money and no ads. As long as you learn to save supplies until events, you can get some truly incredible free gear, heroes, and more. Still love it after three months of playing and learning new stuff all the time, highly recommended', ""I've played for a while. Giving 5 star because even though I've restarted twice I can still progress without spending real money. All I wish is that they would link account s between Android and apple. Because my Apple account was lvl110 but can't log into it on my new Android phone. Restarting game and still re-enjoying the experience."", ""Another pay to advance game. Also, game mechanics are a little out of wack. When a power level 5000+ goes against a PL of 3000, who do you think would win. You're right, the 3000 power level. What? Why advance if you're just going to be trashed by lower level players? An added note. After writing this review, my game reset to the beginning. I lost everything I had built up. Don't recommend this game to anyone."", 'Edit: The bug was fixed and the game is once again awesome. The game is fantastic. However, I am no longer able to access it via google account. Facebook login is functional but that restarts the game from the beginning and I am not about losing all that progress time and money. Please investigate your google log on process.', 'Once you get into the game you find out its paywalled. Dev says its all free but what he doesnt tell you is you have to log in every 8 hours for 3 days straight just to get enough for 1 upgrade. So unless you want to watch grass grow for 3 days than you have to spend. They know this but want to lie and say its not a paywall. I dont know a single gamer that would call that gaming or playing. Its not anywhere close to reasonable. Devs know your going to get tired of waiting and spend. Uninstalled', 'Fun game. This is the 2nd time i have played from the start by choice. Last time was well over lvl 100. Always something to do and always a competition being played. I would love to financialy support them but a lot of the packages are a little pricey for me. Maybe soon as I really do enjoy this game. No adds though which is always a huge plus, hence the higher price purchases for the adds im guessing.', ""-Unfortunately the other reviews are right. I got stuck on a pay wall the first day playing, decided to give it a chance and wait for today. Played for another 10 min then hit another wall. -It would be a great game but you can't do much without paying and the prices are pretty crazy $19.99 will keep you going for a bit but anything lower and you'll hit another wall. -1 thing I forgot, to be fair to the creators, you can pass a pay wall with the afk bonuses, but that means 10 min per 24 hours"", 'Great game with a great staff. The TD levels are varied and never feel unfair, while also having plenty more to do including VS pvp. The premium currency used to get new heroes and stuff is very easy to get even without paying for it, allowing you to constantly be upgrading your team and gaining new heroes. The best thing though is the staff. They are consistently updating and upgrading the game, and are quick to help with any problems that may arise. Def worth the download!', 'The game is fun. Needs a lot of improvements like: -Needs Private Chat/Mail for Friends or Clan -Clan Ranking would be nice to have -Time stamps on messages in chats is missing -Chat blocks out words like ""Hello"" says its offensive -More clan activities -VIP doesnt really explain the perks These just a few. Otherwise it\'s a fun game that\'s very similar to Idle Heros.', 'Enjoyed this game got to lev 67 great gods alot of time played then all of a sudden when i went to log in the game said i have 4resourses to download 4mb after update my profile has dissapeard and started fresh very disappointed as do enjoy the game if you can recover my account would be greatfull if not then i will delete this game i am not starting all over again.']"

Banditos","[""This game is so fun. There are a bunch of different characters to collect but not so many that it feels unachievable. I have seen a lot of reviews complaining about pay to win but it really isn't that way at all. I've been playing for about a month and have teams that can easily compete in the arenas. I'm not the best by any means but good enough to get nice rewards. There are no characters you need to pay money for. I can't wait for new content though so I did pay just to support the devs."", ""Really liked this game but a couple days in and I've hit a wall. Events are completely stacked with high level players. Game is currently a slow grind. Investing in mines and expeditions does help. Additional details on character builds would be useful. There is a lot to like about this game. Looking forward to new releases and content."", 'Fun game to kill some time on your phone. There have been several content updates in the short time I have played this game. The dev team also seems to be working very hard to improve this game. I thought that I had an issue so I email the dev team with a question. They responded very quickly and let me know what was going on with my file.', ""Wow don't try to participate in any of the events, The arena and the golden vale are for pros only. Kind of makes wish I hadn't spent anything on the game. Any of the events that involve playing against other players are dominated by the same couple of people. There's really no point in playing when you get to that point. Seemed like a great game till that."", ""Extremely pay to win. Even mid game you need max level heroes in gold star range to take on most enemy groupings. Enemy scaling is a mess too, you'll go directly from from quick battling everything to losing with regular fighting because the enemies tripled damage output in two fights. Using all your skill points on a max level party member is hundreds of thousands of gold plus literally days of time. Considering mines only make you a few hundred gold at a shot (for hours of waiting), good luck."", ""Really digging this game. It's not overly complicated and yet still manages to capture enjoyable game play and strategy. Progressing does feel somewhat linked to the ability to upgrade rather than the level of the card which has added some grinding to the game but over all i dont feel i have to continuously drop currency to enjoy it"", 'Love this game! Great Free to Play tactics game! Extremely minimal ads. The only thing I would suggest is a little bit more of a tutorial in the beginning, or some sort of glossary that people can look at if they want to.', ""It's fun. Lots of continuous play without having to pay to play. Do get stuck once in a while but leveling characters constantly for stronger battles helps! Enjoying this game."", ""Eh. It's a good game, fun and easy to play. Progression through the game is a massive grind fest when you get so far and it's either pay to advance or grind out weeks at a time... so... eh. A game that makes it so the player can grind out about $5 worth of in-game currency every day or so would help with the progression speed. In the end it's worth playing, but gets slow going."", 'Fantastic game! I had one bug and after I contacted them they resolved the issue in less than 24 hours. You guys earned the money I spent to thank you.', ""Great game, there are some imbalances such as how many times you miss even though the hit rate is so high. Gold mines should yield a bit more gold, I know you can level them up but with the costs of upgrades it's pretty crazy. These are not deal breakers however. I'm a fan of strategy type games, this game gives me a feel of the old Final Fantasy Tactics and Fire Emblems. Also support is super responsive and keeps you up to date on the status of your cases rather quickly. Overall I'm satisfied."", 'Love the game, have been playing for a few weeks now. Since this new update now game goes to loading screen then crashes and wont let me play. Please fix', 'Too hard! Cost too much gold. Paid to win style game! Seems like it could be fun, but not at cost they want you to pay!', ""Great turn based adventure game with lots to explore. I felt the early game was a little unnecessarily tough though. Little to no explanation on campaign vs arena vs quests (yes that's different from campaign) and so on. In early game many battles are tough and it takes a while to heal your party and collect new heros. Once you get ~7 though the game starts rolling and gets pretty interesting."", ""It's a fun game, but has massive pay wall. Definitely a fun time killer, but the 40 foot pay wall is ridiculous. To advance, you need to train your heroes. Pay gold to train in the training hall which makes sense. Unfortunately, you can expect 45-100 gold per mission, and it costs upwards of 40k gold to train just one hero. That just sucks all the fun out of the game for me."", ""Pros. Lots of characters = lots of variety. As you open up more areas there are more opportunities to train your army. Battle moves quickly but still involves strategy. Cons. Bit of a grind, which I enjoy but others might find frustrating, especially in the beginning when you only have 2 or 3 areas to train and they take hours to refresh. Strategy can be a bit obtuse. Each class has things they are strong and weak against and it's hard to keep track sometimes. I like this game a lot."", ""Might be one of the coolest and best RPG phone games I've played. Has enough action to keep you coming back. There is a good amount of strategy involved with which heroes to use. The part I like the most is the grind to level characters. In a true RPG, be ready to grind for stuff and this game hits it on the head. Just enough grinding to were you're not pulling your hair out but also just enough where your characters don't get overpowered quickly. Awesome work guys and keep it coming!!"", ""Good game but i changed my time in my phone due to timezones, when i played again, all my heroes in golden vale are locked and cannot be retrieved, also my mines are bugged, endless swarm of enemies each time i log back in instead of the 4 hours cooldown per wave, my green potions also seem to disappear.I've tried logging off and on, exit all apps and giving a device maintenance, uninstalling and reinstalling but nothing worked. Pls fix Edit: Its fixed now, pls put more defenses for time change"", 'Edit* I found the info button thank you :) I think this is a great RPG game. Pretty simple, easy to learn, and strategy will win over brute power. I would like to see descriptions of stats in the training/upgrade screen. Some of the icons I have to guess as to what they mean.', ""Fun game but if you are new don't bother with events, you will be against players double your level."", 'Be better if you could actually go to arena or go to gold mines without people way higher then you. Have to pay gems to even get anywhere...', ""Not the biggest fan of the art style but that's a personal preference. Don't let that be a factor though, as the gameplay mechanics ticks pretty much all the boxes possible. Reminds a LOT of the old Heroes of Might and Magic. The game would benefit from extensive tutorial for battles, the different elements and turn order. It's not very apparent at first but you will discover those things gradually. Also the ability to attack the enemy from different direction should be there, not just head on."", ""92% accuracy really means 40% accuracy. Even fighting opponents lower level than you. The ranged characters for me seem to be the biggest offenders. For example I missed a level 2 skull person 4 times in a row (between an earth mage and ranger) in the same fight before finally hitting him with my paladin. All my people were lvl 7ish at the time. I still play so it's a great concept just irksome about the accuracy issues."", 'I believe I\'m done with the ""tutorial"" and so far, so good.. Previous five star reviews seem spot on, Definently nails the old school RPG vibe and mixes in the classic heroes mechanics beautifully. Developers are great about not shoving the shiny paid content down your throat every two minutes👍, it also appears you really can access the majority of the content without spending a dime if you\'re willing to grind it out. ⚔ Sure that wont get tedious ⚔', 'Get charged but in app says purchase failed. Yet they had no problem charging. Cant do anything leaderboard based as it says i must connect to internet...yet here i am rating the poor excuse for a game', ""Love this game I'm glad I redownload. My one thing I would like to see is with the campaigns. It would be cool if once you finished a campaign you could recruit a second person from that (like a second kings warrior) and train another one. I understand you want to keep them unique. Another cool option would be to have a place where you can sell hero gems for coins or maybe a place to trade them in for others."", ""This would be a good game for the exception that any time you upgrade a character they become unusable in your group for a length of time. Horrible game mechanic that I've never seen before for a game of this genre. Basically, if you upgrade a group member you can just close the game and go do something else....like uninstall the game."", ""Same small group of players dominate every aspect of game at a certain point. Not fun to play because of this. I've seen 3-5 players dominate their Vale event which brings in game gold. This allows them to dominate all other areas by out spending and buying player upgrades to continue to stock up on heroes which in turn lets them further dominate everyone even more so"", ""Good game would give five stars but challenges in quest tab are unrealistically difficult. fought a level 9 challenge with a level 16/3 star, a level 25/5 star and level 16/4 star and didnt have a chance. Either change level of challenge or raise requirements to play. I don't know if those characters can ever complete the challenge. Also very difficult quests given right at beginning with no chance to complete. Overall though fun game."", ""Really enjoyable! So addictive. Haven't had to spend a penny and still having fun!"", 'I really love this game. The characters and art style are great. (Son of a witch anyone?) Unfortunately, the recent patch made this game unplayable on my s8. The game just wont load. Even so, if it works, definitely worth a play! Edit: they fixed it! This game is great!', 'The changes they have made has made this game way more ptp then ftp. They nerfed upgrading heroes by getting rid of the instant upgrade and replaced with a very expensive upgrade so you can have more guys training at the same time. They got rid of instant chest and changed it with an upgrade 8 times as expensive instant key upgrade. And then some of the challenges have been changed so that they are now impossible to get your guys to the enemies before they are shot dead behind their fortress.', 'Added a star for the scout map unnerfing (still not equal to what was before but I can now play the game for a bit longer between breaks). I still dont like the new personal and online quests. The bonuses are low if you are not top 5 of their group and to be top 5 requires p2w. Even the personal quests seem to require p2w. Maybe that will improve as I progress. Store items that replaced the timer based bonuses are significanty more expensive for less benefit. Dev responsiveness is amazing!', 'Very unique in style. Really like being able to autoplay battles. Level progression and team building is a little slow compared to how many points of interests there are to hold and collect over time.

Keep it up heroes mobile: World War Z', ""I love this game, it's my favorite game of all time, I love almost everything on this game, and one of my favorite is donating, but in donating you either spend a lot of gems or mess up your troop training. I always use quick train, and if I donate troops from my camps, it messes up my whole entire quick train, and I don't want to spend all my gems just to give someone a couple troops. I think there needs to be a separate army camp that has a barracks attached to it, and you can train troops to fill that army camp, you also can't use the troops from that army camp to attack, you can only use those troops to donate, the barracks attached to the camp is always at the same level as your highest leveled barracks you have, please take my suggestions into mind and try to work on this in the next update."", 'The only game, and I mean ONLY game that has ever held my attention for an extended time. I’ve played virtually every one of the standard strategy games (Game of War, Hobbit KoM, etc) and I lose interest eventually. However, this game has variety, difficulty, balance, and strategy. One of the greatest games ever brought to the app store.', 'Everything in this game is great. I had my whole family play they loved it everyone who played this liked it at least everyone I know. I think if you like the 2D base games you will love it. They make updates regularly especially on holidays and also make new troops. If you think you don’t like it try it first I promise you as soon as you start you can’t stop. The only thing is the upgrades are long but it’s a 2D game what do you expect. Please try it out I think you will like it.', 'I love the game very much, but I have an idea. The wait for the building is long, but that’s good so people will buy gems and u guys can make a living. How bout have two builders work on one building and have it as half the time so it goes faster and if someone wants to build something else then that one builder can leave that site and movie to the next building. Other wise great game keep heading the right direction.', 'I really like this COC-like game, I just recently got into the game because of a friend. I think it would be really cool if there was an option to attack your own village with your troops, to test you base design out. Not having to train them or anything but obviously keep the same capacity and levels that you have. I think it would be interesting to see how my village would last against myself. Anyways thanks for all the fun', 'It is a great game! You start out in a broken down weak village. Spend time building and upgrading your village, by collecting resources. You collect resources from collectors for gold and elixir in your village. And you also defend your base against other attacking players. You can also attack bases yourself getting trophies along the way to rank up. After your village gets experienced you can join a clan. And In that clan battle with other clan members in clan wars. However I don’t recommend this game if you are low on time, it is time consuming. And I’m happy that it’s still developer supported.', ""This is very good game same like coc play this game . Very nice game will I get the game play this game and enjoy too much this game so good for children's you can also play this game in absence of town hall in c o c there is command and it's all likes you see you like this game only play one time here you will get heroes and you will do attack and get coins from that place enjoy this game so much that is why we rate 5 stars you also play this game and give five star to this game join our Clan."", 'Love the game! The game got a lot more fun with the builder hall update. I’m only town hall 8 but I’ve been enjoying it the whole way through. I feel that the upgrade time could be a little bit less, mainly because whenever I’m upgrading things that take 3-4 days, I’m afraid to attack because I’ll get attacked.', ""It's a very good game it's like clash of clans but kind of better just keep up the good work and the game might be better.♥️👍"", 'I really like the game there’s a lot of great content, being able to not only level a home village and a builder base there is a lot more competition. I like how the systems work how you are available to be attacked for your home village but you are given the option to battle and to be battled when you would like for your builder base.', 'Its a good game I really like the super heroes. I can see myself playing this game often. Keep on adding new things and events please', 'I love this game so much it’s really fun but one thing you should change is the bomb towers. They can only attack ground troops but they are towers and should be able to attack air Troops as well. And one more thing, you should really make the upgrade time a little shorter. Not the cost just the upgrade time.', 'Great game but there has to be a easier function for the game when you have to build a base, food for thought! Set up a function that would allow us to download the base we would like to build from off the internet then download it into the game and the base would be built and then place the defense and everything else where wanted.', 'It’s a very good game; molding strategy and cooperation between clan mates together with fun graphics and events creates fun gameplay for everyone. A few minor things could be added to both improve the gameplay and make it more fun - being able to block unwanted players from a clan, which could allow clans to have play and not worry about suspicious/annoying players. Also, one addition that would be helpful is making it so that you don’t have to re-train your Tripp’s after story mode attacks, which could make multiplayer gameplay easier to access while still getting achievements in story mode. Adding restrictions like providing players with specific troops to use instead making players use their own armies would be a good idea. That change could expose newer players to higher level troops, improving strategy and experience. Lastly, one possible addition could be adding a chat room for high level players to give advice on gameplay and strategy so newer players can improve their bases and attacks.', 'It’s fun and well supported. My favorite thing about this game is that you don’t have to spend any money to progress. I have never spent one dollar on in app purchases and I am a very high level and maxed out base. Money will get your there faster but they don’t force you to spend money to progress all the way to the top.', 'Good game after all but please make mail such as defense log and attack log can be delete that all game is already perfect I hope it tq.', 'This is the best game ever. It is so fun and the team is always trying to make new ideas and they make fun things every time there is an event. Now, if you do not want a game that you will be addicted to until you max every thing you can then this is not a game for you. However, anyone should try this game because this is the best game ever', 'Love the consistent updates and great new troops. Just one request I feel like a lot of people aren’t as active in the clan games and the cap for points is 4,000 points and I did that in like by the first day after clan games started; if possible I would like to see the CAP on that higher or no CAP at all... keep on doing your thing!!!!!', 'An all around great game. The clan leagues are fun, but they would be better if you could choose normal or leagues. Also, you should take away the feature where you have to build every building from a townhall before you can upgrade. By that’s my only qualm. clash on everyone.', 'This game is packed with exciting and challenging events around every corner. The game is literally full of all types of team effort events and is always challenging you to push to the next level and is so addicting from day one to several hrs down the road and counting! Way to go the team for putting a great game together. You must try this game and see for your self, you can’t go wrong! From my clan family to you...welcome!!', 'Nice Graphics with Smooth internet Connection. Troops Upgrading with Talent Points and Heroes Upgrading with Different Skills is an Unique idea which makes this Game very different to other Games like Clash of clan.. This Game really deserve 5 Star Rating.', 'Great game so far, not getting heroes very fast, the selectuon is rather small from what ive seen, but the gameplay itself is fun, and you dont need many heroes.', 'Utter disregard for players, outright idiotic troop priorities (AI), and pay to win attempts no bum would attempt that dumb. Lack of AI, when it comes to players having to do all the micromanagement manually. Disgusting.', 'I loved playing this game a lot. But please add a update in which we could play friendly battles among our league members. So we spend more time playing this game.😉😉', 'I would recommend this to anyone who likes strategy games! And this is not a pay to win game. You can purchase gems but it just makes you get forward in the game. This game is awesome!!! And Addicting. One of my favorite mobile games ever! This game deserves to be in a hall of fame game list.', 'It is good but there are many things that bored me I think you should try to use better game and that game is CLASH OF CLANS. It is the best game ever I had been played', ""Gaming concept is good, and easy to get all, and free to play, but i would like to give you 1 star because game too much lags, sometimes texting into clan getting game slower, and while attacking have also same issue to much lag, can't play properly! Need to fix that lagging issue, otherwise can't play!"", ""Game is full of glitches. I've had people attack my base and get one star but get credited three stars. Ive had hundreds of gems disappear, constant disconnects, freezes, etc. The game support does a horrible job and ignores your problem and tries to give you 50 gems as an apology, which doesnt fix the issue. ive actually spent real money on this game and it was fun while it lasted, but the creators of this game ignore its glitches and thats horrible.

There are so many things that suck the fun right out of this game. And, it\'s such a shame to see it come from the makers of one of the best OG missile defense games. • Buildings take WAY to long to upgrade. I shouldn\'t be able to max out my resources (gold, lumber, food; all maxed out at 10k) before I have the chance to meaningfully use them. What am I supposed to do with my resources while I stare at 2, and only 2 workers, taking 30+ minutes to upgrade 1 building a piece? I\'m tempted to set 2 buildings for upgrade, then just close the game and find something else to do until I eventually feel like opening the game again. But, what\'s the point of keeping a game like that? Speaking of workers... • 750 gems to buy just 1 more worker??? Effing ridiculous. I\'d pay for a game (entire game) that had faster gameplay. The road to earning that many gems is truly depressing when you only get 2 or 5 gems per Achievement. • The battles aren\'t even really fun. They\'re mundane at best. Don\'t get me wrong, the artwork and overall graphics are excellent. But, ""battles"" just seem too elementary. Everything feels watered down. The difficulty setting is definitely set to Easy. There are other things that need to be addressed about this game, but this review is already too long. For those that enjoy this game, I\'m genuinely glad you do. Personally, I don\'t like being roped along, while being pushed into a corner where my only way out is to be nickel\'d and dime\'d.

・Removed Auto-renewable subscriptions
・Various other bug fixes and improvements","[""Basically it's a good game. The warship seasons don't last long enough. It should last TWICE as long or TRIPLE as long. They don't have hints on how to get the really hard bases. You have to find someone who can get those hard bases and ask them to share the attacks. When someone steals your resource base, they don't show their attack. It gets frustrating at times, having to give up getting a base. Need hints for a few days after each home base update."", ""Awesome game, regularly updated and works flawlessly and its a great casual game, easy to spend just 5 min or 50 min in game. Have played it for many years since it first came out and its only gotten better with time. The Warships mode isnt for me personally, but I'm still glad they continually try to innovate and make the game better than it used to be. The play style is extremely flexible, literally a style for everyone, even the pacifist who doesnt like fighting, just harvest your resources."", ""It's a pretty fun game; I've been playing it for 2 years or so. It's a cute distraction. 6 months ago I the game would crash suddenly, saying that the server had become disconnected. And I would lose whatever progress I was making in a battle. Very frustrating. The developers should fix this glitch, or at least give us a win for every battle that we start before the system glitches out."", ""You need to update this game add more areas to unlock when you're maxed out you can't do anything except lose your money to other people that decide that they want to play against you. You should just add a whole new area that you can go in and invade and get rid of capping on all your stuff make him upgradable more add more things add on to your Island do something this game needs a total revamp I've been playing it since day one I'm at the point where I may be open it up once a month now becau"", 'The game as a whole is ok. Unfortunately, the devs of late have been lapse. The gameplay of warship is unfair, you constantly get put against opponents that are far stronger and have unlocked warriors and abilities you do not possess, there is no way to win. I will no longer be playing the warship part of the game and will no longer spend any money on the game as a whole. Congratulations...', ""FIX THE GLITCH! In the WarShip you are no longer able to win any chests. The ones down on the bottom left-hand corner do not count anymore when you win. They remain the same. I've lost so much reward from that glitch. I've uninstalled and reinstalled the application and i'm still not getting the reward. It's been about a month now without ANY reward."", 'very fun very fresh and very addicting. This game has so many different things about it that makes it a great game. My favorite is how easy it is to build a great base in such little time. There are no bugs, glitches, or crashing. This is a well-rounded encentric game and I recommend to anyone looking for some leisure time that is worth while or for anyone who wants to experience an action packed yet calming game.', ""Very fun but my only problem is I can't really. Enjoy my resource islands to the full extent I could've, three of mine are stale mates like permenantly I guess cuz they are lvl 4 while I'm already a lvl 31so idk if the other players quite the game or something but I wish I could fight someone back and forth for them again, kinda lost some charm in the game."", ""Warships is no good for seasoned players. I've played every season so far.. and it's impossible to get going. I and many others are just stuck throwing matches until we drop down to a reasonable level. And then what? We all just race to get the heavy helicopter? Wow.. that was fun at first, but it's really taken actual creative playing out of the game."", 'This game is AMAZING!!! It is so fun and omce you get to hq level 8 you can do so much and it doesnt take long to get there. There is so much to do too. You can join task forces (join mine its bombs awayyyyyyyyy) but you also have a alter base with all the best defenses and offesnes and you just battle and unlock rewards. And in task forces you start operations which everyone in the force works together to beat the 2-7 bases. I would defintly recomend this game.', 'I loved playing this game and was in a GREAT task force until the update in December. Now I cant play it because when I open it, it closes and says"" unfortunately boom beach has stopped"". I\'ve tried uninstalling it and reinstalling it several times and it still does the same thing. I\'ve tried EVERYTHING!!!!! Thanks for taking the game away from me supercel', ""Enjoyable game with annoying bug - if I lose signal, even if I get signal back a few seconds later it won't let me actively continue the battle I am in, the battle just continues on its own. This is most annoying in warship if I lose signal before deploying troops as it means I automatically lose as I can't go back to the battle and deploy then - even when I get signal before the battle has finished. Not sure if this affects others too? Makes playing very frustrating in places with poor signal."", ""update sucks! everyone you get paired up with is grossly better equipped than you are. totally unfair way they match you up with opponents.update. I posted this a while ago and this issue still hasn't been fixed, especially when you get a new engine room. I'm constantly getting matched up with people who are 4 or 5 spots higher than me on the upgrade tree."", 'This game is amazing over all. PLEASE SUPERCELL HEAR ME OUT! I\'ve been supporting your game for a very long time now, creating other account and play actively before. Every since your term support and service amazes me. BUT NOW! It seems that your so called easy way to switch between account aka suppercell ID isn\'t helpful at all! I\'ve been try to switch between account for a while no but for some reason when I typed in the code it says ""GAME ACCOUNT EAS NOT FOUND. PLEADE USE ANOTHER ACC!""', ""Warships again become a farce. Rather than being about troop selection, tactics and skill. It again is just a case of who can fire their guns the fastest. Very disappointing again. Thought this would have been resolved as every previous season has been like this, but alas, this season is the same. It's just a waste of time playing the Warship side of the game"", ""I have been playing this game since maybe 2015, and it was great alllll the way up until NOW. This game is controlled in ways I never knew til now. I'm really starting to notice alot of weird things about this game. Warships is one, it's like no matter what i do and how fast i get done the opponent seems to ALWAYS win, it's RIDICULOUS!!!! With all that said I am gonna separate myself, because I don't feel like I'm getting a fair chance. So I HAVE TO uninstall."", 'Good game but need alot of improvements, i got a draw acouple of times on the new battleships mode and how is that even possible when i have destroy the opponent and have even watch when opponent still has 1 engine to destroy and i still get a draw???! Needs to fix that getting anoyed with that', 'The game is fun but i wish we could play a mini game that would cost coins or gold. You would drop something and it the ball you dropped would collect points if it touched the point bubbles and whatever it adds up to would be the amount of time it takes away from what you are upgrading or the amount of time with training the soldiors.', ""warships was a great way to expand the gameplay. And I enjoy watching my base grow stronger over time. Very intuitive and strategic gameplay. Supercell has a knack for doing extremely well in the app/mobile game industry . I only complain that I cannot get my Google play games to connect. But that's a personal issue and has nothing to do with the development teams amazing work and doesn't make the game any less enjoyable and fun."", 'This is a great game wish you could buy it. What a rip-off to want me there pay 99.00 dollars for fake crystals. I love this game but not the purchase part of none real items. Let me buy the game and find the things I need. My console game are not even 99.00 dollars. There is so many other ways that do this, it all the purchases not just the 99 dollar one. Thanks. Why do I lose progress on bases I can not defend', 'Game was good at one time. Now they try to make it almost impossible to defend to keep people playing. Instead of improving an equal part defense/offense, they launch warships which is terrible. Game used to be so fun. Now everything geared toward money. The new stuff getting too stretched. Sad to see it go. Task force players almost non existent anymore', ""The game is incredible well made, very entertaining but it is drown back by the thing that it's entirely pay to win. You can play free of charge but you need to be a veeeeery patient person and play for years to reach high levels. I understand that the developers needs to gain some money from this, that they don't work for free but in this game it's just ridiculous. The game its made in such way that it forces you to pay so you won't loose what you worked for such a long time."", 'Loved this game for a while. Thought the new battleship idea would be awesome. Then i find out that the game and designers have no problem with cheaters. I brought it to the attention of the support group and all they said was, ""unfortunately we can\'t help you with that, contact us if you have questions regarding a different subject.... Genius....😒🙄', 'Ive been playing for 5 years. It was fun, and very very addictive, which is the only thing that kept me going. This game is only for people who can spend money on premium currency. I cant, I wont. Boom Beach just wants your money, the developers always have these stupid offers, and i mean ALWAYS. In warships the matching system is ok, but when i destroy their engines or whatever before them, usually 10-20 secs, they still win. Cruel, and stressful. Dont play, if you cant pay. The devs dont care.', 'Without a doubt the worst season of warships. The fully upgraded rifleman, which used to be formidable, is now brought down by anything. The warrior wont go under tje smoke to a target and if he does defenses keep shooting like theres no smoke there. So i have troops that drop if u yell at them facing fully upgraded defenses. No way to win let alone destroy 8 engines to get upgrade tokens. Quit playin cause theres no point. I was an everyday player, a spend money player. No more', 'Dear Developer, Please Add another option on buying additional builder, like using gems, this might help all newbie to have motivation on playing this game. Just like in clash of clans. Will rate 5 stars plus invite friends to play this app. if this was implemented. Sincerely yours, -newbie-', ""This a great game of you are looking for some challenge and strategical game!! Whether playing on warship or in task force, there is always something to do. The only problem there is that it's hard to make changes to your bases, after you get new buildings. Please consider adding an edit mode where you can edit freely and easily."", ""Don't be fooled, it's pay to play! Without instant troops you must wait ridiculous amounts of time for your troops to, you know, play the game again. You may ask why not log off and come back? Good question! The answer is if your logged off you can be attacked and lose your resources for upgrades. Good game but just awful way it's set up. The new warships is full of bugs and players game the system to make top ranks. Only thing fun is ops and that's once a day for 2 minutes. Terribly run game."", ""Whenever I do something, whether it be an attack, an upgrade, a build, anything I find that if I come after sometime it shows that I didn't do it at all. When I attacked, I completed the attack and still had a few troops left. After logging in again, it showed that I hadn't attacked and all my troops were for some reason gone"", ""I'd give a lower rating if I could. Worst matchmaking system I've encountered and so many glitches that take forever to fix. I've only played over a month (hq14 lv38 with subscriptions) and am already getting constantly matched with capped out main and resource bases (hq23 lv66). Don't waste your time and/or money on this game like I did, better yet just avoid Supercell games altogether. Its unethical how terrible they disregard player satisfaction with how much they make."", 'Great time killer. Great team mates. To easy to loose your base. All special defences can be wiped with tricks and ease or by attackers boosting to 300power and or health while freezing your defences. Silly to say the least. From 5 star to 3 for becoming stagnant. Battle ship is the exact game as BB its self. Crab is a fun run within our clan most of the time. But again why have defences you can freeze hack and smoke all at the same time.', ""Game quite good, obviously if you spend lots of cash you can buy your way to a superior force, and kid yourself you are good. For the last couple of months the the connection to site has been erratic, connection failed error several times an hour, never used to be a problem when the game was new. Two star's deduction for this."", ""I enjoy the original game, and like the idea of the warships portion of the game. Unfortunately the warship portion tends to be drastically mismatched and getting worse rather than better. I even stepped away altogether for a while over it. Hopefully you'll figure this problem out before I just delete the game from my phone completely."", ""Right before I updated this I was in the middle of attacking a resource base and it told me I lost connection so I immedately tried to reconnect and it worked but the island owner was online and I couldn't attack the base. Are you supposed to be kicked from battle when the island owner comes online?"", ""Game designed solely for players prepared to pay huge amounts for jewels. Without jewels you cannot compete. Everything is weighted against the player from upgrades to opponents to ranking etc. Great game if you are very rich and can purchase 1000's of lewels."", ""I've also played boom beach for a long time since 2015 or so. But this warship is not worth it, I have whooped ALOT of these bases and guess what, I still lost wth, fix it, because I'm sure half these players don't even deserve there trophies they got. Such a RIP off this game. I like winning as much as the next person and it feels good to win and climb to the top but with this rip off game....please save your time and energy and play another game......So disappointing!!!!! REALTALK!!!!"", 'Fun but too expensive. Supercell could make it affordable and still bring in revenue. Be prepared to spend a couple thousand USD to unlock any real advancement or fun. The game itself is great, design, story, etc. The whole idea is great just dont see how its worth a couple thousand dollars', ""2018... Great game BUT when you complete it,it's finished... Level 65 HQ 22 all troops maxed ... nowhere else to go, no more levels... Game Over :( SC should introduce higher levels to keep people playing / interested Almost 2020 ... At last HQ23!!!! Maybe too little too late. A lot of people have finished playing BB having maxed their bases a long time ago... They should've kept the momentum going like they have done in Clash continually. .."", ""It's fun, but has some issues. The first is that you can get attacked by people way stronger than you. I just got my base destroyed by someone 2 levels above me, they had zooka's and way more soldiers and I can't even attack them back when I have better stuff, they are just gone with 5 hours of base raiding worth of resources. Thank you, for ruining my day the second it starts, someone had to do it I guess"", ""It's an amazing game. Almost similar to coc But I'd suggest instead of just saving your layout I'd actually like to edit the layout like it does in clash of clans other than that the games amazing. I hope to see it added into boom beach someday.""]"

Everything about this game is fun from the building of characters and having to learn just how strong they can be to the items that you need to use.

As if that\'s even it\'s business in the first place. If I was using the actual VPN, on an *active* connection to the resource it was protecting, then I could accept it. But not a Token Generator. For that matter, why am I apparently unable to use the 2FA TOTP generator of my choice (which, by the way, takes up only about 12% of the space that this one does; has an easier-to-use interface; and was developed and released by Red Hat).

2.Fixed some bugs.","[""This game is so cool, there is literally nothing bad I can say about it except ... that I have a suggestion to make. What if you could make a list of things that you want your builders to do in order. So that if you don't have Internet then you can know that those things are done. Plus I think that when you collect from one mine all the mines should collect at once, almost like COC. If you like these ideas, then please take it into consideration. Anyways... Keep up the good work and thank you."", ""I love the games idea because I enjoy it and I find it quite fun but the only problem is the buffer,every 20 secs I will buffer for a min and it's really annoying and it always kicks me off and says sorry your you have no internet connection even when my internet connection is absolutely brilliant I don't like this and it brings the game down and runs the gameplay,please fix this issue"", 'Im not saying i hate this game or this game is trash,but the developer should change when you surrender all your heroes die even the one that is not dead yet.i found that very annoying because when you accidentally click on a base that you dont wanna raid you normally just surrender so then you dont have to wait for your heroes to recover... You should fix that and then i gave you 5 star rating. (only recover the ones that didint die on the raid,if the heroes die it dies)', 'This game is very fun and yes,I do reccomend,however,the constant buffering is very annoying:whatever I do it starts to buffer every 4-5mins.pls fix this bug for a 5-star rating.', 'Blatant ripoff of Clash Of Lords. The controls are weird, the heroes are weird, everything is just dumb. Download Clash of Lords instead, its actually a good game.', 'My first review was taken down. just why, I left it to help you. anyway played the game for about a week and its ""Ok"" I like the clash of zombies game they have more but Nobody in that game is English. make this game, look like that game. honestly clash of zombies is better it looks better flows better its just better but no English. make this game like you made that game', 'I have been playing for a long time and yes I may have used some of my money but castle clash is not at all a p2w game. There is so many ways you can get good hero’s and most of my best hero’s I got for free. But I do have to admit it is ok spending some money but a word of caution be careful you might think “ I need to get better so I’m going to spend $100 on gems”. You can get more heroes for free in Clash of Leagues: Heroes Rising.', 'I love the game I’ve played for 3 weeks and I’ve spent 5 dollars like forever ago and it was because I wanted to finish a town hall upgrade. I have nearly every god tier hero in the game simply because I get so many free gems. The game is perfect for free to play players, and if you want to spend money instead of grinding perfect, then you can get your heroes even quicker but it doesn’t take long to get a good group of heroes they even give you legendary heroes.', 'I agree with others that you Don’t have to be a pay to play to progress to higher levels. The pay to play folks are the ones with no patience and want to level up as Fast As Possible!! I should know because I’m One Of Them! LOL I also have a F2P account that is very strong not to mention the game matches I up against people on Your Level for the most part. There are so many events, game modes, and daily gifts that even F2P can level up fast so disregard the negative reviews and Get To Clashing!!!', ""I usually don't leave reviews but I have been playing this game for three days now and I really enjoy it. Haven't spent a cent and I probably won't. Can't get enough, I wonder how long will that last"", 'I have seen alot if reviews that are bad and talk alot of junk about this game. They say its pay to win, they say all kinds of things. If you pay, you can get good items,and boosts, but you dont need to pay any ammount if money at all. A good stroke of luck can make thing amazing for you. I have been playing this game for 2 and a half years. On one account, then i stopper and then re downloaded it and i have to say this game changes alot through the yeats and tgese developers yake care of their game and do as much as they can. If you log in daily you can make gems easily if you save and you will get hooked on this game so fast. 10/10', ""I accidentally fused my best hero and can't get it back. Edit..was hoping to her back by email but never have I can't believe the game is this flawed sorry down to 3 stars"", 'This is a good game. The graphics look beautiful and the game doesn’t consume a lot of memories. If you do not get good heros then delete this account and create a new one. I play it at the spare time and not spend any pennies yet. I love this game and i think it is 5 stars.', 'Been play for a few years and have not sunk one dime into the game and never will. Not playing for upgrades makes your progress go much slower but it is enjoyable and I am in no rush. Over time they do meter out rewards and new heroes and make the game enjoyable. I would recommend the game but you will see people with better heroes and advances because they pay their hard earned money...just not me.', 'Was enjoying the game till now it will not let me log in and i tried all other apps and its just this one that wont let me log in why is this????', ""I don't know why I like the game so much, but I do. It's fun to play and explore the map while destroying enemy bases. I also like how you can design your own base. Upgrades may be a little expensive, but it's worth it to upgrade your defenses and troops. Huh, maybe I do know why I like the game after all!"", 'I’ve been playing for about one year and here is what I’ve noticed... Some players start off with more luck than others... I have two accounts and one acc had crazy high luck but the other account didn’t... after saving some gems and waiting for the proper events... my unlucky got crazy boosted and rolled the newest heroes... off does really well with this... and btw im a F2P with dove, gunslinger, and other newer heroes', 'This game is great. I don’t care what other people say. It’s possible to play the whole game without paying a single dime, and it feels great to work together with your teammates in your clan or league. I am currently a town-hall 10 and I’m still not bored of it. I’ve been playing for like 2 years!', 'Even though the game is easier to get good with in game purchases the game is still easy to get good at without them, I myself have made purchases which help a lot but I can see myself being good without them, to prove this I made a second account and I got 3 rare legendary heros without purchases, the get super good at the game purchases are highly recommended, but you can easily get as good with just some time', 'Great game, wonderful teammates and a gaming staff that quickly responds to any issue.....I mean ANY! Issue. I’ve been booming for over two years now and the players are world class. The game play is fair and new additions keep it exciting.', 'Full of enjoy.if some more heroes are added like iron Man ,Captain America,and some DC heroes then it will be a aeusome game', 'This is an excellent game, I find nothing wrong with it!!! I don’t feel like you have to p2w (play to win) it is making it really easy for new players to start with the updates in my opinion!!! Loving this game rn!', 'Great content and fun game the only you might have a problem with is people buying stuff but you can grind for most of the stuff so I give it a t star', 'You will always get your base attacked. I’m maxed out with a good base setup and still get attacked mostly by hammermem. Keep fighting and never forget. Just because your doing good in the game doesn’t mean your doing good in life. And vice versa', ""Can't play. Anytime I try it constantly says to retry login after I've tried Facebook login, guest and google play"", ""This is an amazing game! I've played for a couple years and have spent some money, however it was not necessary. You can obtain anything (aside from a few heroes) without paying for it, although it takes both patience and luck"", 'This game has a lot more stuff they can do to make it better like earning honor badges and different supplies cans be difficult at times I been play off and on for at least 2 years but worth playing better with friends so you can have scheduled stuff for like league battles!', 'Its fun and is a good strategy game. I think that everyone should play one time or another in their life, its fun for all ages, like clash of clans and clash royel.', 'I’ve been playing for a few years and it is fantastic, interactive, and a great time killer. Once you hit 65 it does lose its fun. Even with warships, I’m thinking of quitting. But like I said, a lot of fun getting to 800!', 'It keeps saying I have a network error even when I uninstall and install again it doesnt work and my network is really good its always got 5 bars.', 'Is it just me or is this game almost a complete replica of Clash of Clans? The animations, music, sound, pvp... Plus using copyrighted heroes? How legal is this game?!', 'This is one of the best games i played. This game has so many hidden features and there’s always something new in each and every update. But we should add more to the campaign like if you beat it there’s a second part!', 'Great game, I love it, but UR heroes are too hard to obtain', 'Really fun game it also won’t ask you to buy there packs all the time. The superheroes are powerful in the arena. Just battle for fun in this tower defense game.', 'I play this way too much. I no longer play any other phone games. I don’t really use the warship features, but everything else is super addicting. Never paid cash for anything and still can get far. Great game.', 'This is the greatest mobile game to ever exist. So much to do, so many options in building up hero’s, cooldown times are minimal for attacking compared to other subpar games like Clash of Clans. Simply put, an epic gaming creation.', 'I have played this game for 2 years and I absolutely love it! I have not payed a single dollar and I have a lvl 11 town hall best game ever! THANK YOU !', 'Amazing game! I have been playing for at least five weeks and it’s still just as good or better! Keep up the great work! Superheroes are rising from here!', 'First of all, I’d like to say it’s really good. Clash of Leagues: Heroes Rising is as great as Clash of Clans.', 'What a great game so much to do Events,Daily missions,cool heroes to collect free rewards and so on you should try it out']"

Yes it started out cheap, one 5 buck package then a 20 buck one. Then bam everything cost $99.

Thats the mantra of MS customer service support. They are never at fault, its always your internet connection your device, your OS version, or you in general; even when HUNDREDS of people report the same issues and problems. The game has become pure Pay-To-Win Garbage, almost every day some new and shiny garbage update that makes the stuff you bought yesterday redundant. Buy today, free tomorrow, useless next week is how the game has become. There is absolutely no balance in gameplay; the biggest spenders are constantly dominating all the events, those top three prizes we no longer bother competing for; its always the same handful of players and alliances. This is coming from a state with over 5,000 active players. So why do I play? The people in my alliance, after more than three years of playing with people, some genuine friendships have come about. The quality of your alliance will make or break the game experience for you. A good alliance will let you grow and HELP you grow and have fun within your means. Reality is you WILL have to buy packs at some point o have a meaningful game experience, maybe one every month or two, so its not that expensive a hobby if you dont let it be.

Kingdom Defense has four basic towers: Archer Turret, Knight Barrack, Stone-Thrower and Magic Dragon. Each tower has its function and strength, which is built to help to defeat certain types of monsters easier. But it can be ineffective when it comes to other opponents. Towers can be upgraded up to the fourth level. When upgraded, they gain more firepower and range to help you win the battle!
On top of that, tower defense can also be enhanced using stars earned per battle. With this new surge of power, you can customize each of them with various special effects and potentials such as boosting power, reducing skill cool-down. If you find out that the same strategy cannot be carried to the next battle, you can reset the skill tree to mold it to your heart's content.

★★★ MAGIC SYSTEM
Collect magic items such as meteor strikes, frost gems, healing wards or Gold boxes! They will significantly help you win your battles!

★★★ LEGENDARY HEROES AND KNIGHTS
One special feature Kingdom Defense can offer is the hero system. We aim to create a perfect combination of a strategy game and a role-playing game! In addition to towers and magic items, you can summon heroes and command them to help you fight off enemies.
A variety of heroes can be chosen to take to the battle: Galahad the Indomitable Warrior, Ashi the Hawkeye, Wukong, Shaman, Golem… Each of them is special on their own. Choose wisely, and you'll be the winner!

★★★ FEATURES
- Impressive Graphic with European style
- Spectacular effects
- Diverse monster system
- 12 maps and many other game modes
- Unique item system
- Strong hero system

- Further bug fixes and polish.","[""Edit 2: Update=constant, obnoxious ads! Considering quitting... Edit: two months in playing a few days in a row here and there and it's getting old. Progression (unlocking new units) is too slow, so the gameplay is getting stale. More map variety would be great too. 1st review: Fun game. Just wish there was more variety in maps, and that the progression was a bit faster and not so dependent on in-game purchases. It takes ages to gain access to a few more units."", 'The AI is ridiculously strong and the rewards are ridiculously low, as well as the waiting time to get the rewards that you earned ""3-8 hours to unlock a comet"" seriously that\'s a rip and your units upgrade super slow, so you keep loosing points as the AI grows stronger, but you stay the same so that\'s a real pain. Please make some serious changes so it isn\'t a pay to get/win/play and do so that you get the rewards immediately and not have to wait or pay to get. Besides that, the game is quite good with great graf and I really love the game style.', ""I love this game but I'm giving 2 stars due to a few things the bots in game are ridiculous and some very hard to beat also the drops are so unfair and rigged like you can guarantee that if u have all ur commit slots filled ull hit heroic commits yet when u have free slots the chances of hitting 1 are very slim... Early on the game is very additive and hard to put down but once you get to about lvl 6 or 7 it becomes a real grind and even becomes a bit boring. Fix the drops and the stupid bots"", ""Great game. Hasn't seemed like a pay to win game quite yet. But if it does....I'll probably move on to the next addiction....and then possibly change review. But till then...just pray you don't see me on the battlefield. :)"", ""An awesome game, but it seriously needs some rebalancing... When you get to the top, prepare to get stomped by the old school players.. But they're mostly nice guys who are happy to give advice on discord. No need to pay, unless you want to smash it! Definitely worth a go."", ""I was really enjoying this game! Until I ran in to warplock jezzails. This unit is so busted, it completely ruins any balance in this game. Your balance team need some time to work on some of these unit prices and power. Im taking a break from the game until a balance patch comes out. Edit: 1 star, don't waste yourtime, the matchmaking is woeful and the unit balance is insanely bad."", 'Game is good, but the comets (battle rewards) you get are absolutely bs. I beat someone with out taking any damage and get the most basic reward. Then as soon as i have no free spots to keep one its nothing but the best reward, regardless of how well or badly you win. Should be fixed to depend on how well you do, not this stupidly rigged ""random chance""', 'A reasonable experience of Warhammer, too many ""pay for options"" Far too easy to be stuck on progression mid season', 'I rarely give a review, usually it is a good review, but I found this game to have some dificculties um my opinion. The match making system is too random, you are either matched with someone of your own level ir with someone 5 levels above you, wont vê ranking up soon enough. The units are difficult to understand and you cant really get a good feel for countering other units. The spire Control getting a free unit is cool and inovating, but is rather distracting and Will spell defeat if you take.', ""TLDR: I can only speak for my biased self. Limited cards means more like chess and f2p, variety, graphics, sound. Feels like quick tactical skirmishes. TLDR more version is pretty f2p (ended up getting a season for 5 bucks cause I like this game), many deck viablities, I love Wathammer Fantasy but AOS is ok too, and for some reason I couldn't get into other clash royale-esque games but this one for me is so addictive. Sometimes I play same player with same decks two in a row and go 1 and 1."", 'Attn: Devs! ...You have to change pictures of your game,it shows absolutely nothing of the actual game!! I had to watch the video(which I never do) to realize ""THIS GAME IS BADASS""!!! I usually just look at the pics and scroll on,but only because Warhammer is notorious for badassness I actually took the time to watch the video!! I really think you guys need to out at least a couple pics of the actual game', ""I was really enjoying this. Competitive, easy to learn & time to master. Eye pleasing graphics, no need to spend money and a level playing field, until the introduction of a character that has nerfed the game. If you weren't around to play a certain pvp campaign you lucked out. Now whenever you face a player that uses this character they grow a giant mushroom that diverts your units. By the time it dies they have grown another and so on, so you can never attack anything else but mushrooms."", ""This game is 100% pay to win. It's fun but the fact that you can level up your cards with money makes it so at some point, even though the top players are bad at the game, they simply have twice as much health as you do so you get stuck at some point. Fun to play but dont pay them anything."", ""Soooo.... I really liked the new update, I had 3 stars here for a couple days! But, I have since worked out the only way to get new warlord cards seems to be buying comets. I thought perhaps warlord cards would be common rewards in the new events. That's not so. They also don't seem to be rewards from victory chests or season pass chests. Also match making, still trash. Also, fix Mannefred, that ability range is way to short for his speed."", 'Remove your stupid pay to win off your events. It is hard enough to win. Also, your events should be against AI only to allow everyone a chance to get the cards. Otherwise, you will start seeing a lot more players drop. Take an example from Warhammer combat cards. I have actually spent more there than on your game.', 'Server has too many glitches that kick me out of the game, otherwise lots of fun', 'Game is good, but at certain point you hit a wall pretty hard. Namely the match maker will put you up against people you have no chance of beating on regular basis because they out level so heavily. Makes the experience go from fun and relaxing to super frustrating especially if you get chain of opponents you have no chance against.', ""Fun concept, trash balancing and very scummy features. All this wait for the update just to get slightly better rewards but you still have to watch ads to maybe get good quests and wait 3 - 8 hours for comets. The game is no longer fun as everyone is just spamming the one broken treelord unit and you have to join in instead of being creative as these scrubs didnt design good counters to him. And the same cost counters can easily be shut down. I think I'm giving up on this and fully quitting"", ""Game itself is fun, but matchup is a nightmare, and it also let's your enemies produce at a faster charge rate when it wants you to lose.i know since I'm creating the same things at a much slower rate. Now it seems that there are others just flat out cheating, They're able to produce mana 5 x faster and just throw high ranked creatures at you at a constant rate."", 'Has potential, but matchmaking is horrible.... horrendous. The graphics are nice, the camera angle could be better and the spawn bar could be more in the middle for easier placement of the troops. I like it, but as I said, the mm makes it horrible.', ""It takes some time to figure out some combos and what unites you like to play... the events of premade decks help with learning combos too. You'll win lots and lose lots so i find it an excellent challenge. Loot boxes galore but thats the sad nature of mobile theivery. Ive gotten far by just grinding and have been playing intermitantly for over a year now."", 'Fun to play until you get to contender level and play against P2W try hards. Can be buggy and there are obvious cheaters. You get matchmade by opponents several levels higher than you and all they do is spell spam. It just stops it being fun.', ""Realm war is a great strategy game. If you're into AOS, this is an awesome mobile game choice that isn't pay to win. I'm personally new to AOS so I'm getting to experience the grand alliances and factions in a way that makes sense for a beginner. I'm wondering if my opponents are actually people though because I'm having something like a 75-85% victory rate. 🤷🏻\u200d♂️"", ""Very nice game but Treelord + Heal is hype killing... super lame; it does not feel like any strategy is involved with this combo just plain faceroll if you have these 1 lvl higher than most of yout opponent's cards. 5 stars if dumb combos like this were not in the game. Otherwise very nice!"", ""I am dissapointed again by another so called warhammer game on the store where u cant pick your hero or clan :( The game overall is just ok, im am glad we can use some skeletons and monsters, but the game doesn't keep me hooked unfortunetly its very rinse wash repeat and long wait times to open meteors"", 'This is a awesome virtual pvp table-top board program, that could be played beyond the grand master rating. I hate alot of negative comment reviews, since they are not worthy players and should not complain or play. Keep playing true pvp participants and then criticize the rest.', ""Already wrote a negative one, they took it down. Its S must pay too win after level 7, don't waste your time. Its addicting as hell, but you MUST spend money to win any matches later on. skip it"", ""I absolutly love this game! If only it had a different map and all the old units and armys though. I'd play that constantly and probably spend money on it."", ""Great game, poor matchmaking. Play games where you will win and it doesn't count towards the event... Have had multiple issues with latest update now. Please fix this or I'm going back to clash royale... Have logged faults already."", '3 minute battles are a good length. This game is like Clash Royale but better. The combat is worth a try to see if it is your thing.', ""Not balanced at all first 5 battles and I'm against people with lvl 6-8 mobs when all I have are lvl 2 and one lvl 4. Got an upgrade after the 5th battle then my next battle the player only had lvl 10s. And an absolute battery zapper."", 'Fun game. Sadly the time gating is horrendous. It takes 3 hours to open a single pack with a card and a bit of money.', ""I'm a big supporter of the Warhammer series, this game is good, but lacks depth. All fun to attack other ppl, but if you've never read, played or watched anything warhammerish, u will have no idea whats what"", 'Changing my review as my new phone runs it well. Similar in a sense to clash royal with some unique mechanics. Worth a try if you like that sort of gameplay.', ""Seems great so far. Only first day of playing. I'm hoping I dont hit a paywall. Will update in a couple days."", ""The game itself is good. But guilds are empty most of the time and can't find an active one. There's no global chat to create and guild and recruit. Please help!"", '10 minutes in hit with a glitch where you cannot press anything or do anything except close app, found forums from a year ago discussing this issue', ""Match making in this game is broken. It's even up until you pass the final level then get into battle points then you will fight people 5 times stronger than you"", 'Great game, your competition is great and the match making system works well for me.', 'Went to unlock tutorial comet game lost all ability to respond even after reopening force stopping etc. Edit ended up having to clear data and reinstall now it works decently']"

The armies are ready and waiting for your orders! 🤴
Let the battle rages on, and thanks for playing with us 😍.","['I downloaded this game thinking it was going to be like a medieval version of their WW2 games, I got this game and tried to open it and it kept crashing. I tried to open the app for 20 minutes and it would keep crashing. Please fix this as soon as you can.', ""The game is fine just like the ww2 games they made bu I have one problem why do I need to pay all of the sanarios compared to the ww2 version its free while I'm playing on one map for the rest of my entire gameplay pls at least add 2 or 3 more maps pls"", ""Very nice game but it could be better. one thing i don't like about this game is limited movements please undo this"", ""The game won't load since I closed the app. Every time I try, it just a blank white screen. While I did played it was fun (Hence why 3 stars). I have gigabites unused for my device and I can support pretty much any thing, even a million things in a app at a time. All the other games is super smooth, so as this. Please fix this so I can enjoy the game again and don't have to delete the app and re-download the game over and over again. It just isn't worth it to be honest."", 'I have a problem with the app,the frame rate when your units move is just insane', ""The gameplay is great, but it's a total bust to have to pay for all of the maps and even the ability to change the difficulty and the country your playing as. I am very disappointed with the way the game has control over you. This should be a demo for a bought game not the actual game. With dozens of downloadable content that you have to buy just if you want to experience the whole thing is very disappointing."", 'this game is misleading it says its free but its only the first 2 levels then u got to pay for it. total dissapointment apart from that it really is a great game thats why its such a let down. and team who made this you guys get paid enough from the adverts dont be greedy squeezing or conning customers if its free to play so be it but dont say its free then yank it away, thats how your brand gets a bad name sure today u make money tomorrow? wheres repeat customers?? gone to ur compettitors', 'It would have been good but it kept coming up with 980x460 resolution not supported which also means many others who use my system are also missing out on this game', 'Bought full game... played conquest campaign as England... it was fun...until you realize all you reinforcements spawn way back in England and it takes forever to get them to the front line.', 'Too simple to play, just fight fight fight with unrealistic gameplay, no fun at all.', 'nothing like the WWII version i loved. way to hard without paying loads of money for upgrades. probably wont play anymore games by them. greedy bastards.', 'Well, when attacking some of the french I found that it is not good to watch TV at the same time, either you must have the ability to see round corners or monty python will start and a silly French man will verbally abuse you', 'It does not even work for me. I start it up, then it load to the menu, then it automatically shutdown. Honestly, it looks like a good game but really, you guys need to fix this bug.', ""The Large battles don't load right, it lags Everytime troops are moved and won't stop till the movement is done"", ""I get the play style and kinda like it but TOO MANY THINGS TO PAY it's better to make the game to buy the game the in app store is just too much to pay"", ""Love the game played it on my last phone before it broke but now i try to start it and it say's the resolution 960x460 isnt supported i have an alcatel 1X go edition please fix it :/"", 'You have to make a purchase to play anything in skirmish mode, making this a pay to play. I am very disappointed in the developers.', 'this game strategy makes no sense it randomly told me battle lost even though I did not lose all my units was still on the board. I give it 0 out of 5 stars 😤', 'I think it would be a great game, BUT I CANT EVEN OPEN IT! I click on the game, a black screen comes up, then it crashes!', 'It won\'t run because the resolution isn\'t ""supported""', ""okay game. it's definitely only a demo. in app purchase a bit too pricy for what you get. No explanation on what troop trumps what? e.g. archer beats horseman?"", 'When i completed the Teaching Stuff, Something popped out and said, Start the Campaign for England? I Said No Cuz i wanted to do something else in game, THEN IT JUST MAKES ME QUIT! I CANT EVEN GO BACK TO THE GAME, This game sucks.', 'I wanted to give it NO star. I checked it right now to play and it does not open. I wanted to not give any star but i had to tap just one to write this. I am uninstalling the game.', 'It kept crashing for no reason', 'Sucks that there is only 1 map available wish the full European map was available and you did not have to buy it', ""Like the idea. But can't play because everything is behind a pay wall"", ""The game won't let me play. I can't open the app. The game keep crashing"", 'The game would never open and it was a total waste of time downloading it.', 'This game is not full free you need to buy it after few levels 😠', '1743×810 resolution problem what that even means !! how to fix it ???', 'So when i submited the termss of use it goes to black screen and it does not load', 'bots are too op they start with groups of 12 and I start with groups 2', 'poor game design with poor features & completely unbalanced, the games roots could be really fun if it was made with more care', 'could not get past loading screen, shame looked like a good game.', 'Terrible because every time i start it , it shutsdown.', 'cant even load on because it says resolution is not supported', 'App does not start on BlackBerry KeyOne. Please use detailed description including supported devices.', 'Great time killer and a nice challenge to sharpen the mind.', ""it doesn't open! it doesn't work even if i free ap space .It doesn't work still"", 'great game but i dont understand why does it keep saying i lost when I have 75% of land conquered in the crusades.....why']"

It\'s a callback to other great RTS like Tribal Wars or Ikariam. You dont wait 100+ days for a building to upgrade and the game has a small but awesome group of remaining players. There is some p2w. But, will say that a small amount of money gets you a long way. How much and how often you can cast ""spells"" to speed things up is limited. This game is very refreshing and a nice break from other pay to win games. You\'re not at a disadvantage as a f2p too', ""I've played this game on for years. I've enjoyed it most on mobile. However, despite the terms of service, the Devs have allowed the use of emulators. Now strategy is gone and you have PC based players launching 300 attacks in under 30 seconds once they map out a player and write the macro they can execute on their PC. This isnt fun... this isnt strategy... this only requires macro writing skills not game skills. I've met great people and will cherish those friendships."", ""The chat takes half of the screen and can't be minimise or hidden, graphics is extremely primitive and it loads slow on every tap. Go to the map, it loads everything one by one, takes a good 20-30 seconds to load the whole map, rebel village and player bases. Go to research screen, takes 5 seconds to load the menu."", 'I love this game, i havnt been playing to long but from what i can see, the only complaint i have is that your gov type is locked after its picked. I understand, people switching governments on the fly is no good.

I have yet to experience the PVP but I'm sure it's about as good as any other game"", ""So I'll be honest, I completely forgot about this game for years.

Ive played this for so long and been out for years and now im back. Cheers!', 'This game gives off a realism vibe that other mobile games with silly cartoonist characters just dont. It is very against typical P2W styles and feels like you can actually create an empire rather than just being a slave of a big alliance. Still have big alliances though, I would prefer if that was removed or limited to being realistic alliances such as that in pc games like Europa Universalis. Still one of my favorites for the mobile platform.', 'I had fun with this game a few years ago and am coming back to it now.

I'll be deleting the game for a while & but I may download it again in the future & the reason why I'm not staying is because it put me in a new kingdom but there were like 50 plus players already with millions of power which tells me they spent massive amounts of money or jumped kingdoms. Don't think players should be able to jump to new kingdoms. Thx"", ""I really like the game. I just wish we could have 5 days or a week shields. I keep an eye out for my castle most of the times but there's times I couldn't. I'd get attacked and lost almost all of my RRS that I worked so hard for also could you please combine 4,5 tasks in the Daily TownMode in one bigger task so instead of total you have to complete the daily tasks are 25 tasks. Combine 4,5 tasks in one bigger task so instead of 25 tasks total. We now only have to do 4,5 bigger tasks? 😊😁😅"", ""To stay in top 10% you need to spend about $1000 per month. Very bad game for F2P and grinders, you just become meat. No game balance and battle mechanics. This should have been one of the best games on mobile but the developers don't understand business and what makes players stay. Very few people play this game because of this. Great graphics and idea, stupid business knowledge"", ""The game is a very good but I will rate 1 star because, the is like every other strategy game if you don't have money to spend don't play this game but if your pocket is deep then go for it.

On older device this game will drop, heros pets battles all drop Poor connection? do not waste your time this game will not work This is a pay to play game.

I've contacted customer support, with no return email yet. That was several days ago."", 'Game crashes to much and gets black screen and have to restart everytime it happens other than that its a good game just have to restart about 50 times a day', 'Still wish the game allowed for someone to trap more than being geared solely for the attacker, however packs have come down a little and allow for small spenders to grow and feel like they are doing something more than staying under a shield 24/7.

Just wish cs knew more about game so they could answer a question with intelligence.', ""I love this game! The graphics are great. There is actually a storyline that continues as you level up. Best part though is you do not need to pay to play. Anything required for leveling up is available in game without spending a dime. If you do buy a pack they are actually worth the money spent. I stopped playing other games for this one. The dev's actually want to hear from players with suggestions and they listen when/if there is a problem. Amazing game with great developers."", 'Great so far alot better that other similar games. Lots to do and always something happening with events', 'Fun but I get glitches which causes me losses. Support team never follows through with me on issues nor reimburses me for losses. Update: Since posting a rating, I did send another message to support team. I received what appeared to be a generated message with a ""response lock"" stating that this had been handled. At the time I was still having issues and had to restart the game with a new account, setting my game play back. To Date: Glitches are fewer, the game has become much more enjoyable. So many new games that interact with the main game have been added as time passes that truly make this a wonderful experience.', 'Very unbalanced. One can never level up or be able to compete with big spender players without spending thousands of dollars. I spent about $100, and used to play every day for about 5 months to see if I can get the resources that were needed to do research or upgrade buildings, but I never got any closer to be able to compete with big spenders. The bottom line is: the lesser you spend the more vulnerable you are in the game. This game is for the rich that have thousands of dollars to waste.', ""This game had great potential, the graphics are decent and it has story modes with are nice, my true one downside to this game is the fact that you can't do a lot of things unless you join an alliance, now I know that most games have alliance's or guilds but iron throne really shoves it down your throat, this game is so bad about it that you literally can not progress unless you join a guild, you should not make it to where you made to join an alliance to progress through the game"", ""Love this game! Lots of events to do that keep you busy and you don't have to spend to advance, as long as you are diligent with events. Several daily freebies but if you are a spender, the prices are reasonable. Downside, ingame socialization needs improvement. This is an aspect that FFXV definitely wins hands down. No ingame chat rooms for friends and 1:1 chat notifications are not great. Everyone basically uses Line for chats."", 'Ive played in k25 and now k58. Though i do wish it was alittle more f2p friendly, the game allows multiple opprotunities for a f2p user to level, gain rss, and gain gear. It is FAR easier to play free than most games however and has been a favorite if mine for over 2 years. If you can spend atleast 20 or 30 a month, you may never be top 10, but you can go far. With right setup you can ""stay in the game"" so to say. Monthly pack is highly rec, aswell as certain other packs ($5 for lvl 15 gear😍).', 'Game is fun to play. Making friends from all over. You get lots of rewards, and easy to grow.', ""Don't play this game you had to start a year ago or be prepared to spend thousands of dollars to be competitive, the game play and balance are quite good but they have these awful transfer events events in which they let years old accounts move to new servers. So you can be ticking along ok you've spent a few bucks and invested a few months into the game then Bam an influx of players to a new kingdom who are 10-20x your size which makes you irrelevant. Its no longer fun you have to shield 24/7"", 'One of the better games of these types of strategy building warfare games. Really good graphics and easy to learn but challenging also.

Got to level 16 with ease, rss and speed ups, al provided by the game, lots of prizes and quests, even for low level players.

I haven't found one strategy game with the Christmas feeling!!! **"", ""It's a great game, with an amazing story and a great experience, but there has to be a balance between money spenders and non-money spenders in the game.

Use your intellect to research the strongest combinations of over 300 MYTHOLOGICAL HEROES to lead your troops, each with their own unique characteristics and abilities. Plan for a 3 MONTH CAMPAIGN as you navigate the complexities of not only managing an army, but also navigating the diplomatic pitfalls of the 9 regions and the alliances that seek to control them.

Beyond forging alliances, conquering cities, and building armies, every player competes for 1 ULTIMATE GOAL: to capture the center of the world, Delphi. It’s not about randomly killing each other, it’s about being part of something bigger and more meaningful.

KEY FEATURES:
- SUMMON mythological deities and heroes from Greek, Celtic, Egyptian and Norse mythology
- RESEARCH optimal troop combinations: 300+ Heroes, 1000+ Skills, and countless possibilities
- EXPAND your territory across a vast map consisting of over 2 million pieces of land

Welcome to a new era, where smart is the new cool. Play Immortal Conquest, a game for the mind and heart, and achieve ultimate glory through world domination. 

“Strategy without tactics is the slowest route to victory. Tactics without strategy is the noise before defeat.” –Sun Tzu, Art of War

5/5 “The game mechanics reflect how real war starts. Unlike in other games, resources are limited and expansion will create conflict. Military tactics, politics, diplomacy, you need to get everything in place to win the game. ”

5/5 “It's wonderful to find a game for my iPhone that requires a lot of strategy. You really have to plan things out ahead of time to achieve them. I haven't spent a dime on this game either. It's not one that you have to put money into it to be competitive. ”

5/5 “Thus far the game is solid, while showing face to the people and not the spenders. Strategy is evolving into a deeply competitive play. Even at the ground level if things. Worth the time to trial it out. This coming from a big spending type of player.”

The part I like best of this game is you have to actually take land to get close to anyone that may slowdown the p2w griefers. Just a tip, as a developer with a micro transaction shop it might be better to give each new player some premium currency to get a taste of the shop.', ""its mostly Free to win.... im onto my 2nd season now... loving it. its better then most of the war city management games but the 1st 8 hours are key. work hard and get into a good Alliance. like most game with people, there are good one's and bad one's.

Also they don't bother on updating the game, lots of bug and glitches on battle reports. The game is an absolute disaster."", 'Great game, it is clear however, a pay 2 win game. There is also a lack of things to do apart from the standard grinding. They need to implement other features, like arenas, dungeons and random mob monster spawns.

Apart from that, detailed and explains things well.', 'Needs some fixes and a new map. Really need to split season X up, its getting far too full.', 'Brilliant art.

Just wish I didnt have to wait so long for things. But hey. At least it isnt an ad fest.', 'This game was great when it first launched, then they introduced the option to play as a ""rogue"", which has no set boundaries. they can freely jump off any rogue tiles, rescript troops immediately, this game allows pay to play to have a massive advantage over regular players which creates a large gap between power.

Each game is 1 season long (2-3-4 months) and at the end of that season another competing server and it's thousands of players will merge with yours and repeats that. I've done it for 13 seasons and it never gets old. But the game is a bit slow paced and requires basic strategic knowledge, budgeting, patience and dedication.

A little slow collecting resources and conscripting troops. Not the typical city building/war game where you get farmed daily by the cashers.

Would like to see more flexibility with moving troops between main and sub cities.', 'Good, only issue i had was that to stay on top you put in more hours per day, would have much preferred a system that did not mean you were disadvantaged by not being as active 1 day. This is shuch a problem that i uninstalled when holidays are over because greater problems of being addicted to it than most games', 'Fantastic game to play but once basic controls are mastered the rest relies on luck. I had two accounts spent a fortune on one and nothing on the other.

It's almost to the level of esports where the same groups of 30-50 ppl set up alliances in each new server as it opens.

The only problem is the game has global servers and 99 percent of players are chinese. This game needs regional servers or a better translation system. The game has the standard click to translate, that is not good enough. This is a game based on team work. Other castle builders can get away with it because the game play is simple. This is not a click send and walk away game. This is a legit real time strategy.would be nice to be able to strategize with others.', ""I think the game is great.

Slowly but surely they tweaked the fun out of it with all the updates and added bugs. They mainly address the bugs that are hindering there profit margins like lowering fame we receive so it costs us more.

But if you're not Chinese, DON'T INSTALL the game since devs will just use you as cash cows and gonna reply to your suggestions and feedbacks with auto response like one I'm about to have. Check their official discord and you'll see what I'm talking about and why half of the players drop the game. It's like they don't care about maintaining players and just constantly creating new servers to get more money from new people"", ""Good war game. love the concept of getting the troops from building the weapons instead of training and the troops maximum amount is limited. Sadly like all war games Pay players rules and free players suffer. Cycle never ends and strong stick together and from few powerful alliance that doesn't fight each and do nothing in a war games. The worse part is the system will automatically removed your alliance without warning and there isn't any information on condition to keep the alliance."", 'Great game, pay wall is minimal.

Optimize resources
2. Fix some bugs","[""Ok, I mean it's not a bad game, but the fact that after a while, things get so hard without generals, and generals are so stupid expensive, (even the terrible ones!) that you basically have to pay to progress through the game, and this isn't even just in this game, it's in all of them, which is a pity, because this game is actually pretty fun! Oh well..."", ""Actually it isn't bad, if you played EWV, expect 1804 to be different way different. More depth has been added to the gameplay and more quality of life improvements compared to its predecessors. The only thing the game needs, maybe a game mode in which each nations starts in even footing, and alliances are made and unmade based on each faction's attitute, which should be random for each new match. Yeah, it would make each game feel different. Why can't Sardinia defeat France and conquer Russia?"", 'I found a logical fallacy in the game. The game has a system of recruiting higher level troops only in higher level cities. However, when playing as Gran Colombia in conquest 1815, I found that the Empire of Brazil, whom I was at war with, was able to recruit units of Elite Light Infantry and Musket Cavalry. According to the troop chart, these troops could only be recruited in a level 5 city. However the Empire of Brazil did not have level 5 cities. I hope this will be looked into.', ""It's really the best game if compared to turn based strategy games. The graphics, controls, ai, are better than the last one. And i have a request, can you make another set of game like a world war 1 game or the cold war and also new types of generals like a general that governs a fortress or such or a moving general that you wont attach to infantry groups......thank you for making eyrpean war 6"", 'This game is unafair your allies let you die and wont even help you. Then the devs of this game make things so pricy when its not worth it. Tbh you guys dont need to make games when you can never make the game fair and never do anything about it. Then your troops wont even do well when its against the AI which means you guys are making the AI op and the players not. Tbh you guys need to stop making games.', 'Its a good game with a number of strategic and administration control. But I wish the next sequel will be more complex to add challenge.', ""I like this game very much, enjoying playing every time. The only question is why there are no new campaigns appearing even if I already completed Roman Unification campaign? I can't move on now."", 'Battle in Russia...both armies have the same flag. Suppose to be Russia vs France. How to see who is the enemy? Plus too money driven game. No detailed instructions.', 'A fun game quickly becomes boring when you realize the AI get more money than you do. Automatically getting the advantages no matter how you play.', ""One of the worst strategic games ever because of bad allies if they want me to lose they will make me lose you don't have the decision to win or lose even if you used good strategies .world conquer3 is much better"", 'Fun game and all, but how is the enemy allowed to spawn elite light infantry within a city 2? Please fix your game.', 'Good game but a level editor would be fun and I think the Americans special unit should be planes because the frst working plane was in America. In Conquest mode I remind Russia because you have a lot of time to perp of war.', 'I love strategic, historical, knowledge or educational games,all games this is the one have gave an general information 👍,,i play easy teach game 3 years now👍,,hope its creat free games for time to time for joy in bord leaving place🙏', ""I love this series but the ai is too powerful and everything is more expensive than its worth and it makes me sad cause the concept is great but the ai is too powerful and you guys need to change that I mean when I was the Russian empire I had one czar cannon when I was Prussia they had 3 czar cannons and they made it to my units in 2 turns and when I was Britain they didn't have any units that weren't militia"", 'I love it . Its a bit challenge and demand a great strategy to win', 'So good but I wish you could add 1 enemy per game in conquest as an allie.', 'I tried ro restore my game and it brought me to the same place. Dont worry tho youll see the same purchases on refund pretty soon', 'the major problem I have is that in conquest there is next to no balance', 'To hard to win and get medals or rank up your generals. Pay to win', 'Nice game... But I hope that you will include pass and play for players', ""Definetaly the best game in the series! You can beat the whole campaign without paying a cent. It's a bit hard in the beginning but you got enough medals for good generals when you break a wall with conquests. There is also a wonderful support forum for the levels you can't beat. And the graphics are amazing! Easytech, don't stop supprorting this game. I would like to see some more content, different conquests and some new campaigns as well. Good job!"", ""This game has AMAZING graphics and general designs and generals were from different times like the revolutionary war and napolean and the civil war. This game is challenging but overtime it's fun. But I dont like how the AI can make types of OP forces in small level cities. Overall this game should a very good rating because of how hard the devs worked on this game."", 'When playing the campaign mode I found that it was only enjoyable to play for around 10 minutes before getting frustrated. Even when fighting with higher quality and a higher quantity of troops I was finding the enemy to deal consistantly more damage than my higher level troops. This got very frustrating and is the reason I gave this game 2 stars. The 2 stars is also due in part to the enemy blitzing in the beginning. Again due to the enemy being able to throw my troops and even generals aside.', ""My only problem is that in conquest I feel the economy and funds should be raised a bit as until you start taking over territories you can really only recruit maybe 1-2 units at a time depending on the country you're playing as. Building a navy is extremely rough (which is fine to be fair) but it takes up pretty much all of your funds per turn trying to build 1 ship"", ""One of the easier ET games IMO. Love how you can auto-farm medals by playing 1798 Netherlands. Conquests are very similiar but still fun to play and experiment as different countries. Campaign is difficult at some stages but with enough grinding, you'll be able to pass it. Can't wait for Crimean War though, heard it's really difficult."", 'The game really good,the graphics are for give them an oscar but the game is doing the same mestakes has the other games you made.first the allied ai is too weak the enemy generals make more damage than yours like the the troops,one example a militia of make more damage than my granadiers.Sometimes you feel that the ai is using hacks because there is no explation to this please fix.', 'The campaign is so unfair because you have to face enemies with better quality and quantity of troops and commanders. I manage to complete the American campaign but still not able to finish The French Eagle campaign because the friendly AI are useless and incompetent. For example, they failed to defeat the british fleet and supporting my invasion on the enemy. I give 2 stars because the main reasons of my defeats and failures on this game are useless and stupid allies', ""It's soo good i love it. But sometimes it's unfair, why in a lot of conquest and campaigns, example a level 2 city without any buildings can make a siege artillery on the city, not in a factory. That aslo happens in world conqueror 3."", 'This game is good and actually needs you to think and not just click(If you did not just buy all good generals of course). The general and city systems are very good and the diplomacy system is a cool addition to the game from European War 4. However, there are some problems as well, such as AI, it can be very annoying on how they spam units in a city every time you destroy them which makes it require luck to take a city. Next is the AI doing quantity over quality which can ruin the experience.', 'Very Solid, i only rated 3 stars because 1) i heckin suck 2) feels unfair but refer to 1 3) i simply dont like the upgrade system Other than that Its fabulous Not sure if i spelled that right', 'it is, as of febuary 2020, the best easy tech game of all time', 'The game is challenging, but I really like it though, I would like to ask the developers to slightly increase the amount of rewards from the conquests, due to it being the most challenging part of the game and I think the rewards are quite unsatisfying. But in other words great game Easy tech.👍😁', 'I give this game two stars because the ai in conquest mode defy the rules and train soldiers such as a grenadier or elite light infantry from a level two city, making it almost impossible to compete with the ai. Otherwise I would give this game five stars but this bug makes me want to delete it. I have now updated it to one star because of the generic response and I am seriously considering deleting this game.', 'i love european war 4 napoleon but this version is just unfair i always use encirclement strategy on european war 4 and that tactic always work or effective against troops but this version well is just failed and the AI is over power and my old tactic on european war 4 doesent works i just want you guys to fix the strategy and tactic of the game', 'The real question is what was good. Absolutely nothing complete copy and and paste from the last one and they make hell just to try and win. What a mistake', 'i think that it one star becasue the enemy have more numbers than your ally.', ""The only reason I rate it this is because i love the game but there is 1 MAJOR thing that makes me hate this game so much, so often, the fact that it automatically puts u into the wars right of the bat (in conquest), so everytime I'm a country like saxony Prussia or some random grand power kills me in 2 or 3 turns."", 'Wonderful game well put together minus a few translation problems one thing i would love to see brought to this game is the concept of getting a general that you yourself created just like the roman game gives you from the same game company that created this game', ""Fun but just few first levels. After firs few lvl it's unrealistic goals and huge amounts of gold and medals you need to upgrade your army/generals to a playable level. It's great game to begin with, but you will uninstall it pretty fast after you get stuck on lvl"", ""On conquest level two city's had elite troops popping out every turn and my generals and everything are weak compared to what they were throwing at me and I tried every way I could think to beat them but the ai acts as tho it has infinity resources and every time I took a city it would ramp up production of high tier units to the point I was overwhelmed every time I'm very disappointed in this game.""]"

Finally, you end up with mountains of forms that have to be keypunched into a database, involving time, money and errors.

Although there are 2 issues: 1. A bug on the mirage tower results in unlimited upgrades and stacks towers ontop of each other - resulting in a superpowered tower - making inferno difficulty very easy. 2. You can't predict which enemy towers will target - they don't attack the leading unit which is quite frustrating when an enemy saunters through the map without taking a hit."", ""Fantastic game. You can totally advance by playing to mine the game currency and get upgrades to beat the hard levels and unlock new maps. Well balanced, beautiful graphics and addictive for sure. I am missing the detailed zoomin to see better the characters and the towers, but that's a minor issue compared to how satisfactory the overall game play is."", 'Second time round playing this game. Pros. No annoying ads. You don\'t need to pay extra for advance stages just like ""Clash of Clan"" . It\'s been 2 months and loving every challenge. Nice graphics. One of the best TD games I have played last 5 to 7 years. Warning :- So addictive !!!!', 'Zero Star...game keep on crashing at higher levels especially at Inferno stages.

Polished graphics and good game mechanics. Wish they would make a sequel or add new levels... I've completed this one! 😎"", ""Awesome game, well developed with many levels and difficulties. Players can customize their own builds or preferred types of towers, so there are various combinations to work with. The best thing is you can buy the whole game by in-game currency if u are patient enough. Also, little to no ads. I'll definitely support this developer with other games and willing to pay if it's as awesome as this."", 'one of the few. and by that i mean. No commercials, no energy, and no pay to win. you can buy little ghosts yo upgrade but you can farm them just as easily. it just depends how much time you want to invest and it is not really that much time. I love this game for what it is and that it does not feel like a money hoarding game.', ""Overall, it's decent, but this is not the type of game that one wants to grind in........ And this is a VERY grindy game.. needs more.. the options for towers are VERY limited and it gets old quick.... Support is only available through the play store, so there is no real way to include game data or request support for glitches... Don't download for something to do in your spare time.. this is a game for when you have an hour or two yo waste"", ""I would like to say, it's for me the BEST game on the store…. Why? Because game play is very good, graphics are beautiful, musics are nice… all to make a Best of… we can see the quality of developers… they are great… And one things IMPORTANT … You are not oblige to spend any bucks to play or upgrade troops to finish the game… Ok, ok, all is not perfect. One point negative is about money gestion… many times i have tons of money and all my towers are already to the maximum upgrade.  Keep fit"", 'Despite good Game quality and concept I have to rate it the least because there is no back up support from the team if the player has to format / change its device even after paying for some levels and that too after signing through Google play. Crashes are always there repeatedly. Keeps on Crashing especially in Wastelands on summoning MacHellman. . Kindly improve if you guys want to stay in coming years.', ""A pretty good game, but you only have three different stages with five levels each. After that, its going to cost money to play the next three stages. For this reason I'll only give it three stars... one for each stage."", 'Great graphics and animations. Fairly horrendous gameplay. Starts off great, becomes fairly unenjoyable quickly. You basically need to replay every level to get all stars, or spend a bunch of money to get through it.', ""I was afraid it's going to be pay to proceed game. But once you understand the levels you can beat them all. At least now, while I am half way through a game. Game looks good and is fun so far."", 'Perfect game. But it was too easy to pass the game, and no awards in the end.', 'the music is excellent, game play challenging but not off putting , good graphical , no sluggish or over reacting poor algorythmn , game play proportional which is good , disparant proportional I find ruins possibility of accurate strategising , which is not the case here.', 'Graphics are smooth and the gameplay is balanced and excellent but having hero units for support wuold be a big plus plus.', 'The game is cute, nicely animated and is generally worth a try. However, a few things hold it back from greatness. The AI tower settings are *terrible*. Your archer units will go for melee. Your foot soldiers will just stand there under ranged attacks and die. Arrow towers will switch to ground troups without finishing that nearly dead flying unit. The opening cinematic is very loud and refuses to respect in-game volume settings, which can be a problem if you want to play it quietly.', 'Great game. Excellent graphics. I wish if there will be part 2. What needs to be fixed is the achievement monitoring board. I think there are some bugs.', ""it's the best td game i ever played even the market with time u can get what u want music is awesome surely i gonna support the developer only thing is with google play and facebook implementation sign in issue at start hope u can fix that progress not saved if changed device thx"", ""Probably the best TD game I've played. A few small issues include: character dialogue gets old really fast and there's a steep learning curve figuring out the correct tower combinations. You also can't get all of the achievements for some reason. However gameplay is challenging and is a lot of fun. It took me awhile but I was able to beat all levels and max out the star rewards. Now I'm just trying to get all achievements but as I said bugs are preventing me from doing so."", ""The game has so much potential. Superb graphics, funny dialogue, lots of towers to choose from. The only thing making it unplayable is money. You will need money in order to properly play, otherwise you would have to grind extremely hard ,with insanely difficult levels which can't be crossed untill you do some good amount of upgrades."", 'you need to make more levels. or perhaps a second because this is the only game ive actually ever finished. this game is litterally by far tje best game on this google play store by far. why u dont have 50 million downloads is beyond me. everything about this game is awesome. the graphics, the strategy, the storyline, the way the units walk (lol) the only thing i would like to see is perhaps more towers or more variations. but sometimes simple makes games better.', ""Game looked decent. However it bugs out on me after a few rounds, screen goes all glitchy and units go invisible or have big flashing blocks around them. 3rd Scenario crashes my tablet completely after a few waves everytime I try it. Unplayable games get 0 stars but I can't go below 1. To those that can play on their devices, hopefully it stays functional for you"", ""Great game and keeps you busy for quite some time. Challenging enough and most maps can be beat with various combinations. You only get 3 levels to start, but the rest are easily unlocked either by accumulation of souls or by paying a few bucks. the rewind feature is a great idea and i wished more games had it. You don't have to restart from scratch if you get a bad spawn or weren't paying attention. Generous with souls, so you can easily farm to unlock and max everything."", 'Graphics are good although the user-interface could do with more polishing. Some buttons get off the edge of the screen, making them impossible to tap. A bigger problem is the gameplay, which is too boring and bland. It brings nothing new to the TD genre. Also , pay-to-win after four stages.', ""Avoid this game. It's too buggy. There are random crashes and there are levels that always, always crash. Rockaway-Inferno: Unfinishable from crashing Wastelands-Hell: Unfinishable from crashing Gawd-dammit it is infuriating. If I can't beat the level, I can't advance. What the hell am I even playing the game for? **FIX THIS CRASHING PROBLEM** I actually paid to unlock the levels before I realized how bad it was. I feel so ripped off, now. I'll avoid any games from this maker in the future."", ""Game is cool but it's disappointing you have to pay to play more than the first three stages. And yes, you can technically earn Souls to unlock stages but you also need souls for upgrades in order to beat stages so it's kinda a moot point. Wish there was a premium version you could buy where the whole game was unlocked but sadly seems like this studio is just as toxic as so many others with their burdensome pay to play/win strategy. Best of luck with that."", 'Good game but keeps booting me off right near the end of the level. Which is very frustrating...', 'No progress save possible. Wasting time when switching phone or reset. On top of that, this game asks for location, very useful for a game 🤔', 'Fun simple tower defence, everything can be obtained via an easily obtained in game currency but without grinding you will find yourself walled off quite quickly as the free portion of the game is only a few levels. A fun game regardless just be aware of an early grind or a small seemingly reasonable paywall.', ""Horrible grinding away for hours for almost no money. creeps aren't worth anything for as much effort you have to put into micro management. I mean this could be a decent game. But nope. I spent a few bucks,before I realized that upgrading towers also drops the creeps monetary value... This game actually pisses me off."", 'Good TD game. Good graphic with good sfx. The only minus points of the game are just it cannot be zoomed and doesnt prevent phone from sleeping. Overall its a good TD game, worth to download and plays it over and over go reach 3 stars on each level.', ""Very fun game. Great for passing the time. The graphics are great and the gameplay is well designed. I really like that they make the game difficult enough that you can't breeze right through while also simple enough to not destroy your hope of winning."", 'I have enjoyed the game itself but the low rating is that after the first 3 battlefields, it iis 8,000 souls each or $1.99 per new chapter! If you buy the package it is $7.99 to play the game which is not okay!! And saving up 8,000 souls when every upgrade to your cards also costs souls is IMPOSSIBLE. It is a $2 game at best!', 'Great game. Not so easy to play and vreeze through hence more challenge to the seasoned TD gamers.', 'Graphic is good and easy to play. As usual u ned to pay to upgrade ur weapon if not u will be stuck on early stage']"

EW5 should be a model for your future projects (ever thought about a scifi theme?) That being said, you guys do need to polish the game a little bit more and add some quality of life improvements. Conquest mode was my favorite, but it did take me a while to really sink into it. The diplomatic aspect of the game needs to be fleshed out more. But overall great job!!!', 'The best strategy game I ever played brilliant job keep doing it, and I hope for an update some things to add and something to change for example it will be great that we could build 8 troops in every city in conquest mode make an option to upgrade your old troops and... why not ! you can go with troops upgrade more further something like robotics other than that is all great I love it', 'This game is good. But,not with AI,in empire mode. I have see there is so many stupid move in empire mode,when do battle... and i cant control the battle. Even i have power stronger than enemies. Still i always defeated,because stupid AI...', ""Really fun, enjoyable game. I like how it's offline so I can play it wherever. The campaign is good and it links with the conquest and empire game modes as well."", ""This game is super hard that what I love about it. This game make you think about your next move and trust me one wrong move and it could cost you the war. People say it a pay to advance game but I don't believe so. You just have to train you're troops give them good equipment I'm in age 3 and I can tell you I did not pay for anything and I'm moving along in the game just find. But it super hard just the way I like it."", ""well this game is great love the strategical game play you can't make one wrong move or its all over, thats what i will about this i also like thw fact you get some of the finest generals around and conquest mode is so good, i also like the campaign really good and strategical as well same with Empire mode. but the problem is tryna get literature thay stuff is really hard to get plus i don't want to pay for it, I'm in Empire age ready to move on but I can't considering i a lot of literature"", ""A great strategy game with lots of heroes to collect. I like having to rank heroes up. I just wish medals were easier to get. I enjoy the difficulty of the game but the AI that plays for you in Empire auto battles is just terrible most of the time because it often throws your heroes to get flanked or attack a target that counters the hero. Again this is all random but what are the odds though. .maybe I'm just unlucky all the time in the game. The AI is only thing I would change about the game."", ""Probably my top favorite amongst the European war series in terms of gameplay, especially on the conquer world and campaign. Giving it 3 stars because i am royally pissed at the auto battle maps on the Empires. The AIs are so stupid. Doesnt even protect the archers or seiges, dosent even put the general's skills to its fullest potential. Should atleast put an option on auto play, or just scrap the whole concept, or improve the AI. There is no strategy, and so stupid to just watch a simulation..."", 'A really good game The cartoonish graphics is a really well thought out idea. But my problem is, later on it becomes really impossible to pass a level without purchaing (with real money) a strong general.', ""I totally love this game but it reaches a level that you need to pay some money to get the 3 special generals that's kind of annoying to be honest and the literature is so hard to be gained .If the generals can be gained much more easier the game will be perfect."", 'Love the game, I hope there will be new version where its like total war mini game version.', 'Love the heroes!!!Dislike,despise,and abhor everything else!!!Edit:my heroes are in Age III,still with bows & arrows & catapults while the rivals & invaders are sporting rifles & cannons & are at least 10 levels above mine!!!Is this what the devs call fairness???Another major reason to despise the gameplay!!!', ""I can't stop playing. Good strategy game ever. But so expensive to upgrade to next age."", 'Alright, this game is not the worst game that is ever made. Its cartooney graphics is a new idea, interesting but not so appealing to many EasyTech fans. It requires some grinding and for a good while you can win without paying. Towards the end it will get much more difficult, but at least the Comquest mode is fun. Not a bad work, still thinks others in the series are better though.', 'I very much enjoy the easytech series of games. I really enjoy this game as it is a lot of fun, especially the conquest modes. The main criticism i have is the AI in Empire mode is awful. Struggle to win battles and invasions due to my units attacking randomly. Especially when calvary attack archers knowing that archers are good against them. Its so frustrating watching my best units die due to attacking the wrong enemy type. Please fix this as i am rated 33 with my generals but loose to 26.', 'What a great game ... The only problem of this game is saving ur progress in google play game .... But still super addicting hehehe', 'I hate this game because the movements of the soldiers are super slow and the game is taking too long!!!😠😠😠', 'Beautiful conquest but the campaign is so hard in my opinion', 'Best game they ever made the conquest is really fun but the campaign is hard. Also i got to the end of the game and over the 2 years pur a lot of money into the game and i switched phone and emailed them about it but ive heard nothing on how to get my progress or money to use on the game', ""went too far from the franchise's roots the conquest mode is too complicated, why i can only move my army on restricted line instead i can move around like Rome 2 Total War? and why theres a end turn option during a battle? why just real time? why is this looks like a Turn Based Stragety? although the campaign is fine, progression system is fine also made the game addicting but I didnt like that much because the reasons i said"", 'Great game, but you should add a sandbox mode. That would make the game a million times better.', ""Honestly, the game is great. But you need to work on conquest because this type of conquest is pretty hard to play and I would prefer if you can add more troops to your own side. Your country doesn't have a lot of money or soldiers and it's more of pay to win."", ""Great game.but can I get back the things I paid for once lost or is it gone forever :( didn't save in cloud."", 'A fun conquest game where you can travel trough time line. But some timeline are unaccurate such as discovery age where spain own Portugal and MOST flags are wrong Germany never existed in napoleon era and the Canadian flag was wrong even though it in the files and italy was never its own country all ways bening own by Austria or holy roman empire and ALL the country leaders are unaccurate or dead for centuries. But it still is the most fun game from easytech', 'Fun ...good offline play...if it was not a pay to play the rest of the game past level 11', ""IT'S A [money] TRAAAP!! COULD be a great turn based strategy game if it wasn't designed to be impossible without having to throw money at it. You'll enjoy this to start with, then you'll learn to hate it. Be warned 👍 Enjoy 👍"", ""Great tactical game that is free and not overly complicated. It's hard to find a strategy game that is free of ads and still has good gameplay. 5 stars for the content and price with NO ADS."", ""It's an ok game but I suggest not getting it because I bought one of the generals from the store and went to get him back but nothing happened and then I emailed them and they have not responded if getting this game you do have to buy some medals but if anything happens to your phone and you lose all your generals you can't get them back"", 'It is a very good game.

Up until the 3rd era, where you REALLY have to pay to advance (which is why I only rate 4 stars) I still play even after a year, the cartoony ARTSTYLE is what got me into the game, other than a good RTS Hopefully EW6 is better', 'The invasion thing is trash like let me do it cuz your ai cant do a damn thing im a level 13 and my best generals (better then the enemys) cant beat them because of the fact that the ai for my team cant do a damn thing', 'the animetion is good but the strategy suck. where you just have legendary generals and legendary weapon then boom ez win and its just a big pay to win game. the medals are hard to earn and if you clear the empire map you cant earn medals anymore wich is if you dont buy medals you cant clear the game', ""the game works perfectly with eras but, in med-ages/medevil can you change the banner of China (flags where not created yet) China's history xia,zhuo,shang,qin,han,jin and so on. and remove huns in the middle ages huns have already gone by then but still in the classical age keep huns. can make In middle-ages cardif,wales and Ireland it's sef and belfest"", ""Good game but you need to pay money later in the the game because it's to hard"", 'Good game but crashes a lot much better then 6', 'I like the game but AI that is supposed to help you in campaign is so stupid it makes those missions sometimes impossible. on top of that no ability to reset spend points makes your early mistakes really count', ""Hey I love this game I bought all three of your generals and it's a lot of fun. but if I could request one thing it would be that you make this game cloud based and open a Bluetooth multiplayer option."", ""It's really good but always always rome or china are the greatest I understand because they are big and whatever but it's hard to make them weak because the attacks are hard you can make it better come one think because this is the best game please make it better""]"
