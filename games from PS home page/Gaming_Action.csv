You might expect to get a better experience after getting premium. But what do you get after signing up for premium? An option to sign up for premium plus! Ridiculous! Uninstalling after the free trial ends.', ""This game is awesome! Ive been wanting this game for years and i finally got it! I always used to see the ads but I don't need ads if I can actually play it! Thank you so much for making this game! It's kinda like fortnite and I've always wanted to play a sniper game! Thank you Thank you Thank you! For making it free! I love it bye! Oh and btw this game deserves 5 stars!"", 'Really Disappointing, I have been playing this game for few weeks. At the start it was really cool highly addictive. How ever over the last few days the game has become irriting. In particular the PvsP arena well playing connection just cuts off, I used to really enjoy this game I hope the developers fix this problem quickly. And before you guys say check my internet my line speed runs at 1 gig per sec.', 'Game is fun, well done but, epect to pay. Seems everytime you max out your weapon you will need a upgrade soon and this means you need to buy a new gun, then upgrade it for for unrealistic amounts of coins or diamonds. I made it to level 12, cost me 400 bucks. If you want to play this game then dont buy everything they show you. Use what you have until it needs to be upgraded, if you buy, get diamonds because they are a must have. Upper upgrades are on the low end 150k coins, yes 150 thousand.', ""It seemed good. Its decent, but buyer beware. If you purchase your piggy bank in the hope of upgrading your arsenal... after you make it to the next tier... suddenly you dont have enough... my diamonds 1300 of them just vanished. Poof.. gone. And wouldn't you know it... I no longer have enough to upgrade my weapon. Seriously, and theres no way to contact support to find out what happened. But hey, I can spend more money to get better weapons No happy at all"", 'Sniper 3d is so fun. I wish I could play more sniper 3d. the perfect game. however, I dont really like how the sniper shoots people. maybe have him shoot ducks. also, maybe less shooting. I didnt download this game to see people die. just have them walking around while you look at them through binoculars like me and my neighbors. they all live such menial lives. to see the human in their natural habitat assuming they are free from my watchful eyes.', ""Overall, the game play and the concept is great. However, this game has one major flaw. In PVP mode, this game will often loop you in a pvp map with a lot of players that are ranked a lot higher than you and have much greater gear ratings than you. There are weight classes in combat sports for a reason and this game's algorithm apparently does not take into account players' gear ratings and ranks, which begs the question of why they even exist."", ""Good but full of ad delays. Play for about 20seconds. Then if you have failed the mission, have to watch a 1 minute video or vame advertisement. Price to go premium?? Which I hope would mean no ads, is $60!!! That's insane for something I'm just goofing around with while waiting for the dentist. If I could pay a few bucks for a paid ad free version it would have been a good game"", 'Nice game to play . It just not long lasting I ended all the cities and no more missions to do. You have to expend $$$ if you want a decent gun. I got to the last sniper and assault rifles and after all the upgrades still inadequate. The PVP keeps letting players with high gear and weapons come and annihilate the poor ones. How do they get all those goodies do they spend their salary on this game.. for the prices of the weapons you buy real ones at the store and.go shoot at the range cheaper', 'Everything is good UNTIL you get into the PVP arena. For some FU#&ED up reason they will have players that are FAR above the level that you are, and you can literally not get off a shot. You get killed 5-6 or 7 times during the course of the 2 minute game while they are racking up 12 and 15 kills in a room that only has 8 players. IT IS INFURIATING!!!!! IF you download this game then STAY OUT of the PVP area until the programmers can get their collective heads out of their asses and fix this with bracketed arenas!!!', 'It\'s an... ""ok"" game. But, there are too many people cheating in the pvp. Powerful players intentionally lose to drop down levels and the developers don\'t do anything to address it. In addition, there are way too many ads. It\'s to the point of you\'re spending more time dealing with ads than playing the actual game.', ""It was enjoying in the beginning when I first downloaded it, then it would continuely push you to buy into the game which was nomal at first but then it became overkill and if you didn't give in, it would start messing with your games. It made it impossible to move forward in the game. Then each game was flooded with commercials, then it forced you to update, after the update it change the way your energies were and the game became impossible to control on your phone you could not aim at all."", ""Too too many ads...then you are seriously pressured into paying for premium. The way they do this is you must upgrade in order to accomplish levels. I'm at level 7 and they have drained every resource I had. Diamonds and coins. Now they exhaust my energy in order to get more money. REAL SHAME. IF YOU WANT TO SPEND MONEY, GOOD GAME. IF YOU WANT TO SPEND HOURS JUMPING THROUGH THEIR HOOPS, GO FOR IT. NOT ME!!!!!"", 'Don\'t download. Can not progress unless you pay money. Steals your diamonds because it acts as if you\'ve ""won"" a piggybank, your diamonds get taken and put into said piggy bank. Want to spend those earned diamonds? Pay E 3,19! Weird way of forcing you to spend money. Want to upgrade weapons? Sure! We just make sure the next mission has needed items you can only get by spending money. Watch 100 ads ~ money to them ofc. But it\'s still not enough because they want you transferring money too.', 'This game used to be fun. But the developers letting cheat codes and hacks continue has gotten old. But, I\'m sure they made money off the back end of the cheats so don\'t really care. Time to uninstall and move along. Besides, they\'ve been so busy with their new tank game that they haven\'t updated the next city yet. It\'s been ""Coming Soon"" for over 6 months now.', ""Superb Game play and Graphics. The Levels gets harder and you have 2 online option to score Gold, Diamond and Battle Coins. Only thing is that, don't buy anything, it's just a Honey trap and you will find you are the same position even after putting Real Money. Also they will provide you discounts only when you don't have enough Diamonds. Once you have purchased them, viola forget about discounts. This is so stupid."", ""It's too difficult to earn the coins or diamonds unless you are willing to pay for them. It's not fun to get put into a PvP arena and get taken out 5 or 6 times and not be able to even get a shot off. If it were a little easier to upgrade weapons AND gear, it would be more competitive and fun to play. I'll spend most of my time else where. Upgrade it to make it more fair and fun and I'll recommend it to friends and family to play as well."", ""You can't enjoy this game with a lot of players with mod version, I paid around 40 USD to get better features and weapons but still it's nothing at all against players with gears of 53200 and special sniper with damage of 10K, And you can't get this sniper because it require to finish the arena challenge which doesn't exist in our version !!! Please stop all players whose haven't sign in by google or facebook account and stop all moded versions of this game. Keep updating the original version!"", 'Its Exciting and I love it . BUT I dont like the limited conversion methods they force you to pay for when upgrading ... its very F****ing rude and it detours us to keep playing it. There should be missions that accrue war coins as well as diamonds not only money. You will continue to get BAD REVIEWS IF YOU DO NOT CHANGE THIS RUDE PROCESS. FEELS LIKE VIRTUAL EXTORTION. if one likes your game they cannot continue unless they pay hard earned money to do so. VERY INTENSE IN A NEGATIVE WAY.', ""This game gets ridiculously hard the higher levels you go because everything is about money. You have to pay to really advance or get ingame upgrades. I do enjoy the game and its graphics but I refuse to pay. I am well skilled with the mediocre equipment. The author of the game knows little about firearms and sniping. I'm rating higher than I should because of graphics. Ads are incredibly frequent and annoying."", 'Unless you are willing to pay ridiculous amounts for upgrades you are just target practice for those that do. Missions are all basically the same and there is obvious cheating occurring. How can someone get 15+ kills in a 2 minute game where supposedly no one ""knows"" your location unless there\'s something shady going on? Do not download. Not worth the time. And really not worth the money!!!', ""The game is amazing, but I would've given it the 5 stars if not for the cheap move with the piggy-bank and that you have to be premium to open it, and thus, pay for it. Also the diamonds are stored in the piggy bank instead of my personal stash, which is such a bad move. Please work on these problems"", ""I liked this game at first. But there is an ad between every kill. Then you have to buy diamonds or upgrade to get better weapons. By my fifth kill I was sick of waiting for the ad to be done. I don't recommend unless you plan on spending bookoobucks to play. SUCKS!!!!!!"", 'Ads, ads, ads. Ads after every event, and sometimes 2 or three in a row. Game play events might be 10 seconds for an event then watch 30 to 60 seconds of ads. Plus you have to watch more ads to get coins and diamonds to get necessary upgrades. Fun game, but ads ads ads.', 'The ""offers"" are always put above the amount of money you have and I have never been able to use those offers. The ""free trial"" for premium doesn\'t work and it\'s full of ads. The gems/diamonds I get somehow disappear after a while too.', ""ADS ADS ADS!!! BUY THIS!!! LOOKIT THIS GAME!!! can't play more than one shot without something you have to do, or some popup you can't dismiss. Could be a cool game IF you didn't have to buy every... Single... Thing. I'm not sure if it was fun... To much else going on with the popups and ads....."", ""The game is cool but when you don't wanna update your game is still makes you And you get to the hard level where you get to the shoot in the guy is the they don't like help you anymore is hoarder every level you step up so that's So that is why it is a 4 star from me and also our love to give the game file stars if it didn't make me update the game when I didn't want To."", ""The only problem that I'm experiencing is adverts after each and every online mission and it takes much data. Especially those adverts that doesn't offer rewards. Please do something about it. But otherwise, I really enjoy each and every moment I spend on the game."", ""Really enjoyed this game , has lots of different scenes to partake in , however it comes to a point where you need to spend cash to move forward ......... As silly as the more expensive the weapon is , the more missions u unlock.......then yet again you need to purchase a more suitable weapon ......the coins or tokens you win can only get you to a point......... All in all it's another way to rob people for money........UNINSTALLED"", 'This is a nice game and I love it but they force u to see ads and spend money on buying new gun and... That is not good.☹️ But okay still I am playing this game.🙂 One more thing when the pigi bank comes most of our diamonds are wasted😕 they tell us to break the pigi bank with our own money.😔', 'Was good up until I see you have to buy jewels to excel in the game. Level 10 and I have to put cash and lots of it if I want to gain any futher. So as much as I like it (deleting) I cant pay to play that much money.', ""I would rate this 4.5 if I could, but I can't. Great game, but can you make the opening the piggy bank part free? Because it's really annoying how I get 150 gems in there and I have to pay to get them. If you can change that though, that'd be great! Apart from that, the game's completely fine. Edit:Woah! You're from Ireland? I'm in England!"", ""It's not a bad game but dont bother doing pvp it's nothing but cheating the pvp is sniper rifle but I see players using full auto rapid fire like minigun steams of bullets kill you before you respawning have low gear rate health but are bullet proof like they have 100,000 gear rating cant kill them so just do normal missions you're better off the other problem is now you have to wait until they make more missions after you get to last mission it says coming soon maxed weapons sit and wait"", ""Annoying Game, Very good but it won't let you play for more than a mnt before it shows Ads , I think the price to upgrade a weapon is too much. It is a very annoying,and they annoy you with adds on purpose so you make the purchase."", ""It's super fun, but it's a bit too easy sometimes. So I'm Hoping it will get more challenging. It's offline also! No internet needed to play. Unless want to buy a pack or ammo or guns with real money. In other words... it's great!"", ""What the hell did you guys do to the update, the game now lags in pvp like it's abit slow and distorted, my phone's ram is 4gb so I really confused on what could be wrong.

It's abit frustrating please fix it."", ""Basically a pay to play game unless your willing to spend A Lot of money you won't get anywhere in this game.

New added contents are also fun! I hope some gliches when playing in multiplayer mode can be fixed. Our weapons multiplied when picking up another weapon, then picking up the weapon earlier, as well as some items drops. Hoped for that to be fixed. But, I really recommend this game!', 'I played this game for 3 years just about, and I still play it today. Very Enter the Gungeon-y game style, and amazing weapon variety. Great game overall. Although, I think that disabling autofire would make for more challenging gameplay. And it should also be on PC. Just some advice, bringing it to PC would improve marketing, so please consider it. Thank you!', 'This is a nice mix between RPG and bullet hell genre, I also like the retro art style. My only complains are that a lot of nice characters are locked behind a paywall, and there are only 3 main dungeon levels that you go through in order to Finnish a run, there are however around 7 variations of dungeons. I would like to see more added to the game.', ""Exelent experoence, i've played for almost 4 years now and I can say it has improved enormiously, great soundtrack (never boring), great gameplay, better with friends, etc... I would love if they added leveling, so you can level your account by playing, and also level the characters by using them, and then that gives you benefits, but the game is 10/10 for me, not very realistic opinion but the best game ever played on mobile"", 'This game is incredible. But, I am mainly writing this review to provide critical feedback. Asking people to pay for characters, and not even just a single character but many, is somewhat ridiculous. While i love the game, i would like to be able to play as all the characters without dropping over ten dollars. I would ask the devs to make characters available for in-game currency, as the developers already receive profit from donations, purchase of in-game currency, and purchase of garden plots', ""Soul Knight is a great rogue-like, dungeon based RPG with lots of features and items. I'd recommend this to alot of people and my friends because it's just a great game. But the thing is that the gameplay gets old from time to time but at least you can get other characters, try experimenting, and lots of achievements and challenges you can try. And updates! I played this game since 2017 and it's just great. absolutely great. a few bugs and exploits need to be fixed and just a great community."", 'A pretty good game with great controls and lots of content. The makers of the game are pretty consistent with updating the game and keeping the game fresh.

I should have played this earlier. Unlike those overrated, shallow, asset-flipping money-grab which only exists to make easy $ like Archero & clones, I can feel that devs worked on this game with genuine passion.

Idk if this is even a bad thing just makes the game less simply good. Also, one MAJOR problem is that in wave mode randomly you will lose progress and if you're on wave 100+ and you want to take a break, you lose ALL of your rewards and 500 gems you spent to play it"", ""Soul Knight,an absolutely amazing dugeon crawler there is never a dull moment with randomly generated everything and challenges to spice things up you can craft and grow weapons and at least 3 bosses you can get one of in each level and playing with your friends makes it even better but don't take my word for it try it yourself."", 'I would give it 5 stars but everytime me and my friend try to play multiplayer, even though we are on the same wifi, it does not work.

The pixel art style is something I've always loved, the fluid controls, how easy it is to pick up, IT'S FREE, the fact that it's multiplayer, how smooth it is, everything.

If this game had servers so I could play with distant friends, I'd be ALL over it!"", 'The game is great, really fun, although some characters i have to buy with money, but there fairly low so it didnt disturb me, but could it be possible if you guys could make the local multuplayer less laggy there are momments where the game kicks me out, also one last thing, it would really make my day if you guyd could make online multiplayer, that woukd be the best thing ever. Besides that i dint see much of any bad things besides lag in local multiplayer great game keep it up 👍', ""I've been playing sense beta and still most played game on my phone you guys last big update with the armour suits and I suggested it you guys did it and added a few extra extras to boot I got a tiny add on of being able to craft weapon upgrades as well as weapons ex: lava stone. Thanks again you guys are awesome keep up the amazing work."", ""it was great until the last update. i always play multiplayer with my brother and we have lots of fun. but after the last update we couldn't play multiplayer even once! please fix this problem. even though we're using the same wifi we can never play multiplayer."", ""I'm always a big fan of pixelated games. Pixelated games just give out so much color and are so vibrant, its satisfying to play with, especially when the game is a dungeon crawler. Another thing is that i love randomized generation. We may rely on luck but it's still extremely fun cause you don't know what's ahead of you and it's always a mystery. Soul Knight has got to be one of the best mobile games. But i wish there was online multiplayer not just local, so we can have fun with others online."", ""Great game. I love that there are so many weapons there are swords, guns, axes , speaes, bows, and hammers. I only wish that you could leave the game more than once.

Whenever I go to the forge table i look at the Gold Laser Sword and it says i already forged it(which i did) but when my game crashed after i forged it, it restarted my game and the game had shown me that i never had the gold sword. I even went to the basement where all the trophies are and checked and it still says i dont have the golden laser sword even though the game tells me I unlocked it in the forge. Please fix this. Thx', 'One of the best mobile games out there, I just wish you could earn all characters through in game currency, also a online co-op. Edit: after playing more of the local co-op, it can get very laggy depending on the amount of projectiles on screen.', 'This game is amazing! I liked the fact that the devs mixed cute characters with monsters to fight, as it is quite fun! There are barely any ads (only to get a better weapon before a run or to get gems). The only problem I have is that I would like more ways to get gems. Overall, I would recommend this to people who like pixelated fighting rpgs.', ""Great time killing. Very fun. I love that we can enter into random world and fight different monsters. It would be better if you can add an option to let us choose which world we like to go. Oh, the option is only available for normal. Badass isn't available to choose because it's badass. Thank you."", 'So...The game is amazing, has amazing graphics a great Gameplay and good controls that could improve a bit,along with an optimization in camera drive especially in multiplayer that happens to be a lot of fun but could be even better as the buffs being by vote and the loot being equal to all players the camera is the main problem I see in the game if it were centered on the player would be much better. Also the horde mode could have a multiplayer option. And get all characters with game currency.', ""So this game is actually pretty good. If you're looking for an offline game that's fun, with ads that are OPTIONAL (you can revive once with ads) then definitely get this game. However, my only complaint is that you can't unlock all the characters, as some cost real money to unlock. The characters you can unlock for free are all powerful and fun to play with though, so I guess it doesn't matter. (if you want to try all the characters, unlimoted gems, etc, look up a hacked mod apk)"", 'its really fun to play with friends using LAN party we have fun and bad times while playing it,but still the game is pretty great,very great job,dev team Edit:Can you guys fix the LAN multiplayer connections? 2nd Edit: I really hope that the LAN connectivity strength can be enhanced in the next update.', ""Great game, wish it was longer. If you're a fan of games like Binding of Isaac then this is something similar in its rogue-type like dungeon gameplay. I play almost every day because I enjoy the daily challenges. It could do with correcting some of the descriptions of the some of the buffs. Some of the characters I found kind of useless, even though theyre expensive to buy with in-game money or real money, but luckily my fav is the first one you're given anyway. (MAKE THE GAME LONGER 👍👍)"", ""Love this game. The only game I've kept on my phone long term. Lots of unlockable content with varying difficulty, as well as opportunities for earning gems. The game is as hard or easy as you make it, and it's possible to play without spending anything or watching ads. The biggest plus is my husband and I can play over local hotspot/wifi during plane trips and during long waits."", ""Oh! This new update was fantastic! I've been expecting a little more of the story and a new chanllenge. Weapons and boss, nice. New skins, great. But, I got a little problem. Sometimes, the game gets so, so much lag, making even impossible to move, or fight, especially in the new mode. I am very satisfied with this update. The work was great. And, I know it's not easy fix some bugs in the game, but, I hope you can fix the game to be more fluid and fix the lag. The rest, was a great work"", ""This game has an unusually brutal difficulty at times, but it is well worth it. I love the design of the characters and environment, and the number of unique weapons is amazing. The challenge of winning the game makes you work hard to improve your skills, and the different heroes allow for many potential playstyles. It has its glitches, but those that there are aren't gamebreaking, so it is an otherwise very stable game."", ""I have been playing this game for 2 y. already. The gameplay is fun, the charachters are different the enemies even more. I enjoy the bullet-hell that the game sometimes puts you through. The adds are all optional(second chance, more gems, better weapon in the beginning). Only the half of the characters can be purchased for in game currency, but it is a great deal(you don't get all the characters for free and at the same time you don't get the annoying adds). The game is totally worth your money""]"

Keep an eye on your character’s life stats such as hunger and thirst, collect valuable resources for crafting, create weapons and transport of different types or use what you have at hand: a bat or a road sign. Everything will come in handy for killing dozens... hundreds…thousands of zombies!

Defeat intruders to your land not only with your power but also cunning – construct fortifications with traps or go raid other survivors’ territories for the sake of rare loot and resources. After all people can do anything to survive. 

Hardcore fans will have plenty to do in tough seasonal locations.

Few days back everything was fine but it gets worse starting today. Please fix this cause i really love this game\'s concept.', 'I just installed before 2 weeks ago. The game is simply awesome. Such a great design, players can be motivated to achieve more things and levels. Not boring actually. Fentastic game I ever seen. In the perspective of a gamer, No time will be wasted in this game.

It was a great effert from your side. Thank you guys', ""As I progress further in the game, I can see what the critical reviews are saying. You lose stuff, despite watching ads for energy, you can't go back to reclaim. Turret becomes completely impossible to cross, No rewards in bunker after killing very high level zombies.

Pathetic, initially I thought you guys really based this game on strategy but it's just another profit machine"", 'It is a nice survival game, I play it for hours. But, I have some suggestions. There should be a infections because you get spit at by toxic and in a few seconds, your fine. Why not add infections to be aware of and medicine to cure it. Also, you get hit by zombies and horrible creatures all the time and not even a germ.', 'A really fun game. The only issue I have is, that dying in zones like pine woods, or other instantly resetting zones is deleting all your stuff. I would enjoy it if zones that normally reset instantly would reset in a couple of minutes, so you can get your stuff back. Maybe something like: Green zones:2 minutes Yellow zones:4 minutes Red zones:8 minutes (After you leave the zone) But only in instantly resetting locations.

We play for hours and spend money, make us want to keep funding you guys.', ""I love this game, I play it everyday and have played for over a year. I gave 3 stars because I'm pretty much stuck in the game. I cant get the chopper gas tank and cannot progress until then. I have made the trip to bunker alpha countless times hoping to get it. It's just not happening. You should make these type things a little easier to obtain. Playing for over a year to find yourself stuck is disheartening. If these rare items were a little easier to obtain, I would give the game 10 stars."", ""I love this game it is very addictive but I dislike that when you breed for a new puppy both parents run away.

Trouble is it takes forever to advance in the game without spending money, and even if you do spend money, it\'s short lived. All your equipment eventually fails, wears out, or breaks.

Loved playing but I have to delete this one and find something else.', 'Love this game. Respectable graphics and enjoyable premise for the game. That being said certain aspects do need a little tweaking. The energy aspect of the game make sense but the energy regen rate is far too slow 10 mins for 2 energy isnt a very good trade. Also after completing the resources at your base spending upwards of 10 mins just to reach the nearest resource spot isnt very fun and i know energy can be used to fast track things but at its regen rate its best saved for emergencies.', 'Honestly an incredible game. but the body recovery system seriously needs reworking. You should be able to find multiple of your own bodies, or at the very least, if you die the first time, go back to get your stuff, and die a second time without picking anything at all up beforehand, you should not lose everything in your first body.

It starts out with a minimal amount out coins after that you either wait the day to recharge or you can pay for it. There's no way to earn free coins. Essentially, it's a setup to spend real money on fake food. Idk why it's so expensive. Just wait the day people.

Imagine doing this every time you want to play or more frustrating, every time to enter a zone or return home. It is very, very,very frustrating.

The graphics are fine and appealing, especially the skins and event maps. The heroes are fine as well. Some are a bit unbalanced but soon readjusted. The gameplay experience is good too. Except the matchmaking. I recommend having matches with adjacent ranks (e.g. GMs with Masters, GMs, and Epics only). That applies to all game modes. Overall, it's a decent game for everyone. Only problem is the discipline of the players."", 'Good. A nice and easy version of League of Legends, basically. However, I feel like the violation-reporting is very easy to misuse. For example, tonight I had a bad game and people reported me, even I was using a new hero and was experiencing lag. Kind of bollocks when you have a bad game and get a violation and penalty, just for testing out a new hero.', 'Unfair match-ups and unbalanced heroes. When I play on any mode I always get matched with people who are ranked higher than my team. The heroes are so unbalanced. Whenever I play the enemy team always has so much exp that within the first five minutes of the game, they are already 2 levels ahead of us and maybe 3 levels. And also, this is a pay to win game: the skins have attributes, you level up ur emblems with MONEY. How about the players who have pure skill? These last updates were horrible.', ""The game itself is very good and one of the best or maybe the best moba out there so far but the downside of this game is the community, like there is alot of people trolling to make the team lose and they've never punished, maybe they have punished but still can play this game...like I've experienced just now, my team literally say that he is gonna be trolling us. So that's the very bad side of this game, the gaming community..."", 'So I have played this for years. (Before they even called it ""Bang Bang"") and very slowly it has turned into something ugly. There are lots of problems with the app, I still play it, but the reason I will uninstall is because if you have a mildly poor game they will ban you from all matchmaking for 5+ minutes while toxic kids from all over the world will rage on the chat towards you without repercussion.

It would be even better experience for gamers if the characters would have more skills than standard 3 The only problem with it is the unfair system that alway penalizes even those who have played well or playing the character for the first time or the game itself.

If you're disconnected, you will be deducted 5x the amount of credits most players will earn per day.

I suggest waiting for Riot to release the mobile version of the real thing."", ""Best mobile game. You don't have to pay to play or win. But I wish more free stuff were offered.

They will rig games and make you loose its beyond infuriating be fully warned it isnt paranoia or post game rage.

Seriously annoying."", ""I enjoy playing this game, but it is seriously flawed. Events frequently disappear, leaving you unable to complete quests. The game constantly freezes during gameplay, and that further hampers your ability to complete quests.

None of this would bother me if I didn't have to pay for some of the features."", ""I would rate this a five star if it wasn't so expensive to obtain upgrades and the screen going black and you lose what you were going for.

The only way to win is by getting specific abilities, and upgrades to your hero, the difficulty curve isn't balanced in the way where you have to grind for 7 days endlessly to get the gold or equipment, or as they present, pay money to win ane upgrade yourself. There aren't any ways around if you wish to be free to play."", ""Love the game. Just what's funny is that I completed 50 stages offline and I unlocked the next world, then when I played online and I had to re-do all the stages. But I dont really care because that makes the game longer and more fun. A suggestion is that devil offers should actually be permanent or should be a bit longer that one game. Other than that, this game is the best ongoing offline battle game I have ever played. Thanks for making such an awesome game."", ""Too many ads. I generally only play paid games to avoid ads. In this game, even if you spend $100 or more, you'll still be spending a good chunk of time sitting through ads. This is an otherwise good game, and I have no regrets for the money I've spent in it, but I can't handle the ads anymore. I'm going back to other games where I can pay to opt out of ads. Edit: heard there was an update. It has even more ads lol"", 'It used to be a smooth gameplay without any lag. Nowadays, my game keeps lagging and even shut down a few times midgame. Fix this please. It was a fun game while it lasted. The upgrading has also become really slow. The chance to get more points for upgrading equipment has definitely dropped after the new update. Extremely hard for free to play players to upgrade at an acceptable speed.', ""First, this game is super fun. I've spent hours playing this. If you played binding of isacc, you'll love this game. I also just want to say, out of all the game ads I see on Snapchat, this has been the only one to do ingame ads the right way. Ads should be opt in by the player, and not shown after you die. Thank you for doing this!"", ""The game has a really nice gameplay. I've been playing for 8 months but giving up now. It's just pissing me of the lack of value it has. To upgrade your gear to the highest level you need to invest hundreds of $$. This is crazy!!! A premium top rated ps4 game is 60$. Guys, with the amount of money that you need to invest to have max gear in this game., you could literally buy a ps4, a mobile phone, a ps4 game and play on your mobile via remote play. And you wonder why people hack this game :)"", ""First of all, I downloaded this game after seeing an ad for it only to discover the gameplay in the ad was nowhere to be found. Despite that, it's a pretty fun game to pick up and pay for a couple minutes at a time. Unfortunately, it's mired by a strange ad system that either doesn't work or freezes and makes you lose progress. Would have been a 5 star game without the false advertising and buggy ad system."", ""Pros : Fantastically addictive app! Great game play with heaps of enemy types and lots of weapons and armor too! You really feel powerful when you kick the ass of the big bosses and that makes you want to play more! Cons : It would have been 5 stars but you do get error messages quite often. Connection errors are annoying. I've spent coins on upgrades and they haven't worked which is frustrating. Fix the errors, get 5 stars all day. Thank you."", ""You really need to make something with the attack, instead of attacking the mobs next to me, it 's attacking the one that remain far, but the one that move next to me fast doesnt attack. I have to move and then attacks the one next to me. It s really really annoying. And the bosses when they hit you deals different damage, is a bug too i think, because i had the same stats and equipment. I hope you solve this problems fast."", ""I just started playing this game more often now and it's kind of upset me. Next to only have 20 energy, (4 games), I feel like the grind feels like a hassle because even the most common of gear rarely drop, taking weeks to upgrade it and progress so you can finally finish that level that's been so difficult to beat. I feel as someone who stupidly has put about 40$ into the game, I should have infinite energy to use so I can properly progress. It's a super fun game btw."", ""The game was fun, graphics are nice and the mechanics are simple. The problem is; The game was a good challenge, but now, they've released so many 'bad' skills and upped the difficulty of the game, that it becomes a frustrating experience. I've been playing for about 10 months and the last update killed it for me. You might enjoy it for a bit, but that's it. Don't waste time / money"", 'fantastic game. it is fun and all. but energy system sucks. if you dont have energy you have to wait ( about an hour) to play again. give players more time to play without paying for more energy. i hope developer wont limit the energy that we can get from ads. after energy is depleted its ok for me f i have to watch an add for 5 energy ( without limit).', 'Not the game promised but a happy alternative. I actually really enjoy this game. The game play is quick and fast paced with what seems to be a pretty easy leveling up system at the moment. It forces you to wait until certain levels giving plenty of time to save. I will say however.. I clicked this via one of their adverts in which to play the game you created the map guiding the monsters. Not running around shooting them. False advertising but great game none the less', 'The game is really fun and I enjoy it a lot. However, the monetization is down right atrocious. You have your standard Gems like most phone games, which is fine I suppose, and they even have ""sales"" almost every day it seems. Where I have a problem is the cost of the characters. You get 2 for free, but then you have to buy the rest. $18 for one character?! No thanks. However, I haven\'t felt that I need to buy anything. So that\'s a plus. If the characters weren\'t so expensive, 5/5.', 'Really enjoyed playing this game for a long time. It falls off once you get to the later levels. I hate that you have to pick one of the random generated items that you get as you level up in the castles. Especially when they keep offering the worst items available. This game is fun for a while but really gets you frustrated in the higher levels.', 'Hi guys! Thank you for creating such an entertained, creative and fun mobile game like this. The best part is that it can even be played offline and anywhere, but I think it would be so awesome if you guys could also add online mode as well, such as PvP or 2v2 or even Co-op, fighting with your friends. I hope that there will be more and more NEW Modes, Equipments, Maps, Modes, Boss and Monsters and variety of SKILL POWERS in the game, maybe even new characters. Thank you and keep it up!', ""A simple game to pick up with depth, longevity and a high difficulty ceiling. The range of equipment and abilities in conjunction with the in-game level-up system really makes this game shine. I particularly love/hate the double-edged nature of certain upgrades. The combination of enemy projectiles and your own creates a disorienting bullet-hell scenario, adding a subtle layer of difficulty that commands respect. I'm conscious of the addictive features... Yet here I still am."", ""This is a very fun game (sometimes rage-inducing) in general! I love how simple the mechanics works and how smooth gameplay is. Plus it's not a pay-to-win kind of game so it's really enjoyable. I kinda wish I could save my progress and back it up as well though. I had to re-install on another device bc the previous one I was using is gone so I have to restart all the progress I've made from world 1-8 :("", 'This is such an amazing game! I love everything that this app has to offer but I have a slight problem with something which is the control of the character because sometimes he acts on his own and goes in the direction that you were pointing at even tho you lifted your finger off the trigger. Fix that and i will give you 5 stars for sure!!', 'I really enjoyed this game but now it is plain ruined with these new ""power-ups"" that you don\'t want and the ones that you really want (like diagonal arrows, multishot and wall bounce, bolt) rarely ever are offered. FIX YOUR GAME! I won\'t be wasting anymore time dying and watching ads until you make those specific power-ups more frequent. It is not fun to play anymore.', ""I love this game! I have a couple suggestions though: Could you put a feature to compare different items without taking into account its level? If I have a lv 15 weapon and I have another one but it's not upgraded yet I have no idea if it's better to dismantle the one I already have or not and It is automatically destroyed if I try it so It's difficult for me to compare stats. It would be cool if you could upgrade the sound on this game because I feel like it's OK but it could be better."", 'At the beginning the game was great. I was giving a 4/5 stars.. Now the game getting worst. It was my favorite game on my cellphone. But now the game is getting garbage. NEW SKILLS are very lame and worst . Instead getting new s**t skills, improve performance on characters , more new characters or pets . STOP doing new skills, your making the game worsted.', ""This game *was* good... Then the difficulty ramping got out control. Devs constantly adding useless abilities just simply lowers the chance of getting 1 of 3 abilities needed to win. The entire game becomes stagnant around stage 10 or so. Seriously, unbeatable bosses and enemies spawning on top on you. It's painfully obvious that you can't even pay to win this game if you wanted. *Update* Devs say go farm for equipment... not when I've been playing for 5 months. It was fun while it lasted."", ""The game is fun but too many skill are useless. It's worth it to consider modifying either the damage output or at least the range of the sword skills and orb skills. If not it would be better to remove them all together as they just take away from possibly getting a useful skill. Make some fixes and this is easily a 5 star game."", 'Overall a really good game. Please fix the hitbox of some monsters. You should as well include a bestiary with tge monsters we encounter. it would be useful to know their powers and abilities. Another thing that i would like to see is my attack and attack speed while playing and how it increases through power ups Updade: this game is now full with useless skills. They increased unnecessarily the damage of the events. Each creature dealing almost 75% of your hp.', 'I\'m really enjoying the game, it\'s challenging yet alot of fun and I can play for hours when I get into it. I\'m having an issue now where I can\'t watch ads when there\'s prompts to do so. It says ""ad not ready yet"" , it\'s getting very frustrating! I\'m finding it to affect the gameplay as I feel like I\'m missing out on opportunities to help me progress. I will gladly change my rating to 5 stars if this is fixed.', ""Please add a skill page, so we could learn what does skills do to the hero. We have to try the new skills to know the exact effect that it makes, and it would be so much better if there is a skill explanation page. Also, there are some skills that I don't want to use at all, it would be so much better if we could exclude some skills. But overall this is a very good game."", ""The game's good and interesting, grindy and satisfactory, however there's couple of completely retarded mechanics: 1. RNG of skills sometimes it gives you 2 or 3 of the same skill, so not much of a choice. 2. Enemy targeting - from what I see it works on the closest enemy only, sometimes I maybe wanna target enemies that are not behind walls. 3. RNG of levels makes most of the time usage of skills like attack speed plus completely useless bcs u get cucked in a corner. 4. There's a max-cap stats."", ""Game is designed to make you either empty your wallet or waste your time. I've have a good experience with the game except for the fact that three of my weekly purple chests just didnt give me anything and instead made me watch an ad. Otherwise, this game is quality compared to the other games offered on the play store."", ""I like this game, I'm level 52 and I'm on 10 Land of Doom and it is very hard to pass from here because when you have lots of mobs appearing from everywhere the character you play, shoot everywhere and I don't have time to react. I gave only 4 STARS because they should update the pointing targets by manually because it the only things that this game needed in order to be playable to be perfect. P. S. - I will keep leaving feedbacks till they will change the way it targets. Thanks."", 'Gameplay is rewarding and fun. I dont really like how there are loot chests and you have to watch ads but the gameplay makes up for that. The energy is kinda annoying when you are playing on a day to day basis. It is a great game that I think you would enjoy if you like the binding of isaac and other rouglikes.', ""Dont normally rate games but this is just too good. The ads dont did it justice. Ads are non intrusive, so far plenty of powerups and when I die it's from my inability to dodge attacks not the game trying to force you into micro transactions. It is a fair and balanced game with the normal moble game traps but perfectly playable and tons of fun. I sent it to everyone I know it's that good."", ""Concept is good. Low rating because this game literally punishes you for being good at it. The skill curve is insane. The amount of time it takes to build up equipment is rediculous. The new skills they try and implement are garbage, because they dont actually do anything, OR are so stupid it doesnt make sense. It's a punishment to get them to begin with. Then they punish you while you're playing for getting them."", ""Lots of fun right out the gate, but goes downhill fast. I'm all for hard levels and grinding, grinding because I don't want to pay, but weeks of grinding for minimal progress just isn't wort it. If it's not meant to be free, rather charge upfront. I think an opportunity missed. Edit 02/17/2020 I've installed the game again and after playing for a while. Big improvements all round. Levels feel more balanced and much smoother controls. More loot also which makes the grind worth it. Well done."", ""Fun game but you need to watch ads and sync to thier server doesn't sound too bad but for whatever reason it can't do it over wifi the ads are eating my data. :( Hopefully they can fix it. Update has a thing popping up every minute to ask you to watch an ads for in game stuff if you (you could watch it every hour or every 72 hours and it give you the same overall why does it pop every minute when ready then?) Very annoying let me click it if I want the reward."", ""Been playing this outstanding game for the pass few months, but iv recently have found a few bugs that are starting to get annoying. Recently iv tried to open the game only for it to crash. Another problem is the gameplay stability. Idk what happened recently but its so glitchy that I accidentally upgraded a common bird ring when I was trying to switch tabs bc it was glitched. If the devs could look into this, I'd b more than happy to give a 5 star re-review."", ""I really love this game. The graphics are nice and it doesn't get boring. However: it's really annoying that sometimes the game just crashes in the middle of fighting. The progress I've made is gone, as well as all the coins, weapons, scrolls and sapphires I've already earned in that round. It's especially annoying when it happens in something like the spring festival (it did) because even though the progress is gone it did save my run as an attempt and I can't try again without buying."", 'Was 4 star. Then gorilla made it 1 star. Newest update is 0 stars. The pay to win was bad, but they added ways to make it possible to play without paying. Recently added some really bad upgrades, which nerf the customization& power level of the gear. Now the grind is slower &more incremental. The pay to win is stronger because the per try upgrades are weaker. Before you could get lucky on roulette every few runs now the roulette is bad so slow upgrades are the only option.', ""Still the same complaints. You'll get stuck on certain dungeons (7, 8, 10, 11, 13 if I remember correctly) for months, unless you pay to get better equipment because the enemies are seriously overpowered and the game throws a ton of cheap bullshi* at you. You'll start a level and immediately have walls of projectiles and melee enemies inches away, making it impossible to move without getting hit. I can deal with challenging. I can't stand dying because of cheap shots."", ""Amazing game! For the sake of improvement, few ideas/constructive criticism : -An option to skip the one by one item leveling up. -Boomerang bug fix, they disappear when too close to walls. -Shouldn't be two of the same ability on one roll of the ability choice. (and no penetration ability for the boomerang) -Stat upgrade in percent so it stays worth it -A cool mode that combines the 4 elements on elemental abilities (eg : 4 swords at once)""]"

I look forward to the growth of this game and more animals and special abilities."", ""I enjoy the game, the graphics are good, and it has a lot of details/different parts that are engaging, despite being very simple. The one thing I don't like, is it's kind of pay to win. Many people will pay to have their characters and perks high leveled, which makes them OP to the point where it isn't enjoyable. I wish certain levels were grouped together, so instead of 16 vs 9s, obviously imbalanced, you have 9s vs 9 vs, battles where your skills are tested, and you dont die immediately."", ""Match making needs improvement. The players should be gathered in a separate waiting cue before being placed in the map that they are gonna be playing in.

Crashing constantly after months of play and uneven match ups. How is a player suppose to have a chance against someone 5+ levels above them. They base their match up off trophies not character level which makes no since, since trophies off no power. Makes you not want to play.

I found the systematic progression very good. some people might not like the difficult pace but I really loved it. it was well worth the grinding. there are some secrets which you have to find for yourself though. all in all extremely fine game. really hyped for the new updates!!"", ""Fun game but you'll want to play through and get the hang of it the first time and then restart over probably. You're going to want to try to hit the warehouse before level 20 consistently to start getting the equipment for your bicycle. This game is pretty in-depth features for a phone game. Even though I am not much for paying for things on phone games I've even caught myself purchasing on here just to support the Developers. I would strongly recommend watching walk-throughs on the warehouse"", ""I've been looking for this kind of survival game for the longest time. Just started playing and I'm hooked. This would mean, hours of nonstop gaming. Just hoping I dont ran out of water and energy. Haha. I still gave it a 5star for being a wonderful game. But for other players who will play this game in the future for them to give the same rating you should improve the inventory slot."", 'I really like the content of the game, but you have limited stamina and the game uses it for everything. Basically you are severly limited in everything you can do to force you to progress slow. By slow i mean simple tasks like gathering enough wood to fuel all your production and cooking and building means repeated trips to the grove to get wood, but you only get 2 stacks, which burns all your stamina and you need to go find something else to do for an hour or so while it recharges.', ""UPDATE- add some voice overs to all the letters and things you find, will make it much more enjoyable! But still, a great game. By far the most enjoyable mobile survival game I've played!! So much to do, and even more to loot. The enemies are gorgeous, terrifying and fun. The graphics are beautiful. The story you play through is actually interesting and the characters are intriguing. Would be great to see more things to build and craft in the future, but so far very well done 5***** 🤗"", 'Great game. Long, slow grinding unless you pay. Been playing for a few months now, decent progress. One of my favorites though, I play every day. Events let you earn good stuff at all levels to help you regardless of progress. Would give 5 stars, but it tends to lock up frequently which is annoying. Thankful the load times are not painful so that helps. Keep up the great work guys! This one rocks! 🤘', ""Graphic and the way you collect raw items was nice. The bad side of this game, you need lots of money to go to next level. Why money? I tell you why.. 1) the durability of your bought items will decayed with damage or killing zombies, so you will always need to buy new Equipments and weapons from the Mall(real money used here). 2) In your hunting maps, there will be maps that will eat your all your Equipments and weapons. You may die inside that map when you'r unlucky..( i lost my Legendary..)"", ""Wonderful! Absolutely wonderful! So easy to play, so easy to beat! Oh, and challenging! Wanna know how easy? Well, for just a few easy payments of your hard earned cash, an arm, a leg, or maybe your soul, you can get all the gear you'll need...for about 5 minutes or so; until it breaks or you die. Like challenges? Great! Try this game where you can experience the joys of having your ass repeatedly handed to you as the game becomes increasingly one-sided, every time you gain a level."", ""Graphics and storyline are top notch, variation of enemies from cannibals, wolves to zombies. Lots to appreciate. Besides the small pouch that has very limited space at the start and energy depletion after farming at 1 place is too quick. There's not a lot of complaints. I wouldn't play the game too long unless you bought gear with real money."", ""Blacks out when I enter basement. This game is awesome though. And I was really happy when I found it. But I cant progress anymore, not being able to enter the basement. I have enough ram, space etc, so it's not that. It's only done it for basement. The screen goes dark and there is nothing. There is still sounds and the monster even killed me while I was in there."", ""but Much better then most games if the type... but still a few bugs issues balance is better then tou'd rhink at first (you get stronger and get better loot and quests and rewards as you level..) other then that.. fairly fine.. Looking to see more content that'll be nice.. and a insentive to pay for... Since right now paying simply gives you such things as armor and beats the game... so clearlly yet in beta...(feels that way at least..)"", 'My experience has been good. This game is fun but its very difficult to move forward. The experience levels rise too quickly and opens items that are unable to be crafted. The weapons and tools break too quickly and the enemies are too strong. The hits are always different. So this problem is making the game kind of boring and repetative. Im gonna hang in there and see if I will ever make it to the warehouse.', ""I love this game hands down already. I played last day on earth forever and the game just was slow dragging in development and I never felt any real purpose and it didnt feel like they cared about their fans or fan base but right from the start you can tell this game had a goal and wanted to please there fans great game let's of fun and different things in here thank you for creating this !"", ""First survivor game I've played. Like the concept but spend way to much time trying to keep up with weapons food and cloths. I get it but having to build new weapons every time you go out is dumb. Cloths last a 2 or 3 hours of play time, dumb. It takes a lot of your resources to keep up with these so you don't have much inventory to collect other things you need to move on. Wolfs coming out of no where to attack you while in a building is also dumb."", 'Very good game, but there are anoying parts to it. Tagger respawns far too quickly. Wolves are a pain in the rear end. And respawns too quickly. Constantly being asked to rate a game you have given 5 stars to is annoying. Using more energy when in the shelter than outside is plain wrong. Not pausing the game whilst browsing storage is odd. I think food and water is used more at this time? Over all though it is a 5 star game. Good graphics and storyline. And no one raiding me yet.', ""After playing on a couple days, it is hard to play all missions, the dev always give an option to buy an equipments. Once you bought it and you die, all your equipment lost even in the event mission if you go back to your shelter first. I went back to shelter is just to re-equip my character and fall back to the location I die, but when I go to the world map, that event mission is gone. And the dev offers you to buy again. I'm tired and I'm uninstall it."", ""Just outstanding gaming innovation. Very complex and you have to approach it in a strategic manner. Everything is affected depending on how you want to tackle the challenges. Smooth gameplay and can be rewarding with abit of patience. Although go and explore unprepared and you will pay the price. It's far from perfect but its a very good attempt. Specially with the other competition out there. It's definitely up there as one of the best for it's genre."", 'Thanks for discord link, i got it working!! Amazing! Will update as i explore more of the game! I did and ....its perfect! Story is great and the game is play to win! Have not seen a game like this in so very long and that is What makes ot Unique! Support is great and so is the community i cannot wait for the future of this awe inspiring adventure!', ""This game can be so frustrating but it's also incredibly well made. You really need to strategize and hoard to get anywhere. My only suggestions; It'd be nice to find a gun or ammo every now and again. Would be amazing if we could have pets like dogs and horses! Maybe tame a wolf. When putting things from my pockets into storage boxes it'd be great for there to be another button that transfers only what is already in the box."", ""First I rate this with 5 stars. This the first game that I'm spending money for. I'm disappointed. I went in the warehouse for the first time and the boss attacked me right after I've opened the fist door (with claw next to him). I've managed to kill him but after 5 sec he was summoned back again. I've watched so many videos and in none of them the doors after (the blue ones) warrent open. And the boss is not coming right after the entrance. I'm out of supplies. DELETE."", ""Best mobile survival game I've played. A balance game even though I haven't spent money for it yet. Good sound, good graphic. But still, the attack range is the most annoying, prevent the game to be better, hope you will fix it. Plus, i wish you'll develop the multiplayer function or create more diversifies strategies in the side-quests. Thanks for your hard work until now, still one of a best survival game, 5 star absolutely <3"", ""Like most of these stamina goes away way to fast. Your drink and water supply drains to fast and of course the materials needed to make anything is to small. I understand the need to make it difficult since it is a survival game. Also the use of stamina is an old tactic to get people to not play without paying so that could be changed. Other games have done away with the stamina thing so im not buying the whole can't be taken away."", 'FIRST: I want to see the movie based on this game! BUT: Beta/buggy. Game crashes, and it gets worse the higher the level for some reason. Have to keep restarting the game. Game balance is ridiculous regarding weapons and armor, repair, etc... Give us our empty canteens back!!! Make it more accessible to repair and UPGRADE our weapons and armor, using our resources. Rare tool kits is ridiculous! Game is conceptually awesome! Graphics very detailed. ART! Hope devs keep fixing!', ""Hands down the best survival game I have played. Game is easy to learn and as close to free to play as these types of games can be. Spending only required to make things easier, but definitely not needed. I contacted support and although they responded very quickly, it seemed that didn't want to check the logs and fix the issue"", 'Awesome survival game. Even though its flatout the exact as its competition. I prefer the graphics and controls much better here. the only thing missing is a companion. Where is my puppy/wolf/ dog/bird/cat ? No companion no 5 star rating. No cash from me. Going back to the competition until a companion is added', ""Bit hooked on this game. Although, may be better if weapons were a slight bit easier to come by as getting killed is tough to avoid and if I want to get further in the game, that needs to be the thing. Going stealth doesnt hide me at all and trying to beat the zombies is hard if I can't do damage when I'm close to an item. Also, trees, concrete, berries etc should regenerate at shelter."", 'tedious game, finding what you need to upgrade takes for ever, lower levels are easy but the next levels are almost impossible, many levels up and still can only make first tier weapons and armor, and I have issues with the energy level, You use it to often and spend a lot of time waiting for it to recharge', 'I really am addicted to this game...however....watching videos for rewards and ""triad keys"" comes with a 50 percent chance that the video doesn\'t finish and im disconnected from the game.

Sometimes the game just doesn\'t respond and once again the game stops ...kicks me off...etc. please fix this!!!', ""Updating my review and deleting this game. Storm fall is a survival game like this. Same design but a mid evil feel. That game, your character does not go hungry or thirsty while just standing or moving around for less than a minute. Fix the hunger meter in this game. It's too fast. I used to like this game but it's very unforgiving, weapons break easily, and the hunger/ thirsty meter runs out too quickly. I gave it 2 stars for graphics. That's about the only cool thing about this game."", ""Good game.. but some necessary fixes and balances required. Understand its survival gam3 and its challenging but the boss hp going back to full health while exiting zone for self healing makes annoying and extra hard. Please kindly make that the boss's hp dsnt refill. 5 stars for that balance.. rest gameplay everything is Good as ever. Thankyou for the help. Much Appreciated"", ""This is a nice game but after few minutes of playing it lags a lot . It lags so much that i have to switch off the game and please for God sake keep this game simple. After a player dies please don't vanish it's loot because it's not a real life it's a game. So please keep it as a game . It's my humble request . Please fix these two things"", 'Graphics are wonderful and the controls are simple and easy to learn. The walk through is pretty basic but the storyline is awesome. I like the characters and the ability to get everything you need to craft and build although it isnt too easy. Its enough to keep you entertained and to keep you coming back each day as there are great daily rewards that you can use right away. The packs are decently priced though I havent made any purchases. Still new to this type of game but I enjoy it.', 'So far i think its a very nice game. I just started so im very new to it and im getting to learn the mechanics which right now seem a little bit much but it is well put together. This could be a console game. Imma keep at it because it has pulled me in to see what more it has to offer.', 'This game fresh asf, honestly I played alot of survival games like ""Last Day On Earth"" and I loved it it WAS fun but it got really boring fast. This game has a lot more going on , an interesting storyline, amazing weapon display etc,0 but the best thing of all I don\'t have to go in my backpack to switch my weapon!U can switch weapon\'s at the heat of the moment, AND switch bandages to throwing items instantly! And it\'s barley for months in and already has so much more then other survival games!', ""When I first installed this game, I quit playing after an hour. I was frustrated about the constantly drinking and eating so I gave it one star and uninstalled. I gave it another chance because I liked the gameplay and story but was still frustrated about said complaint but slowly kept at. The devs were right when they replied to my previous comment that if I give it time everything will come together smoothly. The more I invest time into this game the better this game gets. Don't rush it."", ""I can't even begin to go into detail here about how awesome this game is. If you're a fan of the survival genres this is literally perfect for you. Mainly because everything that you can buy in the game, you can literally get in the game. Don't die in the same place twice. I made that mistake and lost a lot of good loot. I bought. Thankfully after contacting the developers. I received that stuff back. This game has has an awesome future and I can't wait to see what they do next."", 'I got addicted, quick. It\'s fun. Couple drawbacks for ftp. Important things are hard to acquire, the daily quests get monotonous with less important rewards the higher your level.

Spend hours just to make a weapon and lose it all just to have to redo it all over .."", ""Love this game but I dont see the resources I need unless it's in a terroir that I cant go in bc my weapons are too weak. I spent money to get good guns but lost them bc I went somewhere I didnt know I would be killed and I lost everything when I went back to get my things I died again and went back and all my things i paid for the first time was gone and the things I had the second time was there.... like really. Idk everything else is great but be nice not to lose things I paid for."", 'Good game, good graphic, and share inventory in safe house. The cons are: - use too many resource for upgrade/build (made to do framfreek) - use too many resource for repair/maintain item (must un equip good wep/armour eyery time or going nake to do farming) - extreem repititive farming in same location(green location) for basic resoucre like wood/scrap - red zone/event is armour/wep check (made to framing) Summary for my opinion: game is not hard nor challenge, but it lean to heavily farming.']"

It still has never fixed most of the real problems, waaaaay too many ads, (that's because they just use it to make money) also this game is an accurate representation of the rich vs the poor, when you're small you can try to get big but there's no real way to get big without the Giants eating you, only if they help you get big, but they never do."", 'Great game, but it needs some ballanceing changes. I have played this game for a longtime, and I love it. The problem I have is that when you spawn in, you have a good chance of immediately being eaten by a big cell. This makes the game almost impossible to play when you first start out. In my opinion, this game should adopt s system similar to the new florr.io, where after you are a certain score you have to move to a more challenging part of the map. This way small cells can grow easier.', 'I remember playing this years ago. I loved being able to cruise around, get bigger, and gobble up the occasional competitor. Now it\'s a frustrating unenjoyable teamster fest. I saw someone say the average player last 20 seconds to one minute. My last two rounds I lasted 9s and 20s. The game can get laggy. This can lead to even earlier death. The ""burst"" level kept showing waiting players go up and down, but often would never start an actual game. Insufferable. Hats off to old agar.io. RIP', ""This game is really fun, but when you would play the game normally you would get killed by teamers. It's a fun game not gonna lie but the playerbase isn't that good. Teaming is a problem for me. When i would reach number 1 people would team up on me and keep trying to kill me. I don't know why they team. I can get to #1 without having a partner to help me. Again, it's fun though."", ""It's fine but when I played it the first time it was great then someone killed me, so I started over and it was glitching so 😧😔😫 that when I tried the 3rd time I barely couldn't move and when I did someone would pop out of no where or a glitch would happen and i'd die right away. Nice game but fix that lil problem. (Tʖ̯T)"", ""I had great fun playing this while I was in school, and still do! But the amount of ads alone is turning me away, also the money that you can't earn but have to buy is a big turn off, I wanna make my own skin but can't because of it. All in all, a rather mediocre experience."", 'Good game, kind of laggy and you should be able to spawn away from a whole ton of players because I keep getting spawn killed. but I love the fact you can get skins and make your own characters and usernames. Going with other reviews, I think it would be a good idea to have an online or against AI mode.', ""This game is really frustrating but so much fun, I love it!! Would it be possible for you to slightly increase your starting size when you go up a level? If that was the case I'd be completely addicted. I know that you increase in size when your bubbles slowly go up one point at a time to a specific point ie 20, 50. Unfortunately only 1 of your collection usually goes up so it takes forever, so annoying!! This is the 1 issue with the game but it's a big 1 I'm afraid so had to remove 2 stars."", ""This makes absolutely no sense: there isn't even a tutorial. I have no clue how to split, and I have no clue what the 'rush' game mode even is. The mobile controls are also very bad.

I want there to be a tutorial so some people actually know how to play and I want the controls fixed."", ""It's an awesome game really, I would love to give u a 5 star.

Anyone can make it go that fast if they sonic threw the button."", ""Honestly it's garbage. Filled with ads, game glitches out from time to time, and overall the players are just toxic.

It would be better if there was no teaming."", ""It was horrible because on this game 1 problem is you need to spend like 99$ for only a thousands of these kind of things you can spend stuff on.

I feel like PCs should be on a completely different platform and not play on the same app as hand-held devices. That way the competition is fair."", ""What happened to getting coins from every match? When did they switch to the whole potion bs? One year later edit: This has gone downhill even further in the past year. It's clean interface from the past is gone. It's added both ads and a vip system. The only thing that it has kept from the good ole days is the name. Even the gameplay is slightly off now with the jerky movements."", 'I like the game but I think the macro should be faster and there should also be some kind of offline or sandbox mode where you can play freely by yourself.

The game devs should at least step up and stop people from using assists and cheats.

Its not that hard"", ""Can you give me a break and let me play the game for 30 seconds without hitting me in the face with ads and microtransaction deals? If you don't manage to survive too long, its an awful experience with all the ads. The game is the same as the web version, but controls on small devices is weird and there is an obvious input delay. New players should have immunity to getting eaten until you move because of the delay until you can actually do anything once you get into a game."", ""I only rated it 1 star because you can't rate it 0 star. It doesn't even work. You move it forward and it just stays there for 20 seconds till it constantly moves, doesn't and can't change any direction and then you get killed by a ball. You can't even start the game for you start it, your ball freezes and another ball kills you. That's how bad this game is. You can't even find where the country flag balls are.

There needs to be some kind of delay for at least 10 seconds when you first spawn.

I'm usually not that big. Me as 1 has got me big. I'm glad I found this game! Before I found this game I was bored. But, I also LOVE the game Horse Riding Tales.

I wish everyone spawned the same size, some people like me who recently downloaded start teeny tiny and some people take up half the map! If everyone started the same size it would be fair, because now if you are even a tiny bit small then someone will easily kill you from 4 sides.

Absolutely its pay to win as you get higher in levels [if you really care about winning]. I had a blast until I reached lvl 25. Now as my TIER group goes up I dont stand a chance.....at all. The weapons you CAN afford through in game currency are ok to start, upgrading is essential but the cost is way to high. But by then the p2w guys already have the best stuff."", ""Game was fun until you start playing with the higher leagues. Why as an Expert am I playing with Champions? Teams are always unbalanced and everyone uses the same 2 OP bots. No fun to die in a few seconds from meta weapons and bots. Win or lose it sucks either way.

And you can't do anything. Happened 3 to 4 times now. Please fix this bug. Ty Great overall game. One more thing. Please add about 10 or 20 new maps. Ty"", ""It's still fun. If you want to play for free your not gonna like it. Game is built to aggravate you to buy expensive robots and weapons. Then you have to upgrade them. Takes a ton of resources you also have to buy to stay competitive. Then they added pilots. Pilots are also expensive to upgrade. Now you have to upgrade your Titan. And that is expensive to upgrade too. Might as well buy a real gaming system for the amount of money you will end up spending.🖕"", ""3 stars. Best mech fighting game I've come across for my android device, in saying that however, there are issues you should know first. 1. Lots of pay-to-win in this game, not just cosmetics. So you will face really good geared people. 2. Game stability is honestly the worst, and on a samsung. Game crashes just about every other match. It may freeze before, during or after watching an ad. Sometimes it just crashes on its own, especially during a battle. 3. Tech support garbage."", 'I like this game. The main issue I have with it is that instead of buffing older robots to make them even the slightest bit useful. They sell you a pilot\'l, that after spending thousands in gold to level, will ""upgrade"" the older bot to make it useful again. This is my biggest complaint. You can be pay to win all day I don\'t care. But pay to patch is inane.', 'Great game but it lacks a voice chat so you can strategize with your team. The game is a chaotic, but still fun. Please reduce the time you need to wait to create the big robots that need pieces. The lack of a voice chat really hurts specially in the games that you play with random people. Please make any form of communication, the game will be so much better.', ""Been playing this game about 2 + years. All in all it's a fun game to play. Skirmish is fun to check out bots and weapons. But the advancement is tough as you climb the ranks. The win lose ratio isn't very good. Match up for leagues need more work. If you want to advance towards the top plan on spending big bucks. All in all its a fun game."", ""The game is well and truly fun. A little grindy, especially when you unlock the workshop. However, it lost something. As I started to get higher in the ranks, my game began to crash more and more often. It's nigh unplayable now with how often it crashes. I think it's my older phone not liking 6 v 6. To many particle effects. Still causes me to loose it when game crashes mid match or at the beginning of a match."", ""It's a cool game but when it comes to buying tokens to buy boxes or gold coins to buy chines envelopes it does not give what it should give you. For example instead of hoping to get a very good weapon for your robot either from the boxes or the envelopes it give you puzzles to reach that weapon or silver or gold bricks when you could battle for them. You buy but it doesn't give you what it should be giving you."", ""This is a good game.. i am not a money spender and i could keep up with the other player just by using ads.. but i can't understand about the matching system.. i am a silver player and i was matched with a gold player 6 lv higher than me.. please fix your matching system especially between lv 30+ and under 30.. there is no way we can win when they have a titan while we don't"", ""This is a great game, it's just that it's become more pay to win. It's hard to compete in high leagues. It's still a great game though. It has a tutorial, controls are easy to pick up, has a huge variety of robots, it's just that you can't use old robots or non-meta and have a chance. Early 2017 was the golden era. If it reverts to something similar, I'll 5 stars.

I won't install again."", 'I started playing this game in 2014 shortly after its release, and was a dedicated loyal player up untill around 6 months ago.

The chests only give the bottom prize 99% of the time. The matchmaking is terrible and puts you with players nowhere near your abilities and far above and beyond your level.

You might expect to get a better experience after getting premium. But what do you get after signing up for premium? An option to sign up for premium plus! Ridiculous! Uninstalling after the free trial ends.', ""This game is awesome! Ive been wanting this game for years and i finally got it! I always used to see the ads but I don't need ads if I can actually play it! Thank you so much for making this game! It's kinda like fortnite and I've always wanted to play a sniper game! Thank you Thank you Thank you! For making it free! I love it bye! Oh and btw this game deserves 5 stars!"", 'Really Disappointing, I have been playing this game for few weeks. At the start it was really cool highly addictive. How ever over the last few days the game has become irriting. In particular the PvsP arena well playing connection just cuts off, I used to really enjoy this game I hope the developers fix this problem quickly. And before you guys say check my internet my line speed runs at 1 gig per sec.', 'Game is fun, well done but, epect to pay. Seems everytime you max out your weapon you will need a upgrade soon and this means you need to buy a new gun, then upgrade it for for unrealistic amounts of coins or diamonds. I made it to level 12, cost me 400 bucks. If you want to play this game then dont buy everything they show you. Use what you have until it needs to be upgraded, if you buy, get diamonds because they are a must have. Upper upgrades are on the low end 150k coins, yes 150 thousand.', ""Overall, the game play and the concept is great. However, this game has one major flaw. In PVP mode, this game will often loop you in a pvp map with a lot of players that are ranked a lot higher than you and have much greater gear ratings than you. There are weight classes in combat sports for a reason and this game's algorithm apparently does not take into account players' gear ratings and ranks, which begs the question of why they even exist."", ""It seemed good. Its decent, but buyer beware. If you purchase your piggy bank in the hope of upgrading your arsenal... after you make it to the next tier... suddenly you dont have enough... my diamonds 1300 of them just vanished. Poof.. gone. And wouldn't you know it... I no longer have enough to upgrade my weapon. Seriously, and theres no way to contact support to find out what happened. But hey, I can spend more money to get better weapons No happy at all"", 'Sniper 3d is so fun. I wish I could play more sniper 3d. the perfect game. however, I dont really like how the sniper shoots people. maybe have him shoot ducks. also, maybe less shooting. I didnt download this game to see people die. just have them walking around while you look at them through binoculars like me and my neighbors. they all live such menial lives. to see the human in their natural habitat assuming they are free from my watchful eyes.', ""Good but full of ad delays. Play for about 20seconds. Then if you have failed the mission, have to watch a 1 minute video or vame advertisement. Price to go premium?? Which I hope would mean no ads, is $60!!! That's insane for something I'm just goofing around with while waiting for the dentist. If I could pay a few bucks for a paid ad free version it would have been a good game"", 'Nice game to play . It just not long lasting I ended all the cities and no more missions to do. You have to expend $$$ if you want a decent gun. I got to the last sniper and assault rifles and after all the upgrades still inadequate. The PVP keeps letting players with high gear and weapons come and annihilate the poor ones. How do they get all those goodies do they spend their salary on this game.. for the prices of the weapons you buy real ones at the store and.go shoot at the range cheaper', 'Everything is good UNTIL you get into the PVP arena. For some FU#&ED up reason they will have players that are FAR above the level that you are, and you can literally not get off a shot. You get killed 5-6 or 7 times during the course of the 2 minute game while they are racking up 12 and 15 kills in a room that only has 8 players. IT IS INFURIATING!!!!! IF you download this game then STAY OUT of the PVP area until the programmers can get their collective heads out of their asses and fix this with bracketed arenas!!!', ""It was enjoying in the beginning when I first downloaded it, then it would continuely push you to buy into the game which was nomal at first but then it became overkill and if you didn't give in, it would start messing with your games. It made it impossible to move forward in the game. Then each game was flooded with commercials, then it forced you to update, after the update it change the way your energies were and the game became impossible to control on your phone you could not aim at all."", 'It\'s an... ""ok"" game. But, there are too many people cheating in the pvp. Powerful players intentionally lose to drop down levels and the developers don\'t do anything to address it. In addition, there are way too many ads. It\'s to the point of you\'re spending more time dealing with ads than playing the actual game.', ""It's too difficult to earn the coins or diamonds unless you are willing to pay for them. It's not fun to get put into a PvP arena and get taken out 5 or 6 times and not be able to even get a shot off. If it were a little easier to upgrade weapons AND gear, it would be more competitive and fun to play. I'll spend most of my time else where. Upgrade it to make it more fair and fun and I'll recommend it to friends and family to play as well."", ""You can't enjoy this game with a lot of players with mod version, I paid around 40 USD to get better features and weapons but still it's nothing at all against players with gears of 53200 and special sniper with damage of 10K, And you can't get this sniper because it require to finish the arena challenge which doesn't exist in our version !!! Please stop all players whose haven't sign in by google or facebook account and stop all moded versions of this game. Keep updating the original version!"", ""Too too many ads...then you are seriously pressured into paying for premium. The way they do this is you must upgrade in order to accomplish levels. I'm at level 7 and they have drained every resource I had. Diamonds and coins. Now they exhaust my energy in order to get more money. REAL SHAME. IF YOU WANT TO SPEND MONEY, GOOD GAME. IF YOU WANT TO SPEND HOURS JUMPING THROUGH THEIR HOOPS, GO FOR IT. NOT ME!!!!!"", 'Don\'t download. Can not progress unless you pay money. Steals your diamonds because it acts as if you\'ve ""won"" a piggybank, your diamonds get taken and put into said piggy bank. Want to spend those earned diamonds? Pay E 3,19! Weird way of forcing you to spend money. Want to upgrade weapons? Sure! We just make sure the next mission has needed items you can only get by spending money. Watch 100 ads ~ money to them ofc. But it\'s still not enough because they want you transferring money too.', ""Superb Game play and Graphics. The Levels gets harder and you have 2 online option to score Gold, Diamond and Battle Coins. Only thing is that, don't buy anything, it's just a Honey trap and you will find you are the same position even after putting Real Money. Also they will provide you discounts only when you don't have enough Diamonds. Once you have purchased them, viola forget about discounts. This is so stupid."", 'This game used to be fun. But the developers letting cheat codes and hacks continue has gotten old. But, I\'m sure they made money off the back end of the cheats so don\'t really care. Time to uninstall and move along. Besides, they\'ve been so busy with their new tank game that they haven\'t updated the next city yet. It\'s been ""Coming Soon"" for over 6 months now.', 'Its Exciting and I love it . BUT I dont like the limited conversion methods they force you to pay for when upgrading ... its very F****ing rude and it detours us to keep playing it. There should be missions that accrue war coins as well as diamonds not only money. You will continue to get BAD REVIEWS IF YOU DO NOT CHANGE THIS RUDE PROCESS. FEELS LIKE VIRTUAL EXTORTION. if one likes your game they cannot continue unless they pay hard earned money to do so. VERY INTENSE IN A NEGATIVE WAY.', ""This game gets ridiculously hard the higher levels you go because everything is about money. You have to pay to really advance or get ingame upgrades. I do enjoy the game and its graphics but I refuse to pay. I am well skilled with the mediocre equipment. The author of the game knows little about firearms and sniping. I'm rating higher than I should because of graphics. Ads are incredibly frequent and annoying."", 'Unless you are willing to pay ridiculous amounts for upgrades you are just target practice for those that do. Missions are all basically the same and there is obvious cheating occurring. How can someone get 15+ kills in a 2 minute game where supposedly no one ""knows"" your location unless there\'s something shady going on? Do not download. Not worth the time. And really not worth the money!!!', ""The game is amazing, but I would've given it the 5 stars if not for the cheap move with the piggy-bank and that you have to be premium to open it, and thus, pay for it. Also the diamonds are stored in the piggy bank instead of my personal stash, which is such a bad move. Please work on these problems"", ""I liked this game at first. But there is an ad between every kill. Then you have to buy diamonds or upgrade to get better weapons. By my fifth kill I was sick of waiting for the ad to be done. I don't recommend unless you plan on spending bookoobucks to play. SUCKS!!!!!!"", 'Ads, ads, ads. Ads after every event, and sometimes 2 or three in a row. Game play events might be 10 seconds for an event then watch 30 to 60 seconds of ads. Plus you have to watch more ads to get coins and diamonds to get necessary upgrades. Fun game, but ads ads ads.', 'The ""offers"" are always put above the amount of money you have and I have never been able to use those offers. The ""free trial"" for premium doesn\'t work and it\'s full of ads. The gems/diamonds I get somehow disappear after a while too.', ""The game is cool but when you don't wanna update your game is still makes you And you get to the hard level where you get to the shoot in the guy is the they don't like help you anymore is hoarder every level you step up so that's So that is why it is a 4 star from me and also our love to give the game file stars if it didn't make me update the game when I didn't want To."", ""ADS ADS ADS!!! BUY THIS!!! LOOKIT THIS GAME!!! can't play more than one shot without something you have to do, or some popup you can't dismiss. Could be a cool game IF you didn't have to buy every... Single...

To much else going on with the popups and ads....."", ""Really enjoyed this game , has lots of different scenes to partake in , however it comes to a point where you need to spend cash to move forward ......... As silly as the more expensive the weapon is , the more missions u unlock.......then yet again you need to purchase a more suitable weapon ......the coins or tokens you win can only get you to a point......... All in all it's another way to rob people for money........UNINSTALLED"", 'This is a nice game and I love it but they force u to see ads and spend money on buying new gun and... That is not good.☹️ But okay still I am playing this game.🙂 One more thing when the pigi bank comes most of our diamonds are wasted😕 they tell us to break the pigi bank with our own money.😔', ""The only problem that I'm experiencing is adverts after each and every online mission and it takes much data. Especially those adverts that doesn't offer rewards. Please do something about it. But otherwise, I really enjoy each and every moment I spend on the game."", 'Was good up until I see you have to buy jewels to excel in the game. Level 10 and I have to put cash and lots of it if I want to gain any futher. So as much as I like it (deleting) I cant pay to play that much money.', ""I would rate this 4.5 if I could, but I can't. Great game, but can you make the opening the piggy bank part free? Because it's really annoying how I get 150 gems in there and I have to pay to get them. If you can change that though, that'd be great! Apart from that, the game's completely fine. Edit:Woah! You're from Ireland? I'm in England!"", ""It's not a bad game but dont bother doing pvp it's nothing but cheating the pvp is sniper rifle but I see players using full auto rapid fire like minigun steams of bullets kill you before you respawning have low gear rate health but are bullet proof like they have 100,000 gear rating cant kill them so just do normal missions you're better off the other problem is now you have to wait until they make more missions after you get to last mission it says coming soon maxed weapons sit and wait"", ""Annoying Game, Very good but it won't let you play for more than a mnt before it shows Ads , I think the price to upgrade a weapon is too much. It is a very annoying,and they annoy you with adds on purpose so you make the purchase."", ""What the hell did you guys do to the update, the game now lags in pvp like it's abit slow and distorted, my phone's ram is 4gb so I really confused on what could be wrong. The game wasn't like this before. The was really nothing wrong with the previous version till this upgrade, I regret upgrading. It's abit frustrating please fix it."", ""It's super fun, but it's a bit too easy sometimes. So I'm Hoping it will get more challenging. It's offline also! No internet needed to play.

New added contents are also fun! I hope some gliches when playing in multiplayer mode can be fixed. Our weapons multiplied when picking up another weapon, then picking up the weapon earlier, as well as some items drops. Hoped for that to be fixed. But, I really recommend this game!', 'I played this game for 3 years just about, and I still play it today. Very Enter the Gungeon-y game style, and amazing weapon variety. Great game overall. Although, I think that disabling autofire would make for more challenging gameplay. And it should also be on PC. Just some advice, bringing it to PC would improve marketing, so please consider it. Thank you!', 'This is a nice mix between RPG and bullet hell genre, I also like the retro art style. My only complains are that a lot of nice characters are locked behind a paywall, and there are only 3 main dungeon levels that you go through in order to Finnish a run, there are however around 7 variations of dungeons. I would like to see more added to the game.', ""Exelent experoence, i've played for almost 4 years now and I can say it has improved enormiously, great soundtrack (never boring), great gameplay, better with friends, etc... I would love if they added leveling, so you can level your account by playing, and also level the characters by using them, and then that gives you benefits, but the game is 10/10 for me, not very realistic opinion but the best game ever played on mobile"", 'This game is incredible. But, I am mainly writing this review to provide critical feedback. Asking people to pay for characters, and not even just a single character but many, is somewhat ridiculous. While i love the game, i would like to be able to play as all the characters without dropping over ten dollars. I would ask the devs to make characters available for in-game currency, as the developers already receive profit from donations, purchase of in-game currency, and purchase of garden plots', ""Soul Knight is a great rogue-like, dungeon based RPG with lots of features and items. I'd recommend this to alot of people and my friends because it's just a great game. But the thing is that the gameplay gets old from time to time but at least you can get other characters, try experimenting, and lots of achievements and challenges you can try. And updates! I played this game since 2017 and it's just great. absolutely great. a few bugs and exploits need to be fixed and just a great community."", 'A pretty good game with great controls and lots of content. The makers of the game are pretty consistent with updating the game and keeping the game fresh.

I should have played this earlier. Unlike those overrated, shallow, asset-flipping money-grab which only exists to make easy $ like Archero & clones, I can feel that devs worked on this game with genuine passion.

First of, the ads aren't forced to you like they're you're mother trying to spoon feed you for the first time.

Lastly the artslye is very unique."", 'Amazing game, with a lot of interactive facilities that have a lot of use with each being advantage to player, there is a lot of diversity in enemies and weapon with different rarities. Also a home menu where you can explore a lot of thing.

We always do some challenge of our own when playing the game. I wish that you could add a new mode in for multiplayer like the one in singleplayer. The wave mode.

It would be great to access the saved progresses on an Android device from the iOS devices. It would be also great to have an online multiplayer rather that just the local one."", ""I like the game, it's just that I think you should make more characters available to users who play for free.

Idk if this is even a bad thing just makes the game less simply good. Also, one MAJOR problem is that in wave mode randomly you will lose progress and if you're on wave 100+ and you want to take a break, you lose ALL of your rewards and 500 gems you spent to play it"", ""Soul Knight,an absolutely amazing dugeon crawler there is never a dull moment with randomly generated everything and challenges to spice things up you can craft and grow weapons and at least 3 bosses you can get one of in each level and playing with your friends makes it even better but don't take my word for it try it yourself."", 'I would give it 5 stars but everytime me and my friend try to play multiplayer, even though we are on the same wifi, it does not work. It gives some weird error code. We even restarted our phones and it still didnt work although we did have the same new updated version.', ""In my short experience, I already love almost everything about this game. The pixel art style is something I've always loved, the fluid controls, how easy it is to pick up, IT'S FREE, the fact that it's multiplayer, how smooth it is, everything. My only criticism is the lack of servers so people in different places can play together! If this game had servers so I could play with distant friends, I'd be ALL over it!"", 'The game is great, really fun, although some characters i have to buy with money, but there fairly low so it didnt disturb me, but could it be possible if you guys could make the local multuplayer less laggy there are momments where the game kicks me out, also one last thing, it would really make my day if you guyd could make online multiplayer, that woukd be the best thing ever. Besides that i dint see much of any bad things besides lag in local multiplayer great game keep it up 👍', ""I've been playing sense beta and still most played game on my phone you guys last big update with the armour suits and I suggested it you guys did it and added a few extra extras to boot I got a tiny add on of being able to craft weapon upgrades as well as weapons ex: lava stone. Thanks again you guys are awesome keep up the amazing work."", ""it was great until the last update. i always play multiplayer with my brother and we have lots of fun. but after the last update we couldn't play multiplayer even once! please fix this problem. even though we're using the same wifi we can never play multiplayer."", ""I'm always a big fan of pixelated games. Pixelated games just give out so much color and are so vibrant, its satisfying to play with, especially when the game is a dungeon crawler. Another thing is that i love randomized generation. We may rely on luck but it's still extremely fun cause you don't know what's ahead of you and it's always a mystery. Soul Knight has got to be one of the best mobile games. But i wish there was online multiplayer not just local, so we can have fun with others online."", ""Great game. I love that there are so many weapons there are swords, guns, axes , speaes, bows, and hammers. I only wish that you could leave the game more than once. I take my time and the time from beginning to completion is around 1 hour and I can't always complete the game when I get on only twice. Otherwise, this is one of the best mobile games I have played in a long time."", 'Its a great game overall excpet for one problem that i really hate. Whenever I go to the forge table i look at the Gold Laser Sword and it says i already forged it(which i did) but when my game crashed after i forged it, it restarted my game and the game had shown me that i never had the gold sword. I even went to the basement where all the trophies are and checked and it still says i dont have the golden laser sword even though the game tells me I unlocked it in the forge. Please fix this. Thx', 'One of the best mobile games out there, I just wish you could earn all characters through in game currency, also a online co-op. Edit: after playing more of the local co-op, it can get very laggy depending on the amount of projectiles on screen.', 'This game is amazing! I liked the fact that the devs mixed cute characters with monsters to fight, as it is quite fun! There are barely any ads (only to get a better weapon before a run or to get gems). The only problem I have is that I would like more ways to get gems. Overall, I would recommend this to people who like pixelated fighting rpgs.', ""Great time killing. Very fun. I love that we can enter into random world and fight different monsters. It would be better if you can add an option to let us choose which world we like to go. Oh, the option is only available for normal. Badass isn't available to choose because it's badass. Thank you."", 'So...The game is amazing, has amazing graphics a great Gameplay and good controls that could improve a bit,along with an optimization in camera drive especially in multiplayer that happens to be a lot of fun but could be even better as the buffs being by vote and the loot being equal to all players the camera is the main problem I see in the game if it were centered on the player would be much better. Also the horde mode could have a multiplayer option. And get all characters with game currency.', ""So this game is actually pretty good. If you're looking for an offline game that's fun, with ads that are OPTIONAL (you can revive once with ads) then definitely get this game. However, my only complaint is that you can't unlock all the characters, as some cost real money to unlock. The characters you can unlock for free are all powerful and fun to play with though, so I guess it doesn't matter.

If you're a fan of games like Binding of Isaac then this is something similar in its rogue-type like dungeon gameplay. I play almost every day because I enjoy the daily challenges. It could do with correcting some of the descriptions of the some of the buffs. Some of the characters I found kind of useless, even though theyre expensive to buy with in-game money or real money, but luckily my fav is the first one you're given anyway.

The game is as hard or easy as you make it, and it's possible to play without spending anything or watching ads. The biggest plus is my husband and I can play over local hotspot/wifi during plane trips and during long waits."", ""Oh! This new update was fantastic! I've been expecting a little more of the story and a new chanllenge. Weapons and boss, nice. New skins, great. But, I got a little problem. Sometimes, the game gets so, so much lag, making even impossible to move, or fight, especially in the new mode. I am very satisfied with this update. The work was great. And, I know it's not easy fix some bugs in the game, but, I hope you can fix the game to be more fluid and fix the lag. The rest, was a great work"", ""This game has an unusually brutal difficulty at times, but it is well worth it. I love the design of the characters and environment, and the number of unique weapons is amazing. The challenge of winning the game makes you work hard to improve your skills, and the different heroes allow for many potential playstyles. It has its glitches, but those that there are aren't gamebreaking, so it is an otherwise very stable game."", ""I have been playing this game for 2 y. already. The gameplay is fun, the charachters are different the enemies even more. I enjoy the bullet-hell that the game sometimes puts you through. The adds are all optional(second chance, more gems, better weapon in the beginning). Only the half of the characters can be purchased for in game currency, but it is a great deal(you don't get all the characters for free and at the same time you don't get the annoying adds). The game is totally worth your money""]"
Last Day on Earth: Survival,zombie.survival.craft.z,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=zombie.survival.craft.z&hl=en&gl=us,"The survival shooter Last Day on Earth is set in a post apocalyptic world: in 2027 the world saw an outbreak of an unknown infection that destroyed almost all the human race. And it didn’t stop there. All those dead started turning into zombies and those few survivors that have resistance in their blood are trying to survive on the ruins of the once great world.

And now the survival of your character is only in your power! Keep an eye on your character’s life stats such as hunger and thirst, collect valuable resources for crafting, create weapons and transport of different types or use what you have at hand: a bat or a road sign. Everything will come in handy for killing dozens... hundreds…thousands of zombies!

Defeat intruders to your land not only with your power but also cunning – construct fortifications with traps or go raid other survivors’ territories for the sake of rare loot and resources. After all people can do anything to survive. 

Hardcore fans will have plenty to do in tough seasonal locations. Before going to a desperate trip, equip your survivor with the most crushing weapon to hunt wild animals and destroy crowds of mutated zombies. One can reach seasonal location on a transport that’s available for crafting. Moreover if you pass the wall on the west of the map you will enter an online location where with a special costume on, you will be able to interact with other players. 

Explore the large and deep-laid world of Last Day on Earth! Upgrade your hero, equip your house, loot abandoned territories, hunt wild animals and other survivors – the new world has new rules.

An option of saving game progress in case of phone lost/break is also missing. But very good game!!', 'Idk if it\'s just me but i constantly unable to gain access to the game by giving me a pop-up saying ""unable to connect to the server-"" and asking to check my internet connection when my internet is working fine. Also, whenever i get into the game, it always lags and then automatically brings me out of the game. And when i retry it does the same thing, over and over again. Few days back everything was fine but it gets worse starting today. Please fix this cause i really love this game\'s concept.', 'I just installed before 2 weeks ago. The game is simply awesome. Such a great design, players can be motivated to achieve more things and levels. Not boring actually. Fentastic game I ever seen. In the perspective of a gamer, No time will be wasted in this game.

It was a great effert from your side. Thank you guys', ""As I progress further in the game, I can see what the critical reviews are saying. You lose stuff, despite watching ads for energy, you can't go back to reclaim. Turret becomes completely impossible to cross, No rewards in bunker after killing very high level zombies. Gun temporarily given to me is asking me to buy it, expected. I expect it to become completely pay to progress soon. Pathetic, initially I thought you guys really based this game on strategy but it's just another profit machine"", 'It is a nice survival game, I play it for hours. But, I have some suggestions. There should be a infections because you get spit at by toxic and in a few seconds, your fine. Why not add infections to be aware of and medicine to cure it. Also, you get hit by zombies and horrible creatures all the time and not even a germ.', 'A really fun game. The only issue I have is, that dying in zones like pine woods, or other instantly resetting zones is deleting all your stuff. I would enjoy it if zones that normally reset instantly would reset in a couple of minutes, so you can get your stuff back. Maybe something like: Green zones:2 minutes Yellow zones:4 minutes Red zones:8 minutes (After you leave the zone) But only in instantly resetting locations. I hope something like this would maybe possible to do.', 'New update came out today but suddenly it keep telling me to restart, and whenever i reset it, it saying to restart it again or i lost my connection!

I gave 3 stars because I'm pretty much stuck in the game. I cant get the chopper gas tank and cannot progress until then. I have made the trip to bunker alpha countless times hoping to get it. It's just not happening. You should make these type things a little easier to obtain. Playing for over a year to find yourself stuck is disheartening. If these rare items were a little easier to obtain, I would give the game 10 stars."", ""2 stars because the games is setup for purchase only. It starts out with a minimal amount out coins after that you either wait the day to recharge or you can pay for it. There's no way to earn free coins.

Trouble is it takes forever to advance in the game without spending money, and even if you do spend money, it\'s short lived. All your equipment eventually fails, wears out, or breaks.

Loved playing but I have to delete this one and find something else.', 'Honestly an incredible game. but the body recovery system seriously needs reworking. You should be able to find multiple of your own bodies, or at the very least, if you die the first time, go back to get your stuff, and die a second time without picking anything at all up beforehand, you should not lose everything in your first body.

Respectable graphics and enjoyable premise for the game. That being said certain aspects do need a little tweaking. The energy aspect of the game make sense but the energy regen rate is far too slow 10 mins for 2 energy isnt a very good trade.

In my opinion I don\'t really agree with the travel time "" if you\'re on foot "" going to a location damn near to your beginning base. Also a cool idea for developers I would suggest is. What if you could just make the durability last longer on your melee weapons or firearms. Instead of repairing it every time it gets down to 50% durability.', 'The game itself is very addictive and pretty good. One massive problem: It crashes every time I try to load it or if I try to enter a new zone or return home, which you have to do all the time, it crashes. If I keep trying to load it, it will eventually load but this is after 5-10 tries each time which takes about 15mins each time. Imagine doing this every time you want to play or more frustrating, every time to enter a zone or return home. It is very, very,very frustrating.

Only problem is the discipline of the players."", 'Good. A nice and easy version of League of Legends, basically. However, I feel like the violation-reporting is very easy to misuse. For example, tonight I had a bad game and people reported me, even I was using a new hero and was experiencing lag. Kind of bollocks when you have a bad game and get a violation and penalty, just for testing out a new hero.', 'Unfair match-ups and unbalanced heroes. When I play on any mode I always get matched with people who are ranked higher than my team. The heroes are so unbalanced. Whenever I play the enemy team always has so much exp that within the first five minutes of the game, they are already 2 levels ahead of us and maybe 3 levels. And also, this is a pay to win game: the skins have attributes, you level up ur emblems with MONEY. How about the players who have pure skill? These last updates were horrible.', ""The game itself is very good and one of the best or maybe the best moba out there so far but the downside of this game is the community, like there is alot of people trolling to make the team lose and they've never punished, maybe they have punished but still can play this game...like I've experienced just now, my team literally say that he is gonna be trolling us. So that's the very bad side of this game, the gaming community..."", 'So I have played this for years. (Before they even called it ""Bang Bang"") and very slowly it has turned into something ugly.

After reaching the highest elo youre still stuck playing with WAY lower rank than you 95% of the time that the motivation of players ranking up diminish the satisfaction.', ""Honestly if the skins weren't expensive and players were actually good and the matchmaking was decent this game would be 5/5 but sadly it gets a three since it basically doesn't have this.

It would be even better experience for gamers if the characters would have more skills than standard 3 The only problem with it is the unfair system that alway penalizes even those who have played well or playing the character for the first time or the game itself.

Twice this game has crashed when on the events, anytime you get close to earning one of the big guns, it crashes and I have to reinstall and start again!

Seriously annoying."", ""I enjoy playing this game, but it is seriously flawed. Events frequently disappear, leaving you unable to complete quests. The game constantly freezes during gameplay, and that further hampers your ability to complete quests.

None of this would bother me if I didn't have to pay for some of the features."", ""I would rate this a five star if it wasn't so expensive to obtain upgrades and the screen going black and you lose what you were going for.

The point is this game, while fairly exciting, has the same problems scattered across users. Play ""freezing"", resetting play and losing all gains and being kicked out of the game during ads. However, the most unforgivable issue is the lack of empathy and understanding from game developers. So find a different game!', ""Don't waste any money on this one, when you upgrade your guns it makes the zombies harder to kill so you don't gain anything. All my guns are 10 star or better and I have close to 500 battles at each location and I can no longer win a battle unless I buy boosters, you can't win them fast enough to play.

I upgrade my gun to a point its killing zombies with one shot, next level with same gun it takes 4-5 shots per zombie. I know levels are labeled with a difficulty, but to me that should be a change in the quantity and frequency of the zombies and not the effectiveness of the weapon.

Edit: heard there was an update. It has even more ads lol"", 'It used to be a smooth gameplay without any lag. Nowadays, my game keeps lagging and even shut down a few times midgame. Fix this please. It was a fun game while it lasted. The upgrading has also become really slow. The chance to get more points for upgrading equipment has definitely dropped after the new update. Extremely hard for free to play players to upgrade at an acceptable speed.', ""You really need to make something with the attack, instead of attacking the mobs next to me, it 's attacking the one that remain far, but the one that move next to me fast doesnt attack. I have to move and then attacks the one next to me. It s really really annoying. And the bosses when they hit you deals different damage, is a bug too i think, because i had the same stats and equipment. I hope you solve this problems fast."", ""I just started playing this game more often now and it's kind of upset me. Next to only have 20 energy, (4 games), I feel like the grind feels like a hassle because even the most common of gear rarely drop, taking weeks to upgrade it and progress so you can finally finish that level that's been so difficult to beat. I feel as someone who stupidly has put about 40$ into the game, I should have infinite energy to use so I can properly progress. It's a super fun game btw."", ""The game was fun, graphics are nice and the mechanics are simple. The problem is; The game was a good challenge, but now, they've released so many 'bad' skills and upped the difficulty of the game, that it becomes a frustrating experience. I've been playing for about 10 months and the last update killed it for me. You might enjoy it for a bit, but that's it. Don't waste time / money"", ""The game has a really nice gameplay. I've been playing for 8 months but giving up now. It's just pissing me of the lack of value it has. To upgrade your gear to the highest level you need to invest hundreds of $$. This is crazy!!! A premium top rated ps4 game is 60$. Guys, with the amount of money that you need to invest to have max gear in this game., you could literally buy a ps4, a mobile phone, a ps4 game and play on your mobile via remote play. And you wonder why people hack this game :)"", ""First, this game is super fun. I've spent hours playing this. If you played binding of isacc, you'll love this game. I also just want to say, out of all the game ads I see on Snapchat, this has been the only one to do ingame ads the right way. Ads should be opt in by the player, and not shown after you die. Thank you for doing this!"", ""Pros : Fantastically addictive app! Great game play with heaps of enemy types and lots of weapons and armor too! You really feel powerful when you kick the ass of the big bosses and that makes you want to play more! Cons : It would have been 5 stars but you do get error messages quite often. Connection errors are annoying. I've spent coins on upgrades and they haven't worked which is frustrating. Fix the errors, get 5 stars all day. Thank you."", ""First of all, I downloaded this game after seeing an ad for it only to discover the gameplay in the ad was nowhere to be found. Despite that, it's a pretty fun game to pick up and pay for a couple minutes at a time. Unfortunately, it's mired by a strange ad system that either doesn't work or freezes and makes you lose progress. Would have been a 5 star game without the false advertising and buggy ad system."", 'fantastic game. it is fun and all. but energy system sucks. if you dont have energy you have to wait ( about an hour) to play again. give players more time to play without paying for more energy. i hope developer wont limit the energy that we can get from ads. after energy is depleted its ok for me f i have to watch an add for 5 energy ( without limit).', 'Not the game promised but a happy alternative. I actually really enjoy this game. The game play is quick and fast paced with what seems to be a pretty easy leveling up system at the moment. It forces you to wait until certain levels giving plenty of time to save. I will say however.. I clicked this via one of their adverts in which to play the game you created the map guiding the monsters. Not running around shooting them. False advertising but great game none the less', 'The game is really fun and I enjoy it a lot. However, the monetization is down right atrocious. You have your standard Gems like most phone games, which is fine I suppose, and they even have ""sales"" almost every day it seems. Where I have a problem is the cost of the characters. You get 2 for free, but then you have to buy the rest. $18 for one character?! No thanks. However, I haven\'t felt that I need to buy anything. So that\'s a plus. If the characters weren\'t so expensive, 5/5.', ""This is a very fun game (sometimes rage-inducing) in general! I love how simple the mechanics works and how smooth gameplay is. Plus it's not a pay-to-win kind of game so it's really enjoyable. I kinda wish I could save my progress and back it up as well though. I had to re-install on another device bc the previous one I was using is gone so I have to restart all the progress I've made from world 1-8 :("", 'Hi guys! Thank you for creating such an entertained, creative and fun mobile game like this. The best part is that it can even be played offline and anywhere, but I think it would be so awesome if you guys could also add online mode as well, such as PvP or 2v2 or even Co-op, fighting with your friends. I hope that there will be more and more NEW Modes, Equipments, Maps, Modes, Boss and Monsters and variety of SKILL POWERS in the game, maybe even new characters. Thank you and keep it up!', 'Really enjoyed playing this game for a long time. It falls off once you get to the later levels. I hate that you have to pick one of the random generated items that you get as you level up in the castles. Especially when they keep offering the worst items available. This game is fun for a while but really gets you frustrated in the higher levels.', ""A simple game to pick up with depth, longevity and a high difficulty ceiling. The range of equipment and abilities in conjunction with the in-game level-up system really makes this game shine. I particularly love/hate the double-edged nature of certain upgrades. The combination of enemy projectiles and your own creates a disorienting bullet-hell scenario, adding a subtle layer of difficulty that commands respect. I'm conscious of the addictive features... Yet here I still am."", 'This is such an amazing game! I love everything that this app has to offer but I have a slight problem with something which is the control of the character because sometimes he acts on his own and goes in the direction that you were pointing at even tho you lifted your finger off the trigger. Fix that and i will give you 5 stars for sure!!', 'I really enjoyed this game but now it is plain ruined with these new ""power-ups"" that you don\'t want and the ones that you really want (like diagonal arrows, multishot and wall bounce, bolt) rarely ever are offered. FIX YOUR GAME! I won\'t be wasting anymore time dying and watching ads until you make those specific power-ups more frequent. It is not fun to play anymore.', ""I love this game! I have a couple suggestions though: Could you put a feature to compare different items without taking into account its level? If I have a lv 15 weapon and I have another one but it's not upgraded yet I have no idea if it's better to dismantle the one I already have or not and It is automatically destroyed if I try it so It's difficult for me to compare stats. It would be cool if you could upgrade the sound on this game because I feel like it's OK but it could be better."", 'At the beginning the game was great. I was giving a 4/5 stars.. Now the game getting worst. It was my favorite game on my cellphone. But now the game is getting garbage. NEW SKILLS are very lame and worst . Instead getting new s**t skills, improve performance on characters , more new characters or pets . STOP doing new skills, your making the game worsted.', ""This game *was* good... Then the difficulty ramping got out control. Devs constantly adding useless abilities just simply lowers the chance of getting 1 of 3 abilities needed to win. The entire game becomes stagnant around stage 10 or so. Seriously, unbeatable bosses and enemies spawning on top on you. It's painfully obvious that you can't even pay to win this game if you wanted. *Update* Devs say go farm for equipment... not when I've been playing for 5 months. It was fun while it lasted."", ""The game is fun but too many skill are useless. It's worth it to consider modifying either the damage output or at least the range of the sword skills and orb skills. If not it would be better to remove them all together as they just take away from possibly getting a useful skill. Make some fixes and this is easily a 5 star game."", ""Lots of fun right out the gate, but goes downhill fast. I'm all for hard levels and grinding, grinding because I don't want to pay, but weeks of grinding for minimal progress just isn't wort it. If it's not meant to be free, rather charge upfront. I think an opportunity missed. Edit 02/17/2020 I've installed the game again and after playing for a while. Big improvements all round. Levels feel more balanced and much smoother controls. More loot also which makes the grind worth it. Well done."", 'Overall a really good game. Please fix the hitbox of some monsters. You should as well include a bestiary with tge monsters we encounter. it would be useful to know their powers and abilities. Another thing that i would like to see is my attack and attack speed while playing and how it increases through power ups Updade: this game is now full with useless skills. They increased unnecessarily the damage of the events. Each creature dealing almost 75% of your hp.', ""Concept is good. Low rating because this game literally punishes you for being good at it. The skill curve is insane. The amount of time it takes to build up equipment is rediculous. The new skills they try and implement are garbage, because they dont actually do anything, OR are so stupid it doesnt make sense. It's a punishment to get them to begin with. Then they punish you while you're playing for getting them."", 'I\'m really enjoying the game, it\'s challenging yet alot of fun and I can play for hours when I get into it. I\'m having an issue now where I can\'t watch ads when there\'s prompts to do so. It says ""ad not ready yet"" , it\'s getting very frustrating! I\'m finding it to affect the gameplay as I feel like I\'m missing out on opportunities to help me progress. I will gladly change my rating to 5 stars if this is fixed.', ""Game is designed to make you either empty your wallet or waste your time. I've have a good experience with the game except for the fact that three of my weekly purple chests just didnt give me anything and instead made me watch an ad. Otherwise, this game is quality compared to the other games offered on the play store."", 'Gameplay is rewarding and fun. I dont really like how there are loot chests and you have to watch ads but the gameplay makes up for that. The energy is kinda annoying when you are playing on a day to day basis. It is a great game that I think you would enjoy if you like the binding of isaac and other rouglikes.', ""The game's good and interesting, grindy and satisfactory, however there's couple of completely retarded mechanics: 1. RNG of skills sometimes it gives you 2 or 3 of the same skill, so not much of a choice. 2. Enemy targeting - from what I see it works on the closest enemy only, sometimes I maybe wanna target enemies that are not behind walls. 3. RNG of levels makes most of the time usage of skills like attack speed plus completely useless bcs u get cucked in a corner. 4. There's a max-cap stats."", ""Please add a skill page, so we could learn what does skills do to the hero. We have to try the new skills to know the exact effect that it makes, and it would be so much better if there is a skill explanation page. Also, there are some skills that I don't want to use at all, it would be so much better if we could exclude some skills. But overall this is a very good game."", ""I like this game, I'm level 52 and I'm on 10 Land of Doom and it is very hard to pass from here because when you have lots of mobs appearing from everywhere the character you play, shoot everywhere and I don't have time to react. I gave only 4 STARS because they should update the pointing targets by manually because it the only things that this game needed in order to be playable to be perfect. P. S. - I will keep leaving feedbacks till they will change the way it targets. Thanks."", ""Dont normally rate games but this is just too good. The ads dont did it justice. Ads are non intrusive, so far plenty of powerups and when I die it's from my inability to dodge attacks not the game trying to force you into micro transactions. It is a fair and balanced game with the normal moble game traps but perfectly playable and tons of fun. I sent it to everyone I know it's that good."", ""Still the same complaints. You'll get stuck on certain dungeons (7, 8, 10, 11, 13 if I remember correctly) for months, unless you pay to get better equipment because the enemies are seriously overpowered and the game throws a ton of cheap bullshi* at you. You'll start a level and immediately have walls of projectiles and melee enemies inches away, making it impossible to move without getting hit. I can deal with challenging. I can't stand dying because of cheap shots."", ""Fun game but you need to watch ads and sync to thier server doesn't sound too bad but for whatever reason it can't do it over wifi the ads are eating my data. :( Hopefully they can fix it. Update has a thing popping up every minute to ask you to watch an ads for in game stuff if you (you could watch it every hour or every 72 hours and it give you the same overall why does it pop every minute when ready then?) Very annoying let me click it if I want the reward."", 'Was 4 star. Then gorilla made it 1 star. Newest update is 0 stars. The pay to win was bad, but they added ways to make it possible to play without paying. Recently added some really bad upgrades, which nerf the customization& power level of the gear. Now the grind is slower &more incremental. The pay to win is stronger because the per try upgrades are weaker. Before you could get lucky on roulette every few runs now the roulette is bad so slow upgrades are the only option.', ""I really love this game. The graphics are nice and it doesn't get boring. However: it's really annoying that sometimes the game just crashes in the middle of fighting. The progress I've made is gone, as well as all the coins, weapons, scrolls and sapphires I've already earned in that round. It's especially annoying when it happens in something like the spring festival (it did) because even though the progress is gone it did save my run as an attempt and I can't try again without buying."", ""Been playing this outstanding game for the pass few months, but iv recently have found a few bugs that are starting to get annoying. Recently iv tried to open the game only for it to crash. Another problem is the gameplay stability. Idk what happened recently but its so glitchy that I accidentally upgraded a common bird ring when I was trying to switch tabs bc it was glitched. If the devs could look into this, I'd b more than happy to give a 5 star re-review."", ""Amazing game! For the sake of improvement, few ideas/constructive criticism : -An option to skip the one by one item leveling up. -Boomerang bug fix, they disappear when too close to walls. -Shouldn't be two of the same ability on one roll of the ability choice. (and no penetration ability for the boomerang) -Stat upgrade in percent so it stays worth it -A cool mode that combines the 4 elements on elemental abilities (eg : 4 swords at once)""]"

I found the systematic progression very good. some people might not like the difficult pace but I really loved it. it was well worth the grinding. there are some secrets which you have to find for yourself though. all in all extremely fine game. really hyped for the new updates!!"", ""Fun game but you'll want to play through and get the hang of it the first time and then restart over probably. You're going to want to try to hit the warehouse before level 20 consistently to start getting the equipment for your bicycle. This game is pretty in-depth features for a phone game. Even though I am not much for paying for things on phone games I've even caught myself purchasing on here just to support the Developers. I would strongly recommend watching walk-throughs on the warehouse"", ""I've been looking for this kind of survival game for the longest time. Just started playing and I'm hooked. This would mean, hours of nonstop gaming. Just hoping I dont ran out of water and energy. Haha. I still gave it a 5star for being a wonderful game. But for other players who will play this game in the future for them to give the same rating you should improve the inventory slot."", 'I really like the content of the game, but you have limited stamina and the game uses it for everything. Basically you are severly limited in everything you can do to force you to progress slow. By slow i mean simple tasks like gathering enough wood to fuel all your production and cooking and building means repeated trips to the grove to get wood, but you only get 2 stacks, which burns all your stamina and you need to go find something else to do for an hour or so while it recharges.', ""UPDATE- add some voice overs to all the letters and things you find, will make it much more enjoyable! But still, a great game. By far the most enjoyable mobile survival game I've played!! So much to do, and even more to loot. The enemies are gorgeous, terrifying and fun. The graphics are beautiful. The story you play through is actually interesting and the characters are intriguing. Would be great to see more things to build and craft in the future, but so far very well done 5***** 🤗"", 'Great game. Long, slow grinding unless you pay. Been playing for a few months now, decent progress. One of my favorites though, I play every day. Events let you earn good stuff at all levels to help you regardless of progress. Would give 5 stars, but it tends to lock up frequently which is annoying. Thankful the load times are not painful so that helps. Keep up the great work guys! This one rocks! 🤘', ""Graphic and the way you collect raw items was nice. The bad side of this game, you need lots of money to go to next level. Why money? I tell you why.. 1) the durability of your bought items will decayed with damage or killing zombies, so you will always need to buy new Equipments and weapons from the Mall(real money used here). 2) In your hunting maps, there will be maps that will eat your all your Equipments and weapons. You may die inside that map when you'r unlucky..( i lost my Legendary..)"", ""Wonderful! Absolutely wonderful! So easy to play, so easy to beat! Oh, and challenging! Wanna know how easy? Well, for just a few easy payments of your hard earned cash, an arm, a leg, or maybe your soul, you can get all the gear you'll need...for about 5 minutes or so; until it breaks or you die. Like challenges? Great! Try this game where you can experience the joys of having your ass repeatedly handed to you as the game becomes increasingly one-sided, every time you gain a level."", ""Graphics and storyline are top notch, variation of enemies from cannibals, wolves to zombies. Lots to appreciate. Besides the small pouch that has very limited space at the start and energy depletion after farming at 1 place is too quick. There's not a lot of complaints. I wouldn't play the game too long unless you bought gear with real money."", ""Blacks out when I enter basement. This game is awesome though. And I was really happy when I found it. But I cant progress anymore, not being able to enter the basement. I have enough ram, space etc, so it's not that. It's only done it for basement. The screen goes dark and there is nothing. There is still sounds and the monster even killed me while I was in there."", ""but Much better then most games if the type... but still a few bugs issues balance is better then tou'd rhink at first (you get stronger and get better loot and quests and rewards as you level..) other then that.. fairly fine.. Looking to see more content that'll be nice.. and a insentive to pay for... Since right now paying simply gives you such things as armor and beats the game... so clearlly yet in beta...(feels that way at least..)"", 'My experience has been good. This game is fun but its very difficult to move forward. The experience levels rise too quickly and opens items that are unable to be crafted. The weapons and tools break too quickly and the enemies are too strong. The hits are always different. So this problem is making the game kind of boring and repetative. Im gonna hang in there and see if I will ever make it to the warehouse.', ""First survivor game I've played. Like the concept but spend way to much time trying to keep up with weapons food and cloths. I get it but having to build new weapons every time you go out is dumb. Cloths last a 2 or 3 hours of play time, dumb. It takes a lot of your resources to keep up with these so you don't have much inventory to collect other things you need to move on. Wolfs coming out of no where to attack you while in a building is also dumb."", ""I love this game hands down already. I played last day on earth forever and the game just was slow dragging in development and I never felt any real purpose and it didnt feel like they cared about their fans or fan base but right from the start you can tell this game had a goal and wanted to please there fans great game let's of fun and different things in here thank you for creating this !"", ""After playing on a couple days, it is hard to play all missions, the dev always give an option to buy an equipments. Once you bought it and you die, all your equipment lost even in the event mission if you go back to your shelter first. I went back to shelter is just to re-equip my character and fall back to the location I die, but when I go to the world map, that event mission is gone. And the dev offers you to buy again. I'm tired and I'm uninstall it."", 'Very good game, but there are anoying parts to it. Tagger respawns far too quickly. Wolves are a pain in the rear end. And respawns too quickly. Constantly being asked to rate a game you have given 5 stars to is annoying. Using more energy when in the shelter than outside is plain wrong. Not pausing the game whilst browsing storage is odd. I think food and water is used more at this time? Over all though it is a 5 star game. Good graphics and storyline. And no one raiding me yet.', ""Just outstanding gaming innovation. Very complex and you have to approach it in a strategic manner. Everything is affected depending on how you want to tackle the challenges. Smooth gameplay and can be rewarding with abit of patience. Although go and explore unprepared and you will pay the price. It's far from perfect but its a very good attempt. Specially with the other competition out there. It's definitely up there as one of the best for it's genre."", 'Thanks for discord link, i got it working!! Amazing! Will update as i explore more of the game! I did and ....its perfect! Story is great and the game is play to win! Have not seen a game like this in so very long and that is What makes ot Unique! Support is great and so is the community i cannot wait for the future of this awe inspiring adventure!', ""This game can be so frustrating but it's also incredibly well made. You really need to strategize and hoard to get anywhere. My only suggestions; It'd be nice to find a gun or ammo every now and again. Would be amazing if we could have pets like dogs and horses! Maybe tame a wolf. When putting things from my pockets into storage boxes it'd be great for there to be another button that transfers only what is already in the box."", ""First I rate this with 5 stars. This the first game that I'm spending money for. I'm disappointed. I went in the warehouse for the first time and the boss attacked me right after I've opened the fist door (with claw next to him). I've managed to kill him but after 5 sec he was summoned back again. I've watched so many videos and in none of them the doors after (the blue ones) warrent open. And the boss is not coming right after the entrance. I'm out of supplies. DELETE."", ""Best mobile survival game I've played. A balance game even though I haven't spent money for it yet. Good sound, good graphic. But still, the attack range is the most annoying, prevent the game to be better, hope you will fix it. Plus, i wish you'll develop the multiplayer function or create more diversifies strategies in the side-quests. Thanks for your hard work until now, still one of a best survival game, 5 star absolutely <3"", ""Like most of these stamina goes away way to fast. Your drink and water supply drains to fast and of course the materials needed to make anything is to small. I understand the need to make it difficult since it is a survival game. Also the use of stamina is an old tactic to get people to not play without paying so that could be changed. Other games have done away with the stamina thing so im not buying the whole can't be taken away."", 'tedious game, finding what you need to upgrade takes for ever, lower levels are easy but the next levels are almost impossible, many levels up and still can only make first tier weapons and armor, and I have issues with the energy level, You use it to often and spend a lot of time waiting for it to recharge', ""Hands down the best survival game I have played. Game is easy to learn and as close to free to play as these types of games can be. Spending only required to make things easier, but definitely not needed. I contacted support and although they responded very quickly, it seemed that didn't want to check the logs and fix the issue"", ""Bit hooked on this game. Although, may be better if weapons were a slight bit easier to come by as getting killed is tough to avoid and if I want to get further in the game, that needs to be the thing. Going stealth doesnt hide me at all and trying to beat the zombies is hard if I can't do damage when I'm close to an item. Also, trees, concrete, berries etc should regenerate at shelter."", 'FIRST: I want to see the movie based on this game! BUT: Beta/buggy. Game crashes, and it gets worse the higher the level for some reason. Have to keep restarting the game. Game balance is ridiculous regarding weapons and armor, repair, etc... Give us our empty canteens back!!! Make it more accessible to repair and UPGRADE our weapons and armor, using our resources. Rare tool kits is ridiculous! Game is conceptually awesome! Graphics very detailed. ART! Hope devs keep fixing!', 'I really am addicted to this game...however....watching videos for rewards and ""triad keys"" comes with a 50 percent chance that the video doesn\'t finish and im disconnected from the game. Then have to restart...etc....and try to watch the ad a second time to receive my prize. Sometimes the game just doesn\'t respond and once again the game stops ...kicks me off...etc. please fix this!!!', 'Awesome survival game. Even though its flatout the exact as its competition. I prefer the graphics and controls much better here. the only thing missing is a companion. Where is my puppy/wolf/ dog/bird/cat ? No companion no 5 star rating. No cash from me. Going back to the competition until a companion is added', ""Updating my review and deleting this game. Storm fall is a survival game like this. Same design but a mid evil feel. That game, your character does not go hungry or thirsty while just standing or moving around for less than a minute. Fix the hunger meter in this game. It's too fast. I used to like this game but it's very unforgiving, weapons break easily, and the hunger/ thirsty meter runs out too quickly. I gave it 2 stars for graphics. That's about the only cool thing about this game."", ""Good game.. but some necessary fixes and balances required. Understand its survival gam3 and its challenging but the boss hp going back to full health while exiting zone for self healing makes annoying and extra hard. Please kindly make that the boss's hp dsnt refill. 5 stars for that balance.. rest gameplay everything is Good as ever. Thankyou for the help. Much Appreciated"", ""This is a nice game but after few minutes of playing it lags a lot . It lags so much that i have to switch off the game and please for God sake keep this game simple. After a player dies please don't vanish it's loot because it's not a real life it's a game. So please keep it as a game . It's my humble request . Please fix these two things"", 'Graphics are wonderful and the controls are simple and easy to learn. The walk through is pretty basic but the storyline is awesome. I like the characters and the ability to get everything you need to craft and build although it isnt too easy. Its enough to keep you entertained and to keep you coming back each day as there are great daily rewards that you can use right away. The packs are decently priced though I havent made any purchases. Still new to this type of game but I enjoy it.', 'This game fresh asf, honestly I played alot of survival games like ""Last Day On Earth"" and I loved it it WAS fun but it got really boring fast. This game has a lot more going on , an interesting storyline, amazing weapon display etc,0 but the best thing of all I don\'t have to go in my backpack to switch my weapon!U can switch weapon\'s at the heat of the moment, AND switch bandages to throwing items instantly! And it\'s barley for months in and already has so much more then other survival games!', 'So far i think its a very nice game. I just started so im very new to it and im getting to learn the mechanics which right now seem a little bit much but it is well put together. This could be a console game. Imma keep at it because it has pulled me in to see what more it has to offer.', ""I can't even begin to go into detail here about how awesome this game is. If you're a fan of the survival genres this is literally perfect for you. Mainly because everything that you can buy in the game, you can literally get in the game. Don't die in the same place twice. I made that mistake and lost a lot of good loot. I bought. Thankfully after contacting the developers. I received that stuff back. This game has has an awesome future and I can't wait to see what they do next."", ""When I first installed this game, I quit playing after an hour. I was frustrated about the constantly drinking and eating so I gave it one star and uninstalled. I gave it another chance because I liked the gameplay and story but was still frustrated about said complaint but slowly kept at. The devs were right when they replied to my previous comment that if I give it time everything will come together smoothly. The more I invest time into this game the better this game gets. Don't rush it."", 'I got addicted, quick. It\'s fun. Couple drawbacks for ftp. Important things are hard to acquire, the daily quests get monotonous with less important rewards the higher your level. This game reminds me of ""Vegas"" cuz you CAN lose yo azz in a moment...lol 😜 Still worth playing and I\'m headed there, now. 😉', ""The Game isn't Bad good graphics and you can get just about everything in game without purchase but you lose your gear way too easy and have to constantly rebuild just to gain the stuff back gets rather annoying and makes you want to stop playing.. there needs to be a pause button in case u need to do something else and don't get attacked while just standing, than lose everything ... Spend hours just to make a weapon and lose it all just to have to redo it all over .."", 'Good game, good graphic, and share inventory in safe house. The cons are: - use too many resource for upgrade/build (made to do framfreek) - use too many resource for repair/maintain item (must un equip good wep/armour eyery time or going nake to do farming) - extreem repititive farming in same location(green location) for basic resoucre like wood/scrap - red zone/event is armour/wep check (made to framing) Summary for my opinion: game is not hard nor challenge, but it lean to heavily farming.', ""Love this game but I dont see the resources I need unless it's in a terroir that I cant go in bc my weapons are too weak. I spent money to get good guns but lost them bc I went somewhere I didnt know I would be killed and I lost everything when I went back to get my things I died again and went back and all my things i paid for the first time was gone and the things I had the second time was there.... like really.

It still has never fixed most of the real problems, waaaaay too many ads, (that's because they just use it to make money) also this game is an accurate representation of the rich vs the poor, when you're small you can try to get big but there's no real way to get big without the Giants eating you, only if they help you get big, but they never do."", 'Great game, but it needs some ballanceing changes. I have played this game for a longtime, and I love it. The problem I have is that when you spawn in, you have a good chance of immediately being eaten by a big cell. This makes the game almost impossible to play when you first start out. In my opinion, this game should adopt s system similar to the new florr.io, where after you are a certain score you have to move to a more challenging part of the map. This way small cells can grow easier.', 'I remember playing this years ago. I loved being able to cruise around, get bigger, and gobble up the occasional competitor. Now it\'s a frustrating unenjoyable teamster fest. I saw someone say the average player last 20 seconds to one minute. My last two rounds I lasted 9s and 20s. The game can get laggy. This can lead to even earlier death. The ""burst"" level kept showing waiting players go up and down, but often would never start an actual game. Insufferable. Hats off to old agar.io. RIP', ""This game is really fun, but when you would play the game normally you would get killed by teamers. It's a fun game not gonna lie but the playerbase isn't that good. Teaming is a problem for me. When i would reach number 1 people would team up on me and keep trying to kill me. I don't know why they team. I can get to #1 without having a partner to help me. Again, it's fun though."", ""It's fine but when I played it the first time it was great then someone killed me, so I started over and it was glitching so 😧😔😫 that when I tried the 3rd time I barely couldn't move and when I did someone would pop out of no where or a glitch would happen and i'd die right away. Nice game but fix that lil problem. (Tʖ̯T)"", ""I had great fun playing this while I was in school, and still do! But the amount of ads alone is turning me away, also the money that you can't earn but have to buy is a big turn off, I wanna make my own skin but can't because of it. All in all, a rather mediocre experience."", 'Good game, kind of laggy and you should be able to spawn away from a whole ton of players because I keep getting spawn killed. but I love the fact you can get skins and make your own characters and usernames. Going with other reviews, I think it would be a good idea to have an online or against AI mode.', ""This game is really frustrating but so much fun, I love it!! Would it be possible for you to slightly increase your starting size when you go up a level? If that was the case I'd be completely addicted. I know that you increase in size when your bubbles slowly go up one point at a time to a specific point ie 20, 50. Unfortunately only 1 of your collection usually goes up so it takes forever, so annoying!! This is the 1 issue with the game but it's a big 1 I'm afraid so had to remove 2 stars."", ""This makes absolutely no sense: there isn't even a tutorial. I have no clue how to split, and I have no clue what the 'rush' game mode even is. The mobile controls are also very bad.

I want there to be a tutorial so some people actually know how to play and I want the controls fixed."", ""It's an awesome game really, I would love to give u a 5 star. But you need to chill on the ads. It's too much. Everytime an ad comes on its 20 seconds long and after the ads done theres another 5 seconds like why? Anddd the macro needs to be a faster. Anyone can make it go that fast if they sonic threw the button."", ""Honestly it's garbage. Filled with ads, game glitches out from time to time, and overall the players are just toxic. You can't get into a single lobby without having players teaming up and taking over the match. You basically will die no matter what unless you team up and even then, it's just not fun. It would be better if there was no teaming."", ""It was horrible because on this game 1 problem is you need to spend like 99$ for only a thousands of these kind of things you can spend stuff on. And number 2 is why I really rated a 1 and if I could rate a 0 I would right away. And number two is that even though you don't know when you want to create your own agar YOU NEED TO BUY IT WITH YOUR ORANGE YELLOW THING!

On top of everything else the skins do not look that good. Some are just over priced and I think it is a unworthy attempt of making little to no money on things that are In significant to the game, the service can be dominated to easily by players. Theres few and far between opportunities to make it in this game. Lastly The actions and movements are always delayed unless you have top notch Wi-Fi. I', ""Isn't the whole reason behind this game to get bigger... Then tell me how small circles can take out big circles in a game designed for the big circles to take out the small ones. The game devs should at least step up and stop people from using assists and cheats. Then id give it a 5 like i did with PUBG Mobile👍 I get its an old game, and that most of the players are AI but that doesnt excuse the fact that their providing a game service with no intent on making it enjoyable. Its not that hard"", ""Can you give me a break and let me play the game for 30 seconds without hitting me in the face with ads and microtransaction deals? If you don't manage to survive too long, its an awful experience with all the ads. The game is the same as the web version, but controls on small devices is weird and there is an obvious input delay. New players should have immunity to getting eaten until you move because of the delay until you can actually do anything once you get into a game."", ""I only rated it 1 star because you can't rate it 0 star. It doesn't even work. You move it forward and it just stays there for 20 seconds till it constantly moves, doesn't and can't change any direction and then you get killed by a ball. You can't even start the game for you start it, your ball freezes and another ball kills you. That's how bad this game is. You can't even find where the country flag balls are.

I was steadily killed by the same people over and over. It is a little unfair that these people get so huge that you cant get a fair start.

Would Not Recommend.Of course this game wants you to waste your money for good thing, To many peoples names are ""Team?"" Or ""RIP KOBE 😭"" Those names are just stupid.

I wish everyone spawned the same size, some people like me who recently downloaded start teeny tiny and some people take up half the map! If everyone started the same size it would be fair, because now if you are even a tiny bit small then someone will easily kill you from 4 sides. People can kill me so easily and I just hate it, it sucks. One of the worst games every, and i downloaded it only because i really liked other io. games. THIS IS A REALLY BAD GAME DONT DOWNLOAD!']"

No fun to die in a few seconds from meta weapons and bots. Win or lose it sucks either way. Lose and have a top spot on your team or win and be one of the bottom performers on your team. Either way you don't win gold and keys... Don't even ask me about the chest rates. Thanks for the silver, power cells, and gold..."", ""I'm not a bot or a paid employee. This is a real evaluation. This game is older but still fun. Absolutely its pay to win as you get higher in levels [if you really care about winning]. I had a blast until I reached lvl 25. Now as my TIER group goes up I dont stand a chance.....at all. The weapons you CAN afford through in game currency are ok to start, upgrading is essential but the cost is way to high. But by then the p2w guys already have the best stuff."", ""Really like this game, hopefully they will keep adding more varieties of Robots, better weapons, and ways of getting in game bucks easier. Also there was a glitch in the game usually near the end of the match a couple of my bots froze up, the controls don't respond at all your bot just sits there getting attacked by the other players. And you can't do anything. Happened 3 to 4 times now. Please fix this bug. Ty Great overall game. One more thing. Please add about 10 or 20 new maps. Ty"", ""3 stars. Best mech fighting game I've come across for my android device, in saying that however, there are issues you should know first. 1. Lots of pay-to-win in this game, not just cosmetics. So you will face really good geared people. 2. Game stability is honestly the worst, and on a samsung. Game crashes just about every other match. It may freeze before, during or after watching an ad. Sometimes it just crashes on its own, especially during a battle. 3. Tech support garbage."", ""It's still fun. If you want to play for free your not gonna like it. Game is built to aggravate you to buy expensive robots and weapons. Then you have to upgrade them. Takes a ton of resources you also have to buy to stay competitive. Then they added pilots. Pilots are also expensive to upgrade. Now you have to upgrade your Titan. And that is expensive to upgrade too. Might as well buy a real gaming system for the amount of money you will end up spending.🖕"", 'I like this game. The main issue I have with it is that instead of buffing older robots to make them even the slightest bit useful. They sell you a pilot\'l, that after spending thousands in gold to level, will ""upgrade"" the older bot to make it useful again. This is my biggest complaint. You can be pay to win all day I don\'t care. But pay to patch is inane.', 'Great game but it lacks a voice chat so you can strategize with your team. The game is a chaotic, but still fun. Please reduce the time you need to wait to create the big robots that need pieces. The lack of a voice chat really hurts specially in the games that you play with random people. Please make any form of communication, the game will be so much better.', ""Been playing this game about 2 + years. All in all it's a fun game to play. Skirmish is fun to check out bots and weapons. But the advancement is tough as you climb the ranks. The win lose ratio isn't very good. Match up for leagues need more work. If you want to advance towards the top plan on spending big bucks. All in all its a fun game."", ""The game is well and truly fun. A little grindy, especially when you unlock the workshop. However, it lost something. As I started to get higher in the ranks, my game began to crash more and more often. It's nigh unplayable now with how often it crashes. I think it's my older phone not liking 6 v 6. To many particle effects. Still causes me to loose it when game crashes mid match or at the beginning of a match."", ""It's a cool game but when it comes to buying tokens to buy boxes or gold coins to buy chines envelopes it does not give what it should give you. For example instead of hoping to get a very good weapon for your robot either from the boxes or the envelopes it give you puzzles to reach that weapon or silver or gold bricks when you could battle for them. You buy but it doesn't give you what it should be giving you."", ""This is a good game.. i am not a money spender and i could keep up with the other player just by using ads.. but i can't understand about the matching system.. i am a silver player and i was matched with a gold player 6 lv higher than me.. please fix your matching system especially between lv 30+ and under 30.. there is no way we can win when they have a titan while we don't"", ""This is a great game, it's just that it's become more pay to win. It's hard to compete in high leagues. It's still a great game though. It has a tutorial, controls are easy to pick up, has a huge variety of robots, it's just that you can't use old robots or non-meta and have a chance. Early 2017 was the golden era. If it reverts to something similar, I'll 5 stars. I'll still play because of memories and because it's still fun, just needs major improvements."", ""I've been playing for around 3 years now, and had 5 good strong bots, + used to have fun playing! This has all changed though! Now big spenders can buy a robot that can immobilise the opponent, blast them to smithereens, while being invincible themselves! Its impossible for me to be competitive now! These super powerful bots should be in a totally different league! Now I'm just cannon fodder for the guys with the money! No chance of fair battle anymore! Thanks Pixonic morons Ruined a great game"", ""I've played this game since 2015, was a addictive game that I instantly got hooked too. But now, its just gone. All of that fun, gone, instead has transformed into a big disappointment. Wr has to brighten up and take a step into the community and see their problems. I have become extremely dissatisfied of this game now and sad too, I also became inactive. This isn't the Wr I remember. Now it's difficult even for new players. If Pixonic your reading this, I just wanna say... Good Luck."", 'I had been tens of thousands of dollars into this game and now they want to introduced more currency and different abilities and weapons, this just ruin the game for me so i stopped playing it.

This is with 40-50+ chests being open. Throw me a bone man!!!!', ""Awesome game... EXCEPT IT'S A PAY TO WIN GAME! It's virtual merchandise, not like it takes titanium to make a titan or anything of the sort. I believe of course, the devs should indeed make a living too & I have spent a share on this no doubt. Now, the old school vets already have an advantage, which is cool they deserve it. My point, make it affordable for everyone & everyone will buy, then it becomes a challenge of players not dollars."", 'This game was once a really good game with the coming of new items to a point were the game became a pay to win strategy game their isnt much point in even playing unless your dedicated and patient also recently my game has just commited death xD it keep crashing when ever i get into a match dont take my advise as granted it is a great game (this is my personal experience) i do recomend this game to people who enjoy strategy multiplayer games.', ""Nerf stealth ability durations by 150%. Take out flying robots except Hover. Nerf Titan charging by 150% or to 4 kills or take them out completely. Stop my game from crashing and lagging 24/7. I NEVER SHOULD HAVE COME BACK TO THIS MELTDOWN!!!!!! I loved this game back in its prime. No lag or crashes. No overpowered weapons (except for double orkan/pinata on the Griffin). No Titans that control the outcome of every match. Please fix this. I'm still going to play but the community demands changes."", ""Good game.......mostly. It keeps freezing up at the battle begins screen. You can hear the game progressing but, the screen is stuck in the lobby. Tried it again. Fun to play but, the fun is diminished by the lag, the freeze ups, the disconnects and all the ads trying to get money (which I don't have). Uninstalling. I won't install again."", 'I started playing this game in 2014 shortly after its release, and was a dedicated loyal player up untill around 6 months ago. This game has become overwhelmingly difficult to obtain resourses needed for leveling up equipment. Still enjoyable to play but i no longer feel the need to keep up with the high level players due to the time and money needed to compete. I simply cannot keep putting effort to a lost cause. I have even deleted the game entirely for months at a time.', ""The game play is excellent. I only regret not being able to save my first account when I switched phones. I lost nearly 400 dollars invested. I tried contacting them to see if I could redeem what I lost if only just my clan (Syndicate of War)but no dice. I'm on my second account and I'm loving it."", 'This game is already extremely pay-to-win. I always lose because of people that paid to have the best stuff. But there\'s two other things I\'ve come to really hate. One, the ""random crates?"" NEVER give me anything other than extremely low silver rewards. Over and over. The other thing I hate? Titans. If you have to be lvl 30 to even HAVE a Titan, don\'t put me (lvl 23) in a game where MULTIPLE ENEMIES have Titans. It\'s completely unfair and unbalanced.', 'App keeps crashing on me.No longer good for android. I up dated and it glitches so bad I can bearly see to play the game. Sux now. If there was an option for no star. That is what I would choose. Fix the update guys. UPDATE The app now freezes up on my android. Still glitching. Maybe the admin could help. I want to get back to 5 stars. TY', 'This is a fun game, however the game is an extreme grind unless you have the money to play pay to win style. The developers do not block acces to any features but but it so hard to win a game unless you have invested some cash, this is normal for most games that are pay to win, but with war robots it is particularly difficult earn gold and gold is hard earned. Another con if you want to upgrade anything you can only upgrade 1 thing at a time and with long waiting times', 'It is a very good game, have spent some money on it, but why is it so laggy now, i just turn my turret and it lags, a mech gets destroyed, it lags, anybody spawns in, it lags, and it randomly crashes, so if you have all of your boosters on and have enough time for one more game, it will crash and you will lose the boosters.', ""I'm revising my review I love this I don't know if it's hackers or if their server is s***. but every time you play this game and get into a good run all of a sudden here comes the crashes. And it's always at the most opportune moment for you. Especially when you're winning. That's why I feel it's a hack. Please game people's fix this it's getting worse and worse."", ""A very enjoyable and addictive game. However, the game is just money grab. You buy and upgrade mech, only for the developers to nerf everything you've bough and worked for. They DO NOT listen to their playerbase and WR community. If you stick to this game, you'll realize soon how upsetting and sick this game is. p.s. buff Orkans"", 'The game is too expensive to buy anything. The chests only give the bottom prize 99% of the time. The matchmaking is terrible and puts you with players nowhere near your abilities and far above and beyond your level. The bots have become Tanky since the introduction of the even bigger tanky Titans. The reward system is cheap and makes you have to play for way too long to earn enough for anything beyond the noob level. See a lot of new reviewers here that havent played long enough to know better.', ""At first, I loved playing this game. Now you are doomed to never growing unless you pay a lot of money. I'm talking $50-$100 for one robot that will be obsolete in a month. I don't mind spending a dollar here and there, but to play this game and have the options I would desire, I would easily have to spend hundreds of dollars on this game. Greedy developers are making it not worth it."", 'The game is great however if you pay money for keys 15 chests I opened only two spots were available for silver and I happen to land on that 15 times. If any people from the game see this i feel cheated honestly it would be nice if you would make that right. $10 on a video game is what i call a special occasion. Or could have been', ""An awesome & incredibly fun, albeit expensive, game! My newer Android tablet was getting booted off the application every time that I tried to play the game after it's most recent version update. The application's help pages only stated that this problem was most likely due to one's internet connection or their device's memory. It does not mention one's processor not being fast enough or powerful enough to handle the application's data stream unfortunately, as I found to be my case."", ""It's a outstanding game and I highly recommend it one thing i did find is that when u get to a really high level like level 23 then it takes forever to level up. This game is outstanding the way it is, but in my opinion it would be even better if that was ajusted. Thanks for all your hard work and frequent updates."", ""Love this game. Would gave 5 stars if I could send friend request directly to folks I know not on social media. Maybe play via local wifi or something. Other issue beyond the pay to play match-up wait time. No other plays you can't play. My son and I waited 45 mins no match-up. 2nd oldest son jumps on, in game play quickly. Mind you both recently started. I been play for a week or two. Another I lost 2 Attack boosters due to this. That shouldn't be since no match-up ever happened."", ""It's a pay to win game with alot of cheaters and murders. All the real good weapons and robots you HAVE to buy to obtain. They say you can get them by just playing but that's BS. They give 100 components out of 10k to random robots you dont care about nor want. And the price for some of those robots are like $100+ gtfo. Plus the weapons are another $100+ each weapon. Then you need millions and millions of silver to level them up. It would take someone years of nonstop playing to get good robots."", 'This game, like many other online games are Heavily Dependent on how much money you can spend to buy necessary weapons and Robots. If you are the type who likes to spend hundreds of dollars to get stronger, this us the right game for you. If you are NOT into spending a ridiculous amount of money, then this is probably not the game for you.', 'The game itself is actually great but the deals is spams in my face when I log in are really annoying and the fact the game is mostly based in ""pay to win"" is sad. Most matches I play have players who are just way to high of a level for me to play with. Also remove Titans from FFA please. Overall great game just limit the ""pay to win"" vibe.', ""Too many cheaters, !. I've played this game since Oct. 2018 and really enjoy it, however cheaters take control of your movement's so you freeze just when your taking out a bot then the other team kills your bot. It is happening more and more to where I don't spend money on the game any more."", 'Good game just sucks that you have to pay for the high-endrobots and weapons using gold which you have to purchase more than likely because it takes forever to accumulate 10k puzzle pieces per high-end weapon or robot if you want them sooner. Beware of black market key purchasing in hopes of getting a high end robot or weapon! A waste of money! Per 1000 keys opening 10 100 key black market chest 95% chance you get 6/10 100k silver 1 200k silver and 3 30 gold prizes! What a rip off!!!!!!!!!', ""Immersive. Lotsa boom! Great gameplay. I don't care what they say about targeting algorithms based on your spending/not spending habits...I do, but, gameplay overrides common sense... And the Titans are okay.

It's smooth and easy to play! Of course you can buy stuff with real cash but you don't have too! I haven't spent a dime and have some great high tier weapons!! Have only played multiplayer so far but had a great experience! Will definitely be continuing to play!!! If you looking to see if this is for you or now I highly recommend downloading it a giving it a try!"", ""Great game! I really love how smooth the multiplayer mode is! It's deadly addictive. And my favorite part is that THIS GAME IS NOT PAY TO WIN. Even though I have bought the premium pass, you can earn gun skins, bag skins, vehicle skins just by progressing in the game! And the battle royale mode is just really, really creative. I just love the option of skill classes. It makes the game even more interesting to play. So I advise you to download this game. It's just too fun to play."", ""Anybody else having problems with season 3? Very good graphics. One of the best game I've ever played. Unfortunately after season 2 I noticed that the game keeps freezing and lagging and crashing. Also, eventhough I have full service or full reception on my phone, is not letting me play. I go into a multiplayer game and it seems like it will start and then all of the players disappear. I know is not my phone or internet. To top it off, the creators dont seem to care about our opinions."", ""Laggy as all balls and with the amount of people that play this game, why are we still getting bots on the team? If I could give this zero or even negative stars, I would. I'm 100% glad I didn't spend the $60+ dollars you charge for the console versions because this is, just like the console games, absolutely trash. Trash game by a trash company. But. Here it sits above 3 stars cause your fan base of teenagers are easy to please."", 'The game is awesome but a waste of data! Everytime I download this game and make it to level 40 or above the game crashes and it is frustrating. I am grateful I have not spent any money on it as it would be a waste as well. I am not the only one with this experience. I also notice Cyber bugs and hackers are either coming in from social links or from the developers. So if I could rate this game a negative 5 stars I would. It is a big let down, especially after investing many wasted hours too.', ""Well, I never played this game in all the years ps was out, my son had it, and played all the time. But I figured I would try it. On mobile it's fun, exciting and I just can't put it down most the time. It plays smoothly , but I am on WiFi constantly in my house, but when iam on reg. Data it runs smooth as well, graphics r nice. There should be more mobile games just like this.."", 'A very beginner friendly game in my opinion as I consider myself a newbie to the world of FPS gaming. This game encourages me to deep dive directly into this Melee combat and gun-shooting experience in ways that I find extremely engaging and embracing. I had given up many times in the past trying to play FPS games, but something about this one just never let me give a second thought about playing it or not. Yes, COD mobile was my introduction to the world of FPS. Thank you Activision !!!!🤗', ""I'm actually super impressed. It really is the next best thing to playing on the console! I see a lot of reviews about it lagging and glitching...just so you know, it really helps if you go into your settings and turn down the resolution. It still looks great and helps a bit...it also doesn't suck as much battery life and it keeps your phone from getting hot. Clearing the cache intermittently also helps!"", ""Great looking game but it crashes all the time, especially in Battle Royale mode. It seems to be widespread across quite a variety of phones so it's a developer issue. Black screen in the middle of a game with sound or just crash straight out. Thankfully I don't spend money in these games and I'd advise people not to bother putting money into it until it's more stable."", ""I freaking love this game. The best mobile game I've ever played! I love how they are always updating and adding new modes to the multiplayer and now battle royal. The only reason why my rating isnt a 5 star is because for the last couple weeks my game has been freezing and then crashing, seems to only be in battle royal which is super frustrating because that's the main mode I play. Please fix these bugs and I'll give you the 5 star you deserve!!"", ""All in all fantastic game but since the last update it kicks out during on-going matches. This is really frustrating when you are playing ranked matches . I guess I made a mistake linking it to a COD account. Please fix this. I have been playing this since the day it was launched and trust me, I play it all night long. Better sort out the glitches or I'll take 5 stars back ;)"", 'Great game if you love the original xbox versions. Old maps were brought back, and it is pretty impressive that this could be made for phones. One flaw is that zombies is a bit easy, and I was able to complete a hardcore raid with just me and another player. Other then that, I love this game and it deserves a 5 star rating and a good review because what the developers did to create this game', ""It's just Call of Duty, but for your phone/tablet/whatever. If your thing can run it, yea get it, otherwise just get it on your ps3/xbox/toaster/whatever. Theres pubg, nuketown, and zombies on here too, gotta love the classics. On a scale from 1 to EVEN!, I CAN'T EVEN! Try it guys, it's fun, and you can play it anywhere, just gotta get used to the controls"", ""I don't know why there's so many people complaining. The game is amazing. The ONLY issue I have is I can't seem to get the sensitivity right if I use a controller. Very irritating actually. I do very VERY well just using my fingers but I think I could do incredible with the controller. Please do a structured sensitivity like how you have it on consoles PLEASE. If you ever do it'll definitely be a 5* review. If not, I'll keep playing like I do and kicking arse."", ""Amazing game, didn't expect much since it's on mobile. But I am truly impressed. The graphics are like Advanced Warfare, the have maps from all kinds of COD games, and you have to earn Scouts or Players. You dont just get everything off the bat. I would love, however, a Capmaign mode or a private match mode. The Campaign would add alot of stuff to the game. Granted it would require a bit of phone memory but it would be worth it IMO!"", ""Don't get me wrong. This is a great game and all, but its far from perfect. There are lots and i mean there are LOTS of players on here that clearly use Emulators to play the game on pc with a keyboard and mouse so they have a huge advantage. Wish they could keep the pc players and mobile players sepreate like they do on PUBG Mobile. Oh and if you do decide to give the game a whirl, STAY OUT OF THE TEXT CHAT! It is highly cancerous and is a perfect example why the cod community is that way."", ""The game constantly gets me out of the current game like I had no internet connection, but I still have my mobile data on, this is really annoying because that's been like that several times now and I've been winning the game, drives me crazy the fact to start over a new game please fix that ... The game is great overall but that's the only thing that gets me mad"", ""Love the game, DESPISE the glitches! About 10+ times a day (seriously) the screen will randomly go black, which then freezes my phone & results in me having to restart the app. Also, the voice chat cuts out during matches & you can't hear your team, & they can't hear you speak; the only way to resolve this is to restart the app. The game continuously freezes & lags as well. The amount of cheaters in this game is astronomical & the developers need to start banning people, because it's ridiculous."", 'Game is fun to play but brings the phrase ""pay to win"" to a new level. The chances to win upgrades are extremely low so save your money and just take what you\'re given..you will do fine. Over the course of several months I\'ve sunk in a little money and have yet to get a major upgrade, mostly just useless ""C"" points.', 'Good implementation of the overall concept of the game, great graphics and updates. Almost like playing on a Playstation or Xbox. Some room for improvements such as location of some of the controllers and lacks of better instructions/ tutorials on where to find what (it took me a while before learning how change guns while on game). Cudos for such a great job!', ""I commented on this back in January and yet still having server issues, game locks up or screen goes black!! When you have to reconnect you lose ability to see team members or even enemies. I am tired of being in a game and having it continuously glitch. Sometimes it doesn't let me see trigger buttons after reconnecting. I have updated game, reset phone and checked internet connection and rest modem and yet it still does it.. Frustrated as hell!!!!"", ""Terrible game play,don't know what the problem is but am about to delete because of glitching issues and not just sometimes but all of the time.you get bumped off and receive a penalty for leaving the game play. Also when moving it keeps sending you back where you started, and when making it a little further it will glitch you into a whole other place on the map and then connection is lost...this is very frustrating and I'm going to lower my rating. Sorry but 2 is all it's worth considering"", '""Best mobile game ever"", thats what i said when i first tried it. Not anymore though, as the game has now been glitching alot, freezing and worse of all, the screen turning black in the middle of a match. I play BR alot, was currently lvl Legendary and i dropped down to master 5 cause of that. Every game the screen turn black just out of no where and I absolutely hate it. Guess im gonna have to go back to pubg.', ""Non stop tutorial. I'm 10 min in and instill can't exit the tutorial to set up my controller.... Give a option to skip. Or once the tutorial is done let it be done. Multiplayer then another 10 min of BS how to equip, how to upgrade, how to earn battle pass, how to .... And at the end of it all, my Steel series controller that works on all my other games doesn't work. I don't recommend this game at all."", ""I have been playing Call of Duty Mobile since Season 1. I've bought every gamepass, and they are all awesome, filled with awesome gear and guns. Battle Royale is fun to do. You can do short film movies in a Private Battle Royale map. Zombies is really good. But when you make the special zombie called Brutus mad he runs at you at high speed. So that might need a fix. Settings and controls are adjustable to your liking. Ranked points are hard to get. That was my experience from Season 1 to now. 👍"", ""Hey, TENCENT you are excellent, great and I loved this game. It has a lots of modes so if I'm bored of from any single mode there are other modes for my enjoyment. The updates are making the game to reach on a higher level. Earlier there were bugs in the game but there are none of them. You're GREAT....GREAT AND....GREAT. Keep it up Tencent."", 'This game is ripping me off. I spent alot of money and tiered up more than 100 times and opened multiple purple cases and even when I buy 10 cases at a time they keep giving me duplicates. To me it seems like a total rip off. You can look at my account and see I spent alot of money. Something should really be done about duplicates. I also notice that no one else is having any luck with getting the cool weapons on crates, so it only tells me that this game has already generated tons of money.', ""Possibly the worst mobile port of one of the best FPS ever. The battle royale is infested with more bugs than a third world country hospital bed. The game reconnects inbetween the game and sometimes you don't even get the luxury of re-opening the game and continue your multiplayer ranked match thus resulting in penalty points. I have to restart the game after every match just to make sure I don't get demoted to a lower tier. Fix your damn game. Uninstalled"", ""This used to be my favorite mobile game, but now it's plagued with hackers and it's impossible to rank up because the game creators refuse to fix the game. I've spent over 2 weeks trying to get from master 1 to master 2 for the AK, but it's impossible to level up unless you have mods or modders on your team. I wish I'd never spent money on this game, just a waste of time and hard earned cash."", ""The game has great graphics and eazy to learn and play, but to bad it just doesn't have a good connection it has alot of bugs, it was working perfect first season, but second season its bad connections, freezes, lags, and I get kick out of games in the middle of playing. If it weren't for that it would be a great game."", ""Awesome game with awesome graphics. But few problems to be fixed. Please don't add us into matches in which players have left. We are always on the losing side and half of the match is already over. Another thing, I am just sick of bots. For match making, you guys put 2 to 3 bots in our teams making it difficult to win. I even remember the names of few bots now. The bots are useless and just concede kills. Please fix this. Otherwise it is good."", ""This game is great. I love all the activities you can do to get tiers, extremely rare guns and avatars. But since the new update playing Battle royals the app would crash. I would still hear the action going on but can't play because the screen would be black. Doesn't happen to multiplayer mode or Zombie. Please fix. Was a 5 star but now 4 because of the app crashes."", 'Season 3 upgrade crashes a lot. Video freezes/repeats video frames often, but audio continues to play. Also, despite having 100+ Gb internet connect, there is a big time lag. Instead of fixing it, the lag is getting worse every day. Wish there was a zero rating. Between the hackers/cheats and technical issues, the fun is all but gone.', 'Awesome game! So much fun. Unfortunately this application freezes/spasms/crashes 75% of the time during gameplay, and usually right when I get into a fire fight. My phone is a Galaxy Note 10+. 12Gb of OS ram, 256 Gb of storage, is set to run full CPU with high performance, and the COD Mobile app is saved on an almost empty 200ishGb external SD card. Not sure what the problem is. If Activision has tech support (cyber professional myself) for troubleshooting, please advise. =] Thanks.', ""For years I've been a passive gamer and mostly tried to avoid PVP whenever possible. During any multiplayer games I'd stick to just PVE, but since a friend of mine recommended this game to me, I've been blasting! It's like the dormant PVP gamer within me came out today, and for the first time ever... I actually led my teams kill count! Plus this game looks pretty good, I'm one for graphics and I'm honestly impressed by this games visuals!"", ""Super fun game..... when it works.. It freezes every BR match and I have to back out of the game and try to get back in before someone kills me... which never works. MP matches work about half the time and I know I'm not the only person with this problem. Just read more of these comments.... not playing until this gets fix which seems like is not happening anytime soon.. If it gets fixed 5 star forsure."", ""My primary issue right now is the paywall that still exists for players like me who are F2P. For example, in this current season, the Tier 50 reward is an XPR (sniper rifle) with the Geometry appearance modification. HOWEVER, this is only available for Battle Pass subscribers. People who play for free should have something worth earning if they're willing to play their way to a Tier 50+ position, rather than earn credits, EXP cards and seasonal daily crates. Otherwise this is better than console"", 'Well for a Game that just got out and beat PUBG immediately is something. So far you need a good network connection, even though local network is good the game server sometimes cut out. I noticed some shots through trucks, metal and concrete, while under cover. I also noticed some hackers where three shot at you kills instantly even with armour and full health. Amazing graphics, and speed of play. Great work developer, appreciate the continuous improvement on the bugs, hackers and reports.', 'In the beta test period, the character had so many radio communications like when you killed an enemy, the character said ""Enemy down"" or ""Tango down"". This feature is absent in the present version. It\'s not a big deal, but small things like this matters a lot. Please see to this small problem and please add more voice announcers to the game.', ""Super glitchy after update. Crashes and being kicked from the match constantly. Love the game. It's well made and feels like cod. But the experiences in game are always the problem. At first it was great but now the hacks are getting to be in allot of games. Aim bots and wall hacks are in a large amount of games in death match. And the lag can make some games almost unplayable when in a Latin American lobby.""]"

                  **PROVIDE YOUR PRECIOUS FEEDBACK**","['Sorry but It was one of the worst things i have ever played. The enemies bullets passes through every thing exept rocks. Most of the controls didnt work after 5 levels And its not smooth. Its slow. And the walking control is too small for such a game. I think it can be a verry good game. But it realy neds to be better. I hope everything that went wrong for me is just because of my phone.', ""This game is very nice I love it but the pictures of human being and seen are bad. So I request you that if you make another version of this game don't do this mistake again and next time I think there should be car action's also. Thank you I am having great fun with this game. To play this game in better way we should use all the controls of this game and always use sniper also for longer distance and if we play by hiding and running it is more better. Good luck to other players."", 'The game idea was so nice. But there should be a option to change the view angle. So i have give it 4 stars. There are so much levels!! Above 1k! It is very strange!! Its a good game, very good for those who like action games, but I thought I would go into a big war.#', 'This is a better shooting game for now. I would have given it 5 stars but most of the seen is always at 1 place. There should be different places to attack the enemy and also it can in a mission form where u go and kill some people and u will be paid for it. Still very enjoyable.', 'I ""ACTUALLY"" consider this game to be a GREAT GAME! ESPECIALLY, compared to most other games with a similar or exact same objective. I think it can use some little tweaks here & there, which is something that CAN & WILL ALWAYS be said/requested to be made possible as nothing is perfect and everything can always be improved in a way. But the game rn, I personally consider it to be an ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL, FUN, CHALLENGING & UTTERLY ADDICTIVE GAME! DONT SEE MYSELF DISCONTINUING PLAY AT ALL!', 'A good game for beginners I think. I played a few games and I beat a few levels. I dont know if its get harder or not . When they shoot at ya its like you take a little damage or no damage at all. I think its too easy ! But hey I could be wrong.', ""Its a good game but i think it should have a story, that way it would be more interesting and the arsenal like i need more mind blowing weapons, and it seems like all the weapons have the same damage... I would have giving five stars but I'll just wait for and upgrade."", ""Amazing,great game but the quality,graphics, and others. Just ain't right so i'll wait for more updates, :-\\ so classic FPS but just fix a little things. Because I saw the picture it was so awesome but I realized it is to low game, :-( that's why fix a little things, Ok. ^_^ and I am sorry that I am like being to harsh."", ""The game is very very bad game which have lots of aids it does not give you to play the game well. The weapons didn't work well this game developer will never get a single paise because it wants more money it ask money from the beginning of the game I would like to tell the developer to see the game gun war, pub g , gunship strike, and many other aids free game which the players giving or rating 5 star thanks for your v very bad game"", ""I would give it 0 stars But it won't let me the game is OK but the advertisements they ruin the whole game Experience or you can't even take them off if you want to take them off they charge you to download an app so that you will not get no advertisements that is a con job you will not enjoy this game because it doesn't let you The countless worthless garbage advertisements make this game suck"", ""Graphic is great and in very small storage it gives amazing experience offline but the only problem is that, after some levels the levels start repeating and starting position is mostly same and one more problem is that some time only 3 to 5,6 opponent comes that's why I give 3 stars"", 'Good controls,but you dont have partners and great missions...overall nice gameplay...but please make the game tough like real war tough battles,being a commander for real,soldiers having your back as a commandor,helicopter rides...and many more war action staff!', 'The game is actually cool and too simple. The missions are the same and I bought all availabke guns within 30minutes of gameplay. And also, what i saw in the screenshots were not in the game... Its different.', ""One of the worst game.. uninstalling now. It's just filled with advertisement nothing else. Developers are so stupid that they think people will keep something in their phone if they keep bombarding with ads. Put in game purchases instead of adds"", 'Its a good game ,very good for those who like action games. I myself like action so I enjoy playing this game but just that advertisments keep on popping up and ruining the whole game', 'I found this game super awesome as it has stunning graphics and the new version has more new things . You only have to work on the controls a little bit only 1% only and your game will be super awesome.', ""Love it 💕. I only have a thing against it's repetition of episodes, other than that the game is awesome."", 'This game was really good at the beginning and i cld rate it 6/5 bt as for now i prefer to give it 3/5,at first the stages were only 30 wthout repeating them, all were different, bt now it has more than 2000 stages and all of them are repetetive', 'FPS commando shooting 3D game is very nice game. And it is action-packed commando shooting game. It is specially designed for shooting""', 'Downloaded the app and there is a constant ad while playing the game. Which i feel is stupid and aggravating. Then i kill 2 enemy mission accomplished and i was rewarded with a full length full size ad. Wooohoooo! No thamks. Deleted.', 'Bad very bad. There is an add after every single stage. The add lasts longer than the stupid stage. Do not waste your time to download this game.', 'I love this app and graphics are awesome. But there are some issues like the story that repeat too much, and I feel boring.', ""At first i looked for the review and the response of others and yeah so many ads and second try to add more mbs to let it look like an open world gaming experience but offline thou. For the rest it's okay to play. Thank you."", 'Please add a customizable HUD and Sensitivity options, other than that this game is addictive. The Graphics are the most satisfying, but I would like to get comfortable with the settings, so please add Sensitivity settings and a customizable HUD', 'The game is good an an impresive game for a fps offline but he graphics are very low and the control is hard and can you ad a reload manual because it will be stressing if you just reload innthe middle of a battle and can you pls put morenweapons like secondaries meelee and shotguns it will be a good game if you do', 'The actual gameplay does not match the images. The graphics are poor, there are no stakes, and the levels are very repetitive.', 'A little hard to understand the controls, no tutorial or run down on what to do, ads a bit annoying, all in all a pretty good game', ""It's OK but the levels are becoming too repetetive, same buildings, same scenery. I've not seen any of what pics are shown in the description here."", ""Wonderful! Very easy to control, graphics is ok but you need to work on the camera, can't view full body in action."", ""I love this game because of it's graphic, it is terrific game and exciting game, you can use it any where without internet connection. Love this app."", '😊Its good,😍 l like the game but l think you have to like make it more adventures 😛like we have to find the enemies 😈and when the game starts it self you are giving guns😤. Make the game more like 😲GARENA FREE FIRE😲 but without squads and duos,😝 only SOLO😁 and offline😆, then you will improve TRUST ME....ťháñķ ýøü !!😊😇', 'This game is good but,something the graphics must be improved and more guns and outfits looks must can be optimised by the players so that the players can change their character and outfits and can also keep zombie modes,and pet system', 'Worst game I ever played, do not download. Graphics are rubbish as well as the controls. There is no reload button you have to run out of bullets before you can reload.', 'A crappy game with TONS of advertising It almost makes the game unplayable. Poor graphics and poor controls. It almost seems that the game was made strictly to show advertisements', ""This is by far the nicest game I've ever played on a mobile phone, nice graphics and I so wish they can improve hiding scene as you still get shot while hiding.."", ""Fpp game mode,better graphics compare to other battleground games with same size.was beyond expectation,A KIND OF PUBG THEME is used,but can't reload, can't alter any controls BUT AT THIS SIZE THIS GAME WORTH DOWNLOADING."", ""This game so amazing, has affordable equipments and the controls are amazingly good. Not for five stars though, it is not that good. Y'all should play this game"", ""The banner ads over the game screen are ridiculous!! I don't mind watching ads for power ups etc.... but this is too much!! The Devs should watch successful games to get a better idea... Uninstalling now"", 'Gaphics can be improved...battle scene becomes boring at it doesnt change regularly. Gun exchange should be imporved one must be able to select prim and sec weapons. Enemy can shoot at you through walls and floors at times.', 'I like the game, but i dont like the idea of having infinite number of levels, i just scrolled more than 2000 levels.WTH.']"

Improved gameplay speed","['I described this game as good,Because is very rare on gameplay then. I really like it, So elegant all the way? #please users of slither.io game update on the latest version of 2019 1.6.2? Quickly want to update now💯💧🐐', ""Much prefer this version to the online version, solely for being able to play against AI. Online gameplay has always been a lag-fest so to get rid of that is great. The only two things I'd love to see added are: • The ability to play vertical. Sometimes I just want to hold my phone upright while playing. • Controller support. Having created a Steam controller scheme for the web-based version, I know this game feels great with a controller. Native support would be great."", 'Great mechanics. Needs updated though, and bots removed. Update suggestions? Statistics; how long do you normally get? How long do you normally play? How many players do you kill? Can I see the leaderboards after I die? Can I keep watching the area after I die? Those are simple suggestions. Sound would be nice. How about random power ups? (Extra speed, invulnerability, half thickness)', ""Game lag is so bad and frequent, that I hari kari the majority of the games so I can restart and hopefully have a smooth no-lag game session. No option to quit active game. I had to uninstall in less than an hour because the lag was severe enough that I couldn't play with any fine control. Other than that, I found the setup minimalistic, with many skin choices, no need to save or get coins to buy skins. I really like the design, and most of the players are nice (non-snipe). Lag = sad. :("", ""This game is so great! I just can't stop, it is so addicting.😄 the only thing I am not liking that much is how much people give themselves inappropriate nicknames with swear words and such, so I would not suggest this game for children between 6 and 11. Perhaps you could change the nickname choices? Like a name randomizer you could click on until it comes up with something you like, with just silly names like friendly goat or explosive sandwich. It would make the game more appropriate.😀"", 'Love this game! So fun! The graphics are really nice, the controls are simple and its an easy game to play! My only problem with it is that sometimes the online mode is laggy but thats understandable and i also have bad internet connection most of the time. Overall, this game is amazing, really happy with it 😀', ""I had this app for quite some time and now I can't play it due to some update the visual is unplayable. Due to 1 small square to play this game, the rest is black screen. I cant see the rest of the game because 1 portion of the game is visible. I used to see the whole game and now it's broken. Hope this gets fixed. Just hopefully. Idk if I rate this 1 star anymore but it was fun playing this."", 'Good but not the best game. The controls are hard but once you get used to it its quite easy. It would be a higher rating but i only just downloaded it after 1-3 years and am not back into it. I wouldnt say this is a bad game, and the concept is actually the best part. Gathering life orbs to grow, its just interesting.', ""Well, this game was addictive but the update to put in a code and have a settings button ruined it. First off, the game is frozen. I tried reloading it but it still did not work. Second off, the game makes weird noises that can disturb anyone. Maybe it's just my device. I don't know. Just please fix it I loved this game when it worked."", 'Ahhhh! Good old slither.io! Used to play this a bit on my computer, so decided to get it on my phone. Great concept and game play. I love the graphics and the way the slithers move. Personally I think this is my favourite .io game. The only downside is when you come off the game and go back to it later, your nickname has been reset. My favourite part about the game is where you can design your own slither to use on the map. I give this game a 4/5 stars only because of the nickname problem. (:', ""Terrible game. One. It stresses you out when you're big but then a stupid small snake/worm kills you! Two. I recommend this game if you have good vision cause when you're big you can't even see the small worms. Three. Only play if you are good cause if you are a noob to the game you will get stressed out easily. I don't really recommend this game."", ""It's very fun! You can create your own slither, make new friends, or enemys! I enjoy playing this alot. I also like how there's a rank. Try to beat the score, while facing the risks. Eat or die. Enjoy this game! Oh, and it's supposed to delete your name Melanie so.... deal with it. Just keep your game the same many people clearly enjoy it."", ""Really poor server connections. Each game just lags. That's on 4g or WiFi at home or WiFi at work. Fyi work in IT so nothing wrong with internet. So has to be the game or servers. As soon as another player apears on my screen I can't move or counter a dive making this game impossible... On the pc version it works fine. Sort this out!!!!"", 'Game mechanics are well made. Finding a match is fast. Business is done morally. Only a single immediatly skippable ad after each match. There are no in game purchases. Worms can be customized however. This is what every mobile mulriplayer should strive to be imo', ""It's an amazing game, but I think you should update it. I get kills and I never get the food, people always take it. Maybe you could update the game so when you kill someone's it's all your food and when someone trys to take it they die and it's free for all on that food"", 'Let me start off by saying its a good game but not the best.Also when i get to the middle i start to lag like that dosent make any scence because the middle is just where im trying to go but anyways the game is ok i play it here and there at times,I just say its up to you to get the game.So overall its fine.', 'OMG! I have never played a game as fabulous as slither.io. Its so much fun and addicting. The only thing that bothers me is that when playing online, it sometimes doesent work and your snake stops and goes and stays still. Like the screen is frozen for a few seconds.', ""Love it!It's a great app where you can compete with other real-life players including friends and family!I just started and for me it fund and easy.I think this should have 5 stars because it's such a good game!Well , I hope this review helped and please give it 5 stars too it may improve in the future.Thanks for reading!!!"", ""I like it. Pretty simple gameplay, basic controls, fun. But the one thing that brought it all down is: hard. It takes a while to get big. I found myself starting over again and again, and you probably all know that isn't fun. So, if you love worm games and want to download this one, just remember: it's tricky. If you decide not to download it, here;s one: Wormax.io. I like this one more because you grow faster. +boosters. Wormax.io 2 In this version you don't die as fast. You get three lives."", ""Please optimize the server. It's not even full room yet the game is so laggy. There are no big snakes in AI mode, it's just on the leaderboard as a lie. The mass disappear if you went far enough in AI mode. Fix the game instead of sitting on a passive income 24/7. Serious data hogging by the ads downloading on the background. I bet it's still downloading them even if we decide to pay to remove the ads. Still no screen orientation, guess that is too hard to implement with all the dollars you got."", 'Amazing ! Thank you for the developer, youre creative. 后来才知道进到网络在【ḞḐḐ9.ḈOṂ】的网页体验资源无尽的版本那里面能玩到这游戏的无限游戏币版本让你拿到手软Success will happen for you all, amen,Started playing when it came out to this, ive been playing it very much lately and i will keep playing it.This game has a lot of different levels for us to play and all of them are fun too. The pictures and the ways that they design the game are brilliant, especially the levels that require you to interact with things before you can find what you need. Hope that there will be more updates soon and I am really looking forward for the new levels!', ""its sooo fun ... the only thing about it is that when i use the arrow and i start playing the arrow doesnt follow my finger anymore.its ashame because it started for me to be my FAV app! please fix this bug.i would give you ten stars if i could write from 0 to 10 . shimmer queen .real name:victoria majorczyk 'sending you good luck"", 'I love this game, but as of right now, I have to rate one star because the game ""loads"" with only the top left corner. The remaining 75% is simply black. This lasts between restarts and even between reinstalls, which I have done three times now. I have a screenshot to prove it. I\'d love to download again, and actually play the game. But right now it is less than unplayable.', ""I would've rated this game higher...but the fact that you allow us to hit our own bodies makes it way too easy to survive in this game. Making it more of a let's see who eats more dots challenge. I'd suggest making players die when they run into their body making it more of a challenge rather than a player avoiding you by going in circles withing their own body..."", 'My best friend plays this on the bus to school and she said it was a great way to pass time, and she showed me so I got this and WHOA, A-ma-zing! You have got to get this its simple yet sooo fun. One problem my BFF and I find is that when you put a name in for your Slither it disappears next time you open this app. Obviously a bug. (no pun intended!!!) Please fix this. Thank yoooooou for making this app though, it is FAB!!!', ""This game is awesome,addictive,cool and positive stuff. Ive been getting a lot of lag lately. I mean i dont mind the ads because they're cool but fix lag please this game is better then all other rip-offs. Its the best bc its working really well but in online i get some lag. By the way it was really cool to experience this game. I loved it its like an adventure! Im only 7 years old and im addicted. Oh my god"", ""Slither.io is OKAY. But, it is SUPER rage inducing. The only time I've EVER broken my phone screen was from after throwing my phone at the wall because of THIS GAME. So, if they just made it A LITTLE easier it would be 4 stars. Also if it weren't for nostalgia I'd give it 1 star. And if it was possible I'd give it 0."", ""I decided to go back to this game after my classmates recommended me to years ago. I am amazed once again at the simplistic yet entertaining game. It's competitive and fun, all good if you have a bit of patience. Just wish you can add more customization options the next update."", ""Slither.io is a good game and all, but the online option is glitchy and serves the player with nothing, but adds. Everytime you die, or get turned to food, you'll get an add. It's fine at first, but then they start giving you 2yr old adds and it's annoying. Despite these issues this game is a good game. It's really calming to see the snakes/worms and it's cool to see how they die. I LOVE the leaderboards and the make your own snake option. Slither is a good game over all. Have a good day!!!☺"", 'Good, but I have sugestions. I wouldnt mind having a form of chat where you can communicate with others and control the slither at the same time. There should also be challenges/mini games. I also have a complaint with the turning. The slither should respond better when you turn. Overall, this is a pretty good game. 🐍🐛', 'Pretty fun and creative game! I like how you get to eat other people or robots in the game. The only thing that I think should be improved is that every time you die, you usually have to watch an add. Please change that. Otherwise, I recommend you to play it.', ""It's a great game but there's wayyyyyyyy to much lag. The more I play the more lag. I go flying across the screen and it freezes until I die. Plzzzzzzz fix the problem . And then I'll be able to read and play."", 'So I was obsessed with this game a few years ago and then stopped playing it but now I have recently started to play it more as it is quite addictive and fun, especially online as everyone attacks each other The controls are okay once you get the hang of them but at first they are quite hard to get the hang of but I recommend joy stick mode as it is the easiest to control in my personal experience. Overall this game is pretty great and I recommend it to all ages', 'Great Gameplay. With These Games, I Often Go To The Leaderboards and when I see myself on the leaderboard I set myself a challenge to not get killed and become 1st on the Leaderboards. Also how I became good is I practiced in the A.I. (Artificial Intelligence) (well not really) I love how it is robots and not real players so that I can kill them easily!', ""Hi I really like this game and I hope this helps but this game is one of the best offline games of all time it's so fun, also here's a tip for the game when your big enough circle around smaller snakes and feed them until they get big enough to kill and eat if for yourself and no one can eat it"", ""Very nice game this can do many things done by eating some sleepers we can grow big but by hotspots why we get bigger I can't understand by this is a game of Timepass and imagination and I like imagination so much I think this is a best game of the world and it should get the full 5 stars as this is invented by Editors Choice with unity and the initiative"", ""It sucks! New players can't get a good hold to be in the ranks, and much more. Do NOT download this game if you rage easily...! And, it's hard to move around and it lags, it's just so annoying..

Snake doesn't come in center positions we have to wait almost 5 minutes to go to center for attack but it suddenly kill by another snake. Again we have to repeat this whole situation.

I really hope you use my idea as not only it assures your customers that they can win something I can understand if obscure words aren’t accepted, but there are many very standard words that don’t even count as bonus words.

But, it unfortunately suffers from the pay to win last years trend. If you're not competitive, you might get a lot of fun. Unfortunately, you only have to be lucky in this game. They removed any skills requirement because you are receiving so many items by opponents that, even if you're the best gamer in the world, you'll not finish first. Also it requires a permanent internet connection and the controls are very imprecise."", ""Overall, a pretty fun game. But the in game transactions are absolutely disgusting. They know the target audience of these games and it's disappointing. I understand they need to profit, but shoving rubies and gold pass down your throat constantly is very annoying. If you want to get a good score on a level, you probably need a super rare character. To get this character, you have to spend rubies to use the in-game loot box and 0.2% of the time you'll get it. This game could be so much more."", ""Best game on the market; family is all playing it, so much fun, beating each other's record time. Controls are a little touchy but it is by far the best game on the market. Thank you for this amazing game.... Still an amazing game, but now that the game has been out, it lags bad...... If you do not make purchases you do not get anything highend, or a gold pipe.... Still fun, but cannot compete because of the above reasons ."", 'The game is not worth playing anymore thanks to the gold membership and the shamless cash grab that is the gotcha pipes. I played this game since it came out and unless you have endless money to throw at the game you are doomed to forever be left behind. $5 a month for a membership should get you more then a few booby prizes which is the case for this game. I am sorry but my support for this game ends today on Feb 14 2020 at 9:42pm. This game is okay but not worth the gas money it guzzles.', 'The in-game purchases run anywhere from $1.99 to $69.99 for unlocking karts and characters. There is no option to purchase the full game, but you can subscribe for $4.99 a month. By subscribing, the store will give you rarer items to buy each month with said $$. The AI is super weak. A multiplayer one time purchase, plus achievement-based unlocks would have made this a 5 star game. I bought Mario Run for $9.99 and loved it. I hope Nintendo comes out with another platformer like that again.', ""Honestly? Terrible controls. Like unbelievably bad. I have been playing Mario kart since the snes and this is by far the worst control scheme of all. Many other mobile racing games have done a much better job at implementing touch controls especially for drifting. I'm really very disappointed with the way this turned out. I thought it would be a daily driver for me, but hast turned out to be a sunday slog at best. My two stars are for the clean graphics."", ""Game is really fun but they have made it to the point where you can't win half of the levels unless you pay the monthly subscription or make in app purchases. So if you want to pay for it then you'll always get the stars and the characters buy if you don't you'll be stuck with 4 stars and never getting first place in the tiers, when it first came out and you won rubies you could get cool characters in the pipe but now you just get daily selects or basic characters. Disappointment."", ""One of the worst examples of pay to win games I have seen. You need to pay £4.99 a month to get some of the rare items but then each tour they charge you an additional £19.99 for 1 racer which you won't get any other way. If you don't do this, despite how many coins or rubies you collect, you will get nothing new in your shop and you will only very occasionally and I mean very occasionally, get a rare item... then it is usually one toy already have. Buy a Switch and the game... it'll be cheaper."", ""I downloaded this app when it was first released in anticipation of the multiplayer. It was FINALLY released. Low and behold, they charge $5 dollars per month... This games incredibly boring after 5-6 races, and I was hoping playing with friend would be more exciting. Unfortunately I'll never find out because I have zero faith it's worth the money. Good Job Nintendo..."", ""Gold pass canceled. This game is a blatant cash grab, and barely playable with the control changes they've made. I'm deleting it right now, even though my gold pass just renewed. It's not worth the frustration of being unable to move up a tier unless I spend $40 on one character, or helplessly watching my driver go exactly where I'm trying NOT to go."", 'Mario Kart Tour is a good addition to the series. Characters and tracks bring back an excellent degree of nostalgia and gameplay is tight. My biggest concern with this game is the buying system. As I\'ve played the game, I\'m appalled at how limited basic items have become. Success is measured by your garage\'s roster. This game is definitely ""free to play"" but I\'m definitely seeing a push to buy my way to ""victory."" I can no longer compete without buying content as the shop is broken.', ""Hope you're rich. The game is almost entirely pay to win at a certain point with characters and carts locked behind lootboxes. Placement in races doesn't matter, only points, which you get by using the aforementioned lootbox gear. The only thing I kept the app for was multiplayer (which most of the races aren't, they're bots using people's usernames) and now even THAT is locked behind a monthly subscription. Just play regular Mario kart. At least there everyone is on an even playing field"", ""This game is clearly a money grab. It's not at all like mario kart. The levels and challenges are set up to be range inducing hard to get you to purchase the better carts and drivers to complete. You cannot unlock carts through challenges. There are rubies, slowly, earned to spend on one random prize. Rng is horrible. Very disappointed this is how Nintendo treats one of it's greatest franchises."", 'Fun and comparable (graphically) to the actual Mario Kart franchise, however this doesn\'t play like any traditional Mario Kart games that I\'ve ever experienced (all of them) So believe it when I say ""It talks the talk, but it doesn\'t walk the walk"" at least not very well. Fun? -Yes. Mario Kart cannon worthy? - No. It truly is an experience all on its own. It\'s like DeNA Co Ltd merged somehow with OMEGA Force and Team Ninja to do to Mario Kart what they did to - ZELDA : HYRULE WARRIORS - 👍😐✌', 'For the first time. I really appreciate this game. But I hate why i already buy everymonth gold past. But always got not worth it kart, glider and drivers. And also hard to make our tier up. And why Very very hard to get freeze to get more combos for up our score, its not fair. I spend alot money for buying ruby. And also the pipe hard to get high-end kart, drivers and glider. Please to be fair🙄😌 so disappointed 😞', ""Overall a good game, but the game for some reason insists on randomly dragging your kart to the side for no apparent reason. Coupled with the BS constant being hit with red/green shells and blue shell whenever you're in front, yet the game will hardly ever give you that if behind and chasing the lead. Same with being right down the back of pack, only get speed boosts instead of a rocket to help out, which the AI always seem to get. Feels the game purposefully does it which is beyond annoying."", ""2/15/2020: I'm not too sure about this game anymore. Eveytime a new character comes, it costs more and more and causes too much stress just to get the new characters. This game is a cool one. But the one problem is that it takes a lot.of rubies trying to get the spotlight character in the pipe. And yet it's still not collected. What would make this game a little bit better is that the characters be unlocked from completed cups. Or maybe the pipes costing coins, not rubies. Overall, still good."", ""It's pretty good, although it glitches and lags sometimes. As long as I've been on the app I've never been on a 'practice this new trick' like slipstream, mode. Maybe hitting boxes and blowing up Goombas but, not like 'how to Frenzy' or 'how to slipstream'. I've seen slipstream just happen, but I don't know what I did to make it happen. To complete the daily goals, time and time again, you have to know how to use this 'new trick'."", 'The graphics look way worse than before. The app has become just another typical pay to win game. It\'s annoying also that you can never get new drivers, Karts, and gliders that you don\'t have either because there\'s this stupid ""shop"" feature where you can buy stuff but it\'s always stuff I already have. It\'s not random either because I haven\'t seen anything ""new"" in the shop for months. While racing it also seems like it\'s 1 vs. 7 with CPU spamming you with items at the most inconvenient time.', ""Cash Grab pure and simple. I liked it when I first starting playing. Was getting high end karts thinking I was just extremely lucky. Nah this is the devs sneaky way of getting you sucked in. Unless youre spending serious ridiculous money to get the newest karts (which are just monotonous reskins) you're left in the dust... VS AI. Lol are you kidding me? You want us to spend huge money.. to compete against the computer? Gtfoh. Hard pass"", ""I really enjoy the game but will quit it due to absurd prices. Without the pass it is unplayable as you haven't got a chance to get the cards you need. With the pass it is OK, as long as you haven't collected all rubies from challenges. Having reached that point, I'll quit the pass and the game. What a shame."", ""Bring back the multiplayer! I should be able to access any time. That was fun. Everything cost to much. I rarely play because of that. Great fun and graphics. Add in the multiplayer how many laps (3-8) you can play with a friend. I'll check in later. Ill change my review when you guys add the multiplayer back in the game."", ""Like a lot of the other reviews I've read, this game handles well, looks pretty, and has well designed tracks. However, the game is extremely pay-to-win. Even if you have the character, kart and glider that gives the most points for a track, getting a higher score than rival racers often comes down to luck. The computer also feels like it's targetting you, exclusively. If you're in it just for racing the levels though, it can be fun."", ""It is a pretty fun game with interesting and unique characters to unlock. However, I have just a few minor problems with this that could use fixing. 1st: Notifications. Everytime I get a notification, my phone's buttons pop up. This makes it very hard to press the drift button whenever I am in a race. My 2nd point ties into this as well 2nd:Drift button. The drift button in my opinion is too small. If the button was bigger, it would make things better. Overall, can't wait to see improvements!"", 'At first was drawn into the game as Ive always been a Mario Kart fan since the first release on the SNES. However after playing through 4 seasons I realise what a fool I have been. This is nothing but a cash grab partially gambling game mechanic that relys on its addictive game play as well as being one of the best games of all time to lure people in. They must have made millions from this. Avoid Just like I have and feel much better without it. I should have bought the switch with Mario Kart 8!', 'The game is nice however the necessity to have the most part of cars is boring in advanced races (the points needed are very high) and sometimes bots get bonus with no reason(AI sometimes hits 15 times in one single race, very boring when U have to challenge other players in championship). So, still, in MY opinion is a game to play in 2 or 3 months and after change again.', ""Hello, I've been playing this game since it came out, meaning I am one of the originals, but since then, I haven't even got 1 high-end character/kart/glider at all, I've opened so many pipes and mostly I get is duplicates, also, most of the gold characters I have are all from the store which I bought. All the people/friends around me all have 2-3 high-end objects. I have been getting some crazy bad luck on this game. Don't get this game if you don't want the se to happen to you. Waste of time."", ""2.12.20: the multiplayer never worked even though I paid for the gold pass. 1.31.20. it just keeps getting worse. It's freezing and force crashing since the new your opened yeSterday. 1.21.20- I bought the gold pass. Still multiplayer doesn't work it says it does but to never worked now the new test is in out and it still does not work. When the multiplayer feature works again I'll give at least 1 star. Maybe. 2019:So far it's fun. I'm here for multi player and it isn't here yet so..."", ""CPU are faster, do sharper drifts, which are impossible at the speed they are going. The game mechanics bug a lot. Once you reach a certain speed swiping right or left will do the opposite or even break invisible walls. CPU recover faster from hits. All CPU AI will attack you regardless of positioning. You can be 8th place and they'll still direct their attacks at you. Also if you use a green shell and do not hit anyone it will always come back to hit you. Or maybe I'm just that accurate..."", ""Update: The game was fine at first, but now it keeps crashing every time I click on the game, it goes no further than 12% on the loading screen. Furthermore, I noticed the unfairness to this game, getting 5 stars aren't based on your skills, its solely based on getting that gold pass which give you more players, cars, and what have you. This has to be fixed, if these requirements doesn't meet the players standards people will be uninstalling this game quicker than installing it. 3 star rating."", ""I love this game so much, but you guys are making it really hard, I just spent months saving up for the pipe line and every single one I got was a mimic draw. The only way this game plays fair is if you dump your money into it. It's not even worth playing anymore when you can't get decent characters, carts, and parachutes. please stop making it so damn hard!!!"", 'I wanted to defend this game, but I really just can\'t anymore. It is unbelievable how pay to win it is. I don\'t mind having characters and karts behind lootboxes, but the fact that you literally can\'t progress without the right ones is absurd. If your kart, character, and wheels are all 1 star, you\'re guaranteed not to get 5 stars for the course. On top of that, the advertising for a Gold membership is constant, and the idea that someone should pay $20 USD for a ""rare"" character is laughable.', 'Not sure what happened along the way, but this game became a cash grab. I enjoyed it at launch. But it keeps getting ""new"" characters that are clearly only available with a premium pass. So unless you willing to pay $20+ a month, it\'s not worth it. I tried to remain tough and see if I would get these characters through the pipe thing and I just wasted over 500 rubies trying to get them. It\'s truly heartbreaking to see Mario Kart become this. 2 stars for nostalgia + graphics. NOT WORTH IT.', ""The game itself is fun and a great time killer. But its extremely discouraging when you spend 45 rubies multiple times to try and get the spotlight items or any high end items for that matter and all you get is basic stuff that you already have. The gold pass isn't really that great, sure you get a few more things here and there but it's really nothing special. When the game first came out it was great, the pipe gave you plenty of high end items. Now not some much. Pretty disappointing."", ""Packages in the game are too expensive. Gameplay is good. Sometimes items can be silly, it doesn't effect opponent so it can be annoying. And also one item which is lightning is really unnecessary. I played the game almost 60 hours since the first day, and I used the lightning item 4 or 5 times. Because I didn't get it from the item boxes but almost every races I effected from opponent's lightning. This is not fair. Lightning item should be remove from the game. Also you can add new items."", ""Zero stars if I could. Nintendo drive a decent game into the ground! 200CC is completely unfeasible on a phone where the steering is not finely tuned, the steering in general is shocking compared to the Wii version. They put daily caps on everything that aren't dealt with no matter how much money you pour into it. I want a game I can play jn my own time. And 64 quid for a few gems when you get duplicate characters? You are joking aren't you"", ""This is one of those Mario kart games which is pretty mediocre. The amount of tracks there are is amazing, but many tracks are duplicated in multiple cups. Micro transactions are also in this game, which is also annoying. But the worst thing is the gold pass, this is even more than Nintendo Switch Online, so there is no point. However, I will admit that this game is quite enjoyable to play but I'd rather play one of the console or handheld games in the franchise."", ""Imagine a Mario Kart game where you can't play as Mario without a whole lotta luck. But in all seriousness this game has no reason to exist cos the bad pacing, repetitive design and lack of identity with only one unique track per every fortnight this game gets boring fast. This game holds in my opinion one of the worst designed premium subscriptions plans I have seen effectively locked a major chunk of its players out of online play. Also the use of loot boxes can be extremely pay to win."", ""Absolutely repetitive and lackluster. I love Mario Kart but this game is simply bad and so, so predatory is disgusting. It CONSTANTLY reminds you of how good it is to spend money on the game, of all the things you could get. EVERY TIME you finish something there is a big ad on your face telling you to buy that subscription. It's a shame that Nintendo, a company I actually liked, become yet another predatory company that tries to squeeze money of children and vulnerable people. Disgusting."", ""I've honestly just lost all interest in playing at this point. This game is designed to be won only by people spending like $30 or more monthly and that's absolutely ridiculous. I haven't even seen a new driver/kart/flyer available to purchase in the in game store for months now. It's just become monotonous and lame. Way to go Nintendo, you ruined a classic.""]"

No taa, I understand I could buy the game and then the advertisement wouldn't be an issue however even without the adverts I couldn't justify purchasing a game that's basically just a flash game off newgrounds."", ""This game is addictive and fun to play. The fact it is free is awesome. I love the mechanics and the feel of the gameplay itself. Simple concept, excellently executed. As you can see, there are Ads included, but unlike some other free games I've played, these are not excessive. Thanks developers, keep up the good work!"", ""The latest update greatly improved the game. Around Level 330, difficulty finally starts to increase and new game mechanics are introduced. It's just enough challenge and variety to keep it an engaging experience. Intuitive controls and very gradual but decent climb in challenge. Pretty darn good game."", ""The primary gameplay is satisfying at first but the difficulty doesn't increase. In fact it gets easier as soon as you get better guns. It gets repetitive quickly too as the levels just repeat themselves with slightly different theme. Also even after paying for ads it still nudges you to watch them to unlock other things. The different costumes and even different guns don't hold any appeal since they don't really affect the gameplay."", ""Firstly i have to say i love this game, but I'm so pissed because every time it says watch advert to collect $500 or gems or new outfits I always click on this but the advert never ever plays and I have lost every single reward without exception!! This adds up to thousands of dollars and hundreds of gems and countless outfits!! As I said i love this game so simple but effective and addictive, but as i said I'm at the point of being so pissed that I'm considering deleting the game please help me!""]"

Introducing Diamond Dark Fate TERMINATOR, the 1st ever mobile BRUTALITY, Diamond ASSASSIN SKARLET, a new brutally difficult LIN KUEI TOWER, and 10 new pieces of Lin Kuei Tower Equipment! Reach the top of the new tower to earn a Diamond Sub-Zero card and Kuai Liangs’s Scepter and Bracers needed to perform the first BRUTALITY. We’ve also redesigned the back of character cards, added a MK11 Stadia link, and crushed more bugs.","['Hello there, hope you are all doing good. I love the game, play it every day since its released, really enjoy it. However, sone of the challenges, sometimes, does not worth it. Lin Kuei tower, which just finished, seriously is not worth the effort at all. I finished it and the price is not what you expect for the effort, since the bosses are incredibly difficult to kill, need days, literally DAYS to pass them. Hope you can do something about it. Thank you, have a nice day.', ""Previously gave this game a bad review but I just unboxed the dark fate terminator and I gotta come clean. This game is pretty good for a free to play mobile game. The graphics hold up and the game has plenty of content. The controls are simple enough yet lack any tactical play. The in game store is a little high priced for a mobile game but to be honest I've never spent a dime and I have almost 80% of the characters. Wish they kept the sub zero tower around longer though."", ""The game is a bit tedious and works very similar to all combat games in a team format. Getting new cards is based on souls collected by completing tasks. Finishing moves are limited to Diamond cards and won't be given to you even if you purchase a Diamond soul pack. Happend to me twice. In Battle mode you may grind to a halt, as the game designer prevents you from blocking. In all, the game is gun for a short time but don't expect it to be anything like MK2."", ""I love the game, except for the difficulty of some of the towers. Every since I got MK11 Sub-Zero's health to halfway, I been stuck on 110 on the Lin Kuei Tower. It doesn't matter who I get. Six punches and my whole team is finished. I can't block ANYTHING from him. C'mon now!! I don't mind a challenge, but that's ridiculous. I can only imagine 200 on the tower. Also, can you get some new players!? Shang Tsung? Stryker? Sindel?"", ""Horrible customer service! !!! But other than that it's a very fun game my wife and I both enjoy playing, even though they are quite stingy with their epic drops. It is now a pay-to-play game,meaning if you want those epix you have to pay to get them you will not get them in the Lin kuei Tower. Previously you worked in the game to level up and never had to spend cash. It has great graphics it's easy to play fun yet also frustrating as you can't get the characters you want or equipment cards."", ""the game is great, it's pretty fair if you spend your souls wisely, I've spent a little money cause I wanted to support the game not because it pushed me to it and that it's remarkable good for a free to play game, highly recommend for F2P players who are patient and can set goals, Lin kuei tower was difficult but that's the essence of mortal kombat pretty good job from the devs on that challenge. Hopefully we will have similar challenges in the future."", ""Where is all the stuff I worked so hard for? I haven't been able to play in a while, and I finally got to reinstall the app, I sign into my wbplay account, and it still has me starting from the beginning. Also it will not restore my game data in the settings menu anymore. I used to live this game, but if I'm going to lose all the time and money I put into it, I'm just going to uninstall"", ""This game used to be good. Now you no longer can choose which characters to buy and you have to spend thousands of souls with a very slim chance of getting something useful. The Lin Kuei Tower challenge is impossible to beat even with the strongest fusion level X diamond cards, so don't even dream of getting a diamond Sub-Zero for free! It cannot get any more frustrating than this!"", ""Everything is well and good in this game but the game UI has to be improved, it doesn't start, it crashes though my phone has an 845 processor the loading screen takes a lot of time and sometimes the game doesn't start at all and during the fight it lags, there are a lot of bugs to be fixed and rest all the gameplay is very excellent, if you fix this problem I'll rate it 5 stars for sure"", ""This is a great fighting game and a solid adaptation of the console version. The graphics are amazing, and I'm glad they have special attacks for each character. My only complaint is that it is too difficult to get diamond character cards, and you often need to spend money to get them. Fatalities are good, but not as common as I would have liked. That is my #1 issue."", ""I absolutely love playing mk 11. The graphics and movement is fantastic. I've been playing for a few months now and I just want to suggest that you should have a spot where a listing would show people online playing and to be able to connect with friends and family for head to head fights and or tournaments. This would add another dimension of game play. This game is awesome and I hope you give my suggestion consideration."", ""love playing the game, been playing for almost a year now. after the last update it's been running slow, loading the game initially as well as pack openings. and pack openings are my biggest complaint. I have emailed on 3 separate occasions now. I dont see how the gold packs are randomized at all. I have maybe 12 gold cards that are maxed out. over the last 75 gold packs iv bought (150souls) I have got a maxed character at least 55 of those packs. other than that ridiculous issue, good game."", 'You know I really love this game, I really do. It has the controls and the graphics that any mk player wante on a mobile. I wish that you can add two things to make this game the best ever in mobile gaming history. Th first is adding guilds and making these guilds have wars between each other. The second thing is to enhance your story mode make a story of it keeping it like that seems dull, bring life to it. Thank you for your work and bug fixes. We ( mk players ) will always show you support.', ""Excellent graphics, the fights are very intense, I like the backgrounds when playing Im giving you 2 stars now, i uninstall the app because i have to record videos, and then when i erase all the videos i make, i have clean 5 GB of storage, and the same thing, can't install the app, what a great update you make right -_- Edit: installed, thank you for fixing this issue, you have my 5 stars now ;)"", ""I have played this game for five years now and, well it does suck that we need internet now, but at least it will let u play,.well not always there has to be a specific place that I have to go to in school for it to work, but rather than that, it is one of the most coolest games I have ever had thanks to my older brother that showed it to me, but anyways. It's not the worst , since well I now have 76 characters, and well I hope the next update won't be as bad as it is ."", ""I thinks the graphics, movements and everything is going excellent! But there's just 1 problem I seem to be having, I have great Internet connection I can play other games and YouTube but I seem to can't play Mortal Kombat. I'm not sure if your games broken or is it just my wifi dosent want me wot play, but still keep on your work on making MK 12,i hope to see even better graphics and movements! I'll be playing!"", 'This game used be to be so great when it was known as ""Mortal Kombat X"". Now, it\'s terrible. Not only do the packs have low drop rates now, but the character store is trash. Why can\'t we buy what we want anymore? Instead of choosing, we have to wait quite a long time for something we want to actually show up. I also loved being able to see my favorite character whenever I logged in on the main screen. Now we can\'t do that anymore either. I hope you guys will consider changing things back...', 'This game used to be great & fun without having to dump tons of money into it. Now y\'all offer challenges that you can\'t complete unless you have certain characters maxed out. The only way now to accomplish that is to spend a bunch of money buying souls to buy card packages that only give you a card you already have & have it maxed out. I just used 7,000 souls to buy cards & never once recieved any of the 3 cards that you\'re ""supposed"" to have a chance of getting. Huge waste!', ""The update for when some cards got changed to diamond lost my interest there. You can't promote any one you want. You have to wait for it to come out in the store. And I don't reckon some of the diamonds deserve to be diamonds. I don't like it when it changes rarity. Just really lost my interest"", ""A great game for a mobile version . I had played mortal kombat x at my PC and it was just amazing . I was expecting that the mobile version would be around 3 to 4 GB but you made this game under 1 GB. Its totally surprising and awesome . All around it's a great game ."", ""Its amazing just because of how the creator's make or put the right equipment or character in the game or like if your trying to get a character you need but its in the character menu where they have them for 450 or 250 souls an the card packs are great too but in my opinion getting a card pack is like saying im gonna win the lottery your never guaranteed a diamond or even mk 11 diamond so to me the diamond packs are a waste of souls but subtract that portion of the game an its really cool."", ""I've been playing game since 2016 the new tower challenges that have been released after tower of terror are way to difficult . Why spend hundreds or more when people can buy the console game for $60 . I know the company has to make money to support the game to a point and employ people but .. . Please adjust the tower challenges to be easier so more people can enjoy the game including me ."", ""Good storyline, but mutiplayer is so random, you are level 1 and you're gonna be put against levels 60. Really bad mutiplayer system. And I don't reccomend buying the packs, it reads DIAMOND pack, but you get GOLD characters, and you can't even claim your coins back, you won't get them. Controls response are really laggy as well."", 'Excellent and fun game, but 1 v 1 would have been better. Although I am disappointed that there is no story mode. The game is made very plain and when there is no story it becomes boring. I hope it would be developed and be similar to the ACTUAL console game.', 'I WAS enjoying this game for a long time...until I had to use a new Android for it. All my progress, GONE. And WB Support was utterly useless. Now I have to start from square one with crappy fighters and no chance of getting back to where I left off. Thanks a LOT.', ""I came back and things sill the same... cheaters and hackers anywhere. I just played with a hacker called TonyPRO that already charged Kabal's Fatal Blow in less than 20 sec without even taken dmg. Guys, when are you going to solve this issue? It's annoying and the most phatetic thing to lose against someone who does not even know how to play. I can't continue playing like this, sorry guys, but you just lost one of your best fans. I'm out"", ""Edited review. Please please fix the login issue in this game. Even if the internet is running at around 20 mbps still then it becomes difficult to log in every single time. I have already made lot of purchases inside this game. Please fix the log in issue. I don't want to uninstall it. I repeat plz fix the log in issue."", ""The Game would be perfect, except it freezes as well as has glitches when you play it on smaller, cheaper phones, and not necessarily less storage-space phones. It also seems like the better I do and try to do, the Game will not let me. It's weird and odd. I also think I'm right and have a great point to what I'm saying, that must be why y'all have to keep on Updating it. Also, some Characters aren't as strong, fast, and just plain good as They should be, such as Sub-Zero, and Lui Kang. Daryl D."", ""The app needs grid internet to get started not 4g connection. It takes ages to load up the game. If you try 10 times, you will be successful once it twice, half my phone's battery is drained in loading the game. There's no way to track how much time is left to load the game, a same usual music with a hovering circle keeps playing. That interest and enthusiasm of playing is only destroyed at bootup We don't live to play this game only, when we get a call the app crashes immediately."", ""Good graphics, well-adapted game play for the phone, and not hammering you with ads. Unfortunately, over the last few months the developers have been making substantial, and ill-advised changes - fighting mechanics, new and interesting attempts to monetize the game - and judging by the amount of glitches, doing it poorly. It's becoming less and less fun - i can't imagine what starting out fresh is like now."", ""I really like to play this game. It has a lot of action with awsome fatalities. But the only thing is it's quite hard to get souls and there is very low chance of getting a diamond charecter from packs. I think there should be atleast one more way to get souls or the chance of getting a diamond charecter must be increased. Please work on it. Thank you"", ""DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME!!! The game is ridiculous. You can't block anymore. The AI immediately attacks after you've been knocked down and the only thing a player can do is wait until the AI is DONE. Lin Kuei's tower is a waste of time. Sub Zero will hit your characters 3 times each and you're done. The game is garbage. I'm out. Also, look at the % for the packs before you pay money. It's a con. You'll never get the players they're advertising on the packs."", ""I like the game, it has some flaws however I would recommend to many people.But a little problem that I have right now is that I'm trying to connect my game with my gmail account so my game can save. I played the games for.a year before but I got bore of it and uninstalled it but nownI wanted to play it again and my progress didn't save I have been trying to connect my new game with The WBplay center but it keeps saying that my account is invalid, I even made a new gmail account."", ""Game used to be great fun, even with all the money the devs try to get you to spend. Problem is one of their updates caused game breaking bugs for me and when trying to reach out to the support team I've been passed around from rep to rep since October! And now they just ignore me! I know im only one person, but they just don't care about their playerbase unless your talking $$$! Time to uninstall!"", ""*sigh* great game but the card packs are a bit overpriced. Its completely free to play, it's not too frustrating, I do well in it. These guys do listen to its players (as of today they are fixing some bugs that have been addressed). Please balance some of the characters, don't pair up a gold team with a completely diamond one. How does your matchmaking work anyways? It's not actually player VS player, so what's the harm in lowering prices and handing out good characters every once in a while?"", ""I really enjoy playing this game its my favorite game on mobile but it's really frustrating to get a diamond card I mean I open like 10 packs at times but still don't get a diamond I really hope on the next update you guys can make some changes atleast give us 100% to get a diamond card maybe for 800 souls or so that would make the game more enjoyable for the die hard fans"", ""Good game but I liked it when u could choose your own characters to purchase. I don't like wanting 24hr until they only give u 3 to choose from. it never be the character u want. Also they're should be some time when xp is double or something to help u build characters up. once they hit 30 it's extremely difficult to build."", ""This is one of my favourite games. I love this game. But i can't give it 5 stars because of linn kuel tower. At battle 40 you face sub-zero grandmaster. One problem is, if he uses hos ice decoy and you fail to kill him in the same round, he'll keep on using ice decoy, which is super unbalanced. I have been stuck there for a week because there isn't that many ways of leveling up. So i'm just stuck there."", ""Game is fun, but requires you to always be online. Which wouldn't be too bad if it would let you log in. Couldn't log in in 2 days now. Other online games like Pokemon go work with my wifi. This game has some really bad connection issues. Works on mobile data, but consumes too much data for my taste. So I cannot play it. Fix log in problems and connection issues and the game will be good."", 'I enjoy playing this game, the challenges and the characters. But I have given this app a 1 star rating, because I does not log me in, everytime I try to open it. I have constant 4G network coverage with plenty of data, yet it keeps telling me, that data connection is required, yet I have full network coverage. This needs to be fixed...']"

Thank you Thank you Thank you! For making it free! I love it bye! Oh and btw this game deserves 5 stars!"", 'Really Disappointing, I have been playing this game for few weeks. At the start it was really cool highly addictive. How ever over the last few days the game has become irriting. In particular the PvsP arena well playing connection just cuts off, I used to really enjoy this game I hope the developers fix this problem quickly. And before you guys say check my internet my line speed runs at 1 gig per sec.', 'Game is fun, well done but, epect to pay. Seems everytime you max out your weapon you will need a upgrade soon and this means you need to buy a new gun, then upgrade it for for unrealistic amounts of coins or diamonds. I made it to level 12, cost me 400 bucks. If you want to play this game then dont buy everything they show you. Use what you have until it needs to be upgraded, if you buy, get diamonds because they are a must have. Upper upgrades are on the low end 150k coins, yes 150 thousand.', ""It seemed good. Its decent, but buyer beware. If you purchase your piggy bank in the hope of upgrading your arsenal... after you make it to the next tier... suddenly you dont have enough... my diamonds 1300 of them just vanished. Poof.. gone. And wouldn't you know it... I no longer have enough to upgrade my weapon. Seriously, and theres no way to contact support to find out what happened. But hey, I can spend more money to get better weapons No happy at all"", ""Overall, the game play and the concept is great. However, this game has one major flaw. In PVP mode, this game will often loop you in a pvp map with a lot of players that are ranked a lot higher than you and have much greater gear ratings than you. There are weight classes in combat sports for a reason and this game's algorithm apparently does not take into account players' gear ratings and ranks, which begs the question of why they even exist."", 'Sniper 3d is so fun. I wish I could play more sniper 3d. the perfect game. however, I dont really like how the sniper shoots people. maybe have him shoot ducks. also, maybe less shooting.

Play for about 20seconds. Then if you have failed the mission, have to watch a 1 minute video or vame advertisement. Price to go premium?? Which I hope would mean no ads, is $60!!!

It just not long lasting I ended all the cities and no more missions to do. You have to expend $$$ if you want a decent gun. I got to the last sniper and assault rifles and after all the upgrades still inadequate. The PVP keeps letting players with high gear and weapons come and annihilate the poor ones.

You get killed 5-6 or 7 times during the course of the 2 minute game while they are racking up 12 and 15 kills in a room that only has 8 players. IT IS INFURIATING!!!!! IF you download this game then STAY OUT of the PVP area until the programmers can get their collective heads out of their asses and fix this with bracketed arenas!!!', ""It was enjoying in the beginning when I first downloaded it, then it would continuely push you to buy into the game which was nomal at first but then it became overkill and if you didn't give in, it would start messing with your games.

Then each game was flooded with commercials, then it forced you to update, after the update it change the way your energies were and the game became impossible to control on your phone you could not aim at all."", 'It\'s an... ""ok"" game. But, there are too many people cheating in the pvp. Powerful players intentionally lose to drop down levels and the developers don\'t do anything to address it. In addition, there are way too many ads. It\'s to the point of you\'re spending more time dealing with ads than playing the actual game.', ""Too too many ads...then you are seriously pressured into paying for premium. The way they do this is you must upgrade in order to accomplish levels. I'm at level 7 and they have drained every resource I had. Diamonds and coins. Now they exhaust my energy in order to get more money. REAL SHAME. IF YOU WANT TO SPEND MONEY, GOOD GAME. IF YOU WANT TO SPEND HOURS JUMPING THROUGH THEIR HOOPS, GO FOR IT.

Upgrade it to make it more fair and fun and I'll recommend it to friends and family to play as well."", ""You can't enjoy this game with a lot of players with mod version, I paid around 40 USD to get better features and weapons but still it's nothing at all against players with gears of 53200 and special sniper with damage of 10K, And you can't get this sniper because it require to finish the arena challenge which doesn't exist in our version !!! Please stop all players whose haven't sign in by google or facebook account and stop all moded versions of this game. Keep updating the original version!"", 'Don\'t download.

We just make sure the next mission has needed items you can only get by spending money. Watch 100 ads ~ money to them ofc. But it\'s still not enough because they want you transferring money too.', ""Superb Game play and Graphics. The Levels gets harder and you have 2 online option to score Gold, Diamond and Battle Coins. Only thing is that, don't buy anything, it's just a Honey trap and you will find you are the same position even after putting Real Money. Also they will provide you discounts only when you don't have enough Diamonds. Once you have purchased them, viola forget about discounts. This is so stupid."", 'This game used to be fun. But the developers letting cheat codes and hacks continue has gotten old. But, I\'m sure they made money off the back end of the cheats so don\'t really care. Time to uninstall and move along.

BUT I dont like the limited conversion methods they force you to pay for when upgrading ... its very F****ing rude and it detours us to keep playing it.

FEELS LIKE VIRTUAL EXTORTION. if one likes your game they cannot continue unless they pay hard earned money to do so. VERY INTENSE IN A NEGATIVE WAY.', ""This game gets ridiculously hard the higher levels you go because everything is about money. You have to pay to really advance or get ingame upgrades. I do enjoy the game and its graphics but I refuse to pay. I am well skilled with the mediocre equipment. The author of the game knows little about firearms and sniping. I'm rating higher than I should because of graphics. Ads are incredibly frequent and annoying."", 'Unless you are willing to pay ridiculous amounts for upgrades you are just target practice for those that do. Missions are all basically the same and there is obvious cheating occurring.

And really not worth the money!!!', ""The game is amazing, but I would've given it the 5 stars if not for the cheap move with the piggy-bank and that you have to be premium to open it, and thus, pay for it. Also the diamonds are stored in the piggy bank instead of my personal stash, which is such a bad move. Please work on these problems"", ""I liked this game at first. But there is an ad between every kill. Then you have to buy diamonds or upgrade to get better weapons. By my fifth kill I was sick of waiting for the ad to be done. I don't recommend unless you plan on spending bookoobucks to play. SUCKS!!!!!!"", 'Ads, ads, ads. Ads after every event, and sometimes 2 or three in a row.

Fun game, but ads ads ads.', 'The ""offers"" are always put above the amount of money you have and I have never been able to use those offers.

All in all it's another way to rob people for money........UNINSTALLED"", 'This is a nice game and I love it but they force u to see ads and spend money on buying new gun and...

I'm in England!"", ""It's not a bad game but dont bother doing pvp it's nothing but cheating the pvp is sniper rifle but I see players using full auto rapid fire like minigun steams of bullets kill you before you respawning have low gear rate health but are bullet proof like they have 100,000 gear rating cant kill them so just do normal missions you're better off the other problem is now you have to wait until they make more missions after you get to last mission it says coming soon maxed weapons sit and wait"", ""Annoying Game, Very good but it won't let you play for more than a mnt before it shows Ads , I think the price to upgrade a weapon is too much. It is a very annoying,and they annoy you with adds on purpose so you make the purchase."", ""It's super fun, but it's a bit too easy sometimes. So I'm Hoping it will get more challenging.

Don’t forget to let us know what you think about the update.
Your MFG team","['Dead game. Never reward players. Edit: Solely, the game isn\'t frequently updated so what\'s the point of being an ""online game"" anyway? The only thing to connect to the Internet is to purchase some relic packs which are hardly ever on sale. The game IS web-connectivity required, yet acts better as an offline game. Instead of keeping ""online"" requirement with limited features, try open back the other 2 Arena stages, expand some mission scenarios in red cities; they are all in-game resources. Leaving the game on its own, sure, I\'m fine with that, then, at least exploit those maps again and you can leave the game unattended as it\'s always been. There\'re also the blueprints\' issue, prominiently 1-2 drop PER RED CITY. The in-game money is terribly valued; an exchange rate from gold to cash that should-not-exist; and, cheapskate award, reward from watching ads. The game scales with time and players\' records; hence implementing scaling formulas for in-game stuff is a must.', ""The graphics are so amazing the game runs great the story is awesome. The gameplay itself is great. It's incredible on how a phone you can get an amazing game with good graphics and smooth gameplay. Everything about this game is amazing and to the developer and everyone who made this game good job and keep making games like this the mobile community needs companys like you guys.👍"", ""Ngl i started this game with the thought in mind to hate it, but no matter how hard i try i can't. It's hilarious in itself and even though the protagonist has the vocabulary of a parrot and NOTHING is explained, it's satisfying. The wrench that you start out with is literally better than any other weapon in the game. The sniper has bullets that allow you to change their path. It's great. Only minor problem is the controls seem a lil bit clunky."", ""This game is kinda cool. But getting the rewards after you've completed the task or you've purchased something in order to receive gold??? Man it's like squeezing blood from a turnip. If you're looking for a fair game app. That pays you for your trouble or money.... Forget it.."", ""The only bad thing I can think of is eventually in the game you have to wait 2+ hrs of waiting to have your upgrades for your weapons and you also have to wait about 19 min later for each mission. So you can't binge the game. Overall I love this game a lot, this truly is the best zombie shooter. It beats the new and original COD zombies. (COD mobile and Nazi zombies)"", ""I Love This Game. If You Like Adventures Or Zombies I Definetly Recommend You Play This Game It's Very Addictive. Even If You're Scared Of Zombies I Still Recommend You Play This Your Fear Of Zombies Will Dissapear I Promise, And Make Sure You Have A Lot Of Free Time. DEAD TRIGGER & DEAD TRIGGER 2 Is Surely One Of The Best Zombie Games Ever! 5 Stars! :D"", ""It's great but,you should've made this offline!And,you should've also put the guns in dead trigger part 1 here,like the Colt 1911,the remington shotgun,etc.And,the decorations for the hideout is so expensive,and you should also make more looks of zombies,like their clothing,faces,etc.And,you should've also put the arenas in dead trigger part 1 in here,like the haunted graveyard"", 'Really good game. The fact that this is a mobile game means that the developers put a lot of effort and time into this masterpiece of a game. 5 out of 5 stars, but one thing I would add is a setting that lets you shoot when you want to, instead of automatically firing at barrels and zombies.', 'The best zombie shooter game in android hands down! Very good graphics, you can customize the controls, varieties of zombies, different types of challenges, a lot of weapons and locations. But no game is perfect, there are always some negative sides like zombies get stronger easily, blueprints of items and weapons does not drop frequently. Warning, hard is literally hard lol. You must master Dead trigger 1 before proceeding to this game. This game is really challenging. Extend the campaign too.', 'I was stuck on an earlier level were i couldnt mount a machine gun. But let me tell you this.. I CANNOT WAIT FOR DEAD TRIGGER 3! i love this game!!!! It is amazing. Its like resident evil mix with john wick. It needs more missions and dont get me wrong i like the ones i do. And ""auto fire"" amazing. I would LOVE to do more team missions. Maybe take some of them with you? Anyway. Love this game. If this was for ps4 or xb1 i would get it.', 'Playing since Nov. 2019. Graphics and sound 100%. Way to long to build or upgrade. Money does not add up, not receiving coins from downloaded games lately, after play. Need new countries and add more coin rewards from daily challenges, challenge. In all, a great game. 🎮', 'Good game. I\'ll give it 5 stars if you let us set up the button layout however we want. Allow us to place the attack button on the left side of the screen like we were able to in DT 1. Why do you refuse to do that? Please implement this :( Replying to your reply (Dec 27): I know that. I\'m asking why you do not want to allow it. Would it ruin your game? Back in 2013 I sent you an email and got this reply from Matej Vobornik: ""This issue is going to be fixed in the next update""', ""Love it. Best zombie game I've played yet. Not many ads at all compared to every other games I've played. I give it 15 out of 10 Stars!!!!! Awesome job to the makers of this game. 👍👍👍👍"", 'despite the graphics this game is enjoyable but this game has an automatic shooting I still enjoy either way at least there is a setting to change to manual shooting atleast and I hope they update this game please developers its now 2020 and you are not responding or updates or making new game whats wrong developers?', 'Really great fun game. I was just disapointed that I beat the story mode unknowingly. I had just started getting better guns. This game should have been more challenging with bosses near the end of each level. It was rather unerwhelming. Hopefully they update it with more mini games or make a Dead Trigger 3 with way more bosses and harder challenges.', ""Only early days, but game looks good - great even, One thing: I can't create my personal gamer tag!!! it's driving me mental. Please devs it does everyones head in when we can't use symbols and make our custom tags! Fix this please and you will get the last star 🙏 Thanks in advance! 😉"", ""It's an enjoyable Zombie game to play. However, after playing it yesterday, i woke up i got stiff neck and a bit dizzy the next morning. Good game. Unfortunately, after completed chapter 5, moving to chapter 6 there's no story mode. Hopefully new chapters will be available soon. 🤘"", ""It is so far the best game I ever played. It has graphics like that of ps4 and the story line is also good. the only problem is the price of weapons and upgrades the decorations is also far too costly to do . I have to earn for days to upgrade something and wait again for days for it's upgrade to finish"", 'the gameplay is good and the graphics is awesome but the wait time ruins it. i cant play this game for more than 5 minutes because a mission takes 5 minutes and than i have to wait 20 minutes for the next level!!! dead trigger 2 if you could just remove the mission wait time the game would be 10x more awesome. i know you did it bcz the game would be short but if you do this than nobody will play this. or at least makr every skip cost like 1 coin.', 'This game is very fun and addictive, i havent bought anything with real money yet but i am considering it, im level 27 and climbing my way around the world upgrading my tech to unlock more places. I would love the feature to play online multiplayer. That feature would make me give this game 5 stars. Thank you everyone who makes this game for making it as good as it is', ""In contrast to Unskilled, this game remains a great zombie shooter as long as i remember it. Plays perfectly both on mobile and tablets. Beautifully designed controls with level design and guns (good variety without the ridiculous kids' stuff). Great 60fps performance. Dynamic, smoking and full-gore zombie-smashing gameplay. And even though it has no PvP content - its not a problem at all. Better not fix it, than turn it into another abondoned broken game."", 'Great game TBH, the graphics, controls and UI is just awesome, kudos to the development team 😁👌 Also, could you please integrate multiplayer with voice chat into the game, that would be a huge improvement. Thank you.', ""This is one of the best zombie shooting game I've been played, but what I find annoying in this game is the dialogues of the character are big and near the crosshair. When the zombie entered the crtical area, the big letter just appear and flashing and blocked the crosshair. This is just ruined the experience of the game. Please move these letter somewhere else please. Thank you."", ""Greatest game ever!!! Thanks so much for fixing the problem i had with it!! I appreciate it so so much!! Your team responded in a timely manner n got it done asap and thats a great team for you!! Shows they aren't playing around and show that their customers are their number one priority and thats how a team and company should run!! A+ in my book 110% all the way!!! Thanks so much Madfinger Team!! Truly appreciate your help and support!!! Should be the only 6 star game!!!😃😃😃"", 'Just started playing, on level 20 and I love it!! Not to to hard, very addictive and exciting!! You can pick your own missions to make money, in other words, you can always pick one your good at!! The only thing that makes it go slow are the upgrades, little ones takes minutes big ones take hours!! Really enjoyable!!', 'The game is awesome but when i had to shoot i didnt know how at first then i got the hang of it then i had to duck under and go under the gate i didnt know how so all i am saying is before the whole game starts PLEASE put INSTRUCTIONS next time but the game is really really really fun', ""I never care about graphics however they are worth noting in this game, the gameplay is quite engaging and feels like I'm playing a console zombies game (I'm not naming any of them here but you all know which one I'm talking about) I'm on Chromebook too and it's multiple gamepad support is great, I can use wasd and configure the controls to my liking"", ""A follow up to the first one. Played this one on iOS back in the day just like the first one, amongst a sea of average free-to-play mobile games who flood you with ads every few minutes with mediocre gameplay, this is one of many well made games that doesn't push ads all up in your face. Amazing just like the original."", 'I was initially happy with the game but gradually as u go few levels up and reach Tech level 5/6 the game gets really boring and as the game proceeds new challenges stop coming, this is really disappointing. I guess there is some glitch with the later part of the game.', ""This Game Stands Out more than any other games that are Zombie-killing FPS games, & Its just downright fun! (Skip ahead a year or so->) ...Right Now, Im downloading the HUGE update. It looks pretty awesome! After I try it out, I'll be back to update my Review! Peace Out! Review Update: I had to up my rating to 5 stars! As far as Zombie-killer FPS's go, DT2 is just by far the Best: There's Different Challenges & Tournaments for Gold. And The Weapons Upgrading and Lair Upgrades as well! Awesome!"", ""Pretty decent zombie shooter, all things considered. Pay 2 play aspects are minimal and restricted to getting guns faster or getting 'gold' guns which are basically re-skins but shiny. There are ad's but they're removed if you buy something. All in all, I definitely recommend giving this game a try."", 'Love the game. U make money quick enough to do upgrades but the time it takes for those upgrades is crazy unless u buy gold. and when its done u get nothing out of it other then weapons. Like i could see longer upgrades at higher tec levels but not at 6 like the game just started.', ""Great game!!!!!! Love it so far! Graphics are great story is great! Looks like a really long campaign too! Can't wait to get further and expierence the entire game"", ""I really enjoy this game. And coming from a person that doesnt enjoy mobile games, it means a lot. Animation is good, detail is good, gameplay is fluid. Definitely worth giving it a go if you enjoy zombie games. Try it out, and let's kill these z f$@kers."", ""This game is one of the few you'll ever play that is super fun and doesn't require you to pay a bunch of money to advance.

Seriously, don't miss it if you're any kind of gamer!"", ""After level 5, there's no point playing this game. It is by far one of the best but ends too quick, rather, prematurely! I'm on tech level 9 now, every continent is pretty similar. I just unlocked the Middle East, all the generic mission levels there are exactly the same as the ones in Africa. Boooooriiiing."", ""Game play is great compared to most games out there. Unfortunately the game only has 6 complete World maps areas for you to unlock and play. Game developers informed me that there are no immediate plans on finishing the game. So you are limited to playing what's currently avail."", 'Games a real cash grab played for a while and it takes literally days just to upgrade ANYTHING without gold which you have to buy, EVERY tournament is rigged, regular mission zombies deal 15-30hp damage, tournaments 250hp damage??!

The minigames are really good. The controls are werid at first but you'll get used to it. Decorating your base is fun. Every weapon is cool and unique. This game is a master piece. The only problem is the battle pass. I don't know if I'm the only one that doesn't know how it works. Oh can't forget about the Freakin' cool maps with good music."", ""it's good but the thing is it gets boring quick maybe you should add new game modes or make getting money a little bit easier because how hard it is in 3 mins you get like 3 coins like how is that so if you are reading this add a big update for that!! If you do you will get like 4 more 5 stars from from my other account wait I mean 5 more because including me so plz do this i bet everyone would like it."", ""I love this game, it's hard to get used to if your usually an Xbox or ps type of person like me, but it is easier than most games. The settings are adjustable just like one Xbox or ps so you can play comfortably. It's easy to work with and it's super fun, unfortunately there is a max level of 55 that you can reach, but fortunately it takes a while to get there so you can still have plenty of fun, even if you have reached the max level, you can still play the same games, but you won't earn any xp"", 'I think that this is a great game to play with friends, and it has a wide variety of maps, avatars, and weapons (at a reasonable price). However, whenever I enter the Battle Royale, the game just freezes. This has happened multiple times, and also the game is rather slow to load. I would really appreciate if you could try and fix this. Overall, I think that this is a great game, so thank you! 😉😉', 'I cant say how terrible this game has gotten. First of all, the one hit weapons. What the hell were you thinking? Oh yeah, you just want money, you dont care about the players who get 1 shot every time they spawn. And in deathmatch, players spawn right behind you and then kill you 1 second later. Theres no point in trying to grind because you will get put back down by players who spend money to buy weapons. Its pay-to-win and I dont recommend playing this game because you will waste your time.', ""Almost perfect game, a few issues: Players whom have a grapple gun make flag capture completely unplayable, perhaps lock out grapple weapons in games where they give too much of an advantage? And the bubblegum.. even if you're above it or around it, it still slows you down, this makes trying to avoid it pointless, as the hitboxes for it seem to be very cloudy. Other than that it'd be a 5/5, please fix if you can?"", 'Best game ever playes dosent waste ur battery. Good controlls. Very eaay to controll and if its bad u can just chane it and basacley its the best game i ever played and it so easy apart the ones when it starts to get harder but i can still do itand if this game was deleted i would have nothing else to do!! Anyways however reads this download the game staright away ;) and it dosent waste ur time and me and my cousin play it every day and we kill the people ;) and if u font fownload it ur stupid!!', ""So, about pixel gun 3d... In the past, you could buy every weapon with gems or coins, but now you can only win some of them (like 60 of them) anda whole bunch of event weapons. I played back when level 45 was max and you actually got matched with people with similar weapons or skill. Now people with level 400 efficiency weapons come in and one shot you. Which is total bs. And every one of them plays woth auto aim and the ones with max weapons who don't use auto aim are easy to kill. Fix it pg3d."", 'Its was a good game at first, its pay to win which would be fair enough if the tapjoy free gems worked but after completing it told me wait 2 days, its now been over a week and still nothing. Also if you watch a video at the end of a game for x2 rewards itll have already put you in another game by the time you finish it and then takes stuff off you for leaving. This makes it impossible to keep up with the people that put money into it and you end up being dominated every game by laser guns ect', ""I love this game, really. I used to play it all the time when I was younger and it's awesome to see that one of my favorite childhood mobile games has improved and is still going. People have said this game is pay to win or is a scam, don't listen to these people. The game never forces you to buy anything and it always give you what you payed for. You are NEVER required to pay any money in this game."", ""Terrible, I used to play the game alot, then the game got a rework to be pay to win. Unless you're too tier player, you will have to pay at some point. It's not like cod mobile where you just can buy skins that give your MINOR traits, but in pixel gun the average rifle will have you paying $3 for something that when you level up you will most likely need to replace, which is more expensive. This game is fun when playing with friends or on campaign, but they need to make the game fair for newbs."", 'I used to play a long time ago and it was great, it was fun and felt rewarding. Now i cant get my old save progress, and the way the game is now its just not as fun, i miss the old game with friendly chat rooms, there was nothing that seemed impossible to get or isnt overpowered. The game is ruined. They changed the format of the game and made everyone restart essentially and it is a brutal experience to new players almost forcing to pay to cut ridiculous grind times and get an advantage.', ""Pretty lit game, after the modules and all that advanced stuff lost traction. I still prefer the 2017-18 days tho, at least I want the old guns back. I only gave it 4 stars for the nostalgic memories however ive seen the game start to become annoyingly paytowin and I'm only getting along because of my grinding before p2w began. Really hoping they remove the stupidly high prices and upgrades because I really doubt new players would like the game and I'm also sure this is why all old friends gone"", ""I have decided to give pg3d 3 stars instead of 5 because of a specific issue that I've been having since the 2019 Halloween update. When I log on to pixel gun everything is going well... Except for when I go to collect my daily rewards, my game starts to lag, then the screen starts to look like it's being possessed by a demon. It literally starts showing random letters and numbers, and sometimes the weapons will glitch out and they show up on different areas of the screen. Please fix this PG3D!"", ""I love pixel gun 3d, don't get me wrong, but recently it's been getting SO pay to win, ever since level 55. Plus why would u add 10 levels and ONLY add 1 gun. Don't even get me started on the upgrade system. It is so broken and makes the game impossible to play without paying money. I'm level 37 and have aquired 6000 gems. I have spent 4800 of them upgrading guns and the other 1200 in the traders van. I have spent almost 100$ on this game and just BARELY gotten by. I hope u fix this pg3d."", 'This game is really addicting and it\'s also really good and btw, I would give this a lot of stars if you guys can like, Add a option to trade, And the game is not balanced, Like seriously It\'s just not balanced! It\'s not about the level, It\'s the loadout and gameplay, The feature for this, Is ""Progress Scanner"" It record one of the matches if you think you got better or the enemies are too easy, Then there\'s the progress, The progress counts how much your good at the game, Hope u like the idea.', ""This game is amazing and so much fun but I rate it 4 stars only because the prices on the guns are way to expensive I mean you can grind and all of that but still I think gems are a bit easier to get now. 1000 coins and more but you get like 5 coins in a match so that's gonna take a lot of matches all I'm trying to say is that you need to lower the price of these guns especially if the other players are free 2 play"", ""Dear PG3D developers... PLEASE add a refund system for the gallery. Since you can't even remotely test a weapon before buying it, it's really hard to tell if it's usable compared to... other weapons. Assuming this is read and taken into consideration, pretty sure no one would mind if there was a cool down for it and a limited time before a weapon can't be refunded, but I really like to use weapons I don't see and I'm constantly disappointed with what I get.Thanks for reading."", ""This game is really cool. I only have a few things I'd like to change. One of these things would be to fix the messages in the clan. Every time I'm in the lobby it says I got a new message in the clan and when I check there is no new message. This isn't a serious thing but I'd like it fixed. Another thing would be to make the guns and armour cheaper. I think they are a little expensive."", ""I think this is a great game because this game has a lot to do in it like racing and battle royalty.Also u can customize your character in it with the custom skin and there's a lot of events that happen like 2xp and 50% off on some guns but I think that they should make some more guns in this game but anyways I thinks is a 5 star game for that."", ""This game has on more than one occasion completely erased all of my progress and data, forcing me to start out fresh from bottom level without my consent. This means that all the time and money I've spent on the game is completely gone with no hopes of getting it back. The developers never address not attempt to communicate with their player base, even more so when the players are facing an issue and need help. Do nOT play this game, do not spend money on it, this game is a straight out sCAM!!"", 'This game is amazing! Theres just one problem, when we make characters sometimes the feature that makes both arms the same can be a pain like when you wanna make them look different. I could be absolutely wrong so please tell me. Have a nice day! ;3', 'The matchmaking in this game is really bad. Im a level 34 and i go against level 50 who can easily one shot me. With that happening, it is really hard to level up, get coins, exp, troph. I mean i have to rely on mini games and co-op which is not what i want to play all the time. Please fix your matching making system it is really frustrating. Update: now i am level 36 and it just get worse, now there is pretty much a zero chance for me too win any match except co-op and fort', 'Its have a cool graphics,so many guns,and nice player but the guns are too expensive.its need to be 1 victory=5 coins not 3.pls read this pixel gun 3D DEVELOPER.And also the GB needed is so high my memory is full now.And the skins is so expensive too and the upgrade.PG3D now is pay to win but i still play it pls fix this.But thz cause the updating is kinda fast i wish it could be more fast than now.But the installing is so slow and if its done it gonna repeat again and again every updade fix ths', ""The game is so epic and I love it and it's fun and I'm addicted to it not really but yea and it is so awesome and you should really get it because it's really fun and It is really cool and I love it and I think I already said that but it is the second best game ever and I think everyone should get it because it is like really cool And now I am running out of letters so bye."", ""A true classic. Controls are a bit difficult to master, but once you do, it's THAT much easier. I suggest a transparent pen for skin editing (to make bits of a custom skin see-through) to make nicer skins, or maybe a 3D rendering tool. Other than that, it's perfect."", ""Is still fun, though after a brief hiatus all purchases and progress have been reverted as if starting new. Many, many hours, and quite a sum of money spent over the years, now all completely gone. No response from developer when emailed. I don't mean to be that guy, but that's completely unacceptable."", ""I'll give it a three stars because it's good but at the same time bad because of when you go to team deathmatch I get put in a game where it's all ready about to end, and on team rumble it's worst because you get put into a team kind of average but on the other team it's over power because their trophy is 5000 or more and they have weapon the kill you in 2 hits (that's alot of because) (but, you get it right)"", 'Its good but glitchy. Like, really glitchy. I cant even play the game most of the time because it just kicks me off and sends me back to my homescreen or the screen just turns black and freezes my whole phone. I dont think it is play to win, but maybe thats just me. All and all good game but the glitching is AWFUL. Also, if it is just my phone model, I own a Motorola e5 play by Lenovo.', ""This game used to be nice and balanced and now it's here to take your money and thats what it did to me.I have spent over thousands of money on this game and it was completly pointless.Today I went in to the game and realised I had over 300 gems and then I went to go check out the traders van and saw the pet dragon which I had already bought and went to check how much it costed for the skin and then it took my gems away and bought a dumb skin that can't even improve my gameplay.I want a refund!!"", ""This game was a four star before but the new update screwed it up . First , they made the ' predator ' gun fire way slower and make that amazing 650$ shotgun lose thee fast firing ability that allows me to hit more enemy easier . Second , the new map is totally unbalanced because the team that spawns on the island ( not spawning on the ship ) would just constantly jump on the trampoline and camp on the bus . I hope this game's developers can do something about these problems."", 'this is a cool game just why in death matches and duals you always play with people that are higher levels than you and they always have better weapons. So you can fix that and make us play with people in the same tornument or with people with the same level. Please fix this it makes death matches and duals not fun. This was my feedback', ""Coming from experiencing the original, this is a total waste of time. Short of investing over $100 you'll be curb stomped your way to gold then have about an hour of fun before you're curb stomped again. Unless you're planning to invest money or 30+ hours a week this isn't worth the space you give it."", 'It\'s so f****** hard! and so f****** laggy! fix the goddamn game now! and why did you get rid of ""sword of Shadows"" Out of Armory!!! I\'ve been trying so hard to get the sword! And not enough payments! >:(👿👿 And in campaign mode it\'s so hard. world 3-5 it has to meany bad guys 30 is too much! 20 or 15 should be enough! And the healing staff! I\'ve been spending the last 2 hours To get it!!! I have $573 and it cost $455 -30% off! I should be able to have it! This game makes no sense!?😡😤', ""Fix your goddamn game!! When you rent the weapons for 3 matches but you don't use that gun in those three matches it still counts that you used it. so i lost a good gun not even using it in three matches. i was gonna play with that gun later but no it had to be like that! But overall this game is awesome!!"", ""One of the best games I've played I'm my life but they need to lower the limit of stars you have to get in campaign and they need to give you a free gun when you get level 65as a prize for working hard developers if you read this good job just try to think about the stuff I said that need to be in the game like a free gun when you get level 65"", ""Its It's 2 cool with the guns. And everything and the graphics are so cool. You get me I love this game. It's all about guns Pixel Gun 3D the most number one. Shooter game I've ever known in my life. So yeah, I don't know what you guys think but I stay with the upgrading guns is too good. I love this game. It's so cool. I wish. You guys could updated. To make like unlimited guns in this game. Grease, can they do that? Please and give everybody 65 level account. And all guns please pretty please."", 'I hate to say that these game really sucks why? You see when I\'m playing some optional games these really happen recently in the middle of the game I\'m the MVP then these bunch of stupid things just came through ""Reconnecting In The Room"" I waited for a minute then suddenly my statistics got erased/deleted that\'s why I really hate these game and btw battle Royal game mode sucks', 'Good game, but they kinda destroyed it as far as clans go. There are unfair one shots and all that. I still love the game though. Also, we dont need more 1 shot area damages! Its so annoying to the actuall good players when people spam all the good wepons like aly wolf and offensive fireworks! And bring back ultimatum!', ""Fix your gameplay. I'm tired of losing. The guns in the current capmaign that look like rubrics cubes suck. I cant even survive the giant wave to fight the boss with full health and armor. What's the point of recruiting characters in campaign if they dont even help. I'm playing stage 5 on easy and I cant even pass it. If I was able to use my original guns then I could beat it but no you guys ruin the fun and give us those ugly rubics gun.""]"

But this one is an exception. Controls are great, graphics are great, sound fx are great, this game is addictive! Well done!"", ""Loved the game. It gets challenging with every mission. But there are some things that I'd like to recommend for the game. Number one, the missions should be varied, like a helicopter chase and 47 trying to fend off the attackers. Basically missions should be unique and have some sort of story to it. The missions are always at Montenegro and should have other locations as well. I'd be glad to see that happen."", 'The game was good but not worth the money. Needed something more. Like new locations. New targets. New missions.

Then only it is a good game.', 'Simple fun game with apparently ""one level"" only, it gets a little repetitive but it makes sense because this is a ""high score"" game repetition and timing are a key factor for this type of games. the sniper experience is flawless. My only complaint is that your score is manipulated, I remember having the same score for a few weeks and some days I was in the top 1,900 and the next day I was 1,075 then I was 2,000 then 1,050 all this changes back and forward with the same score 🤔.', 'Very fun for a month, with only one map, game gets really boring real fast since you are doing same thing over and over and over.

To be extremely honest, the game is actually extremely fun. Although it's really grindy (which is a style i like) to upgrade weapons and all, it really falls off because of the fact it's all one map. I want to see progression in not only the guns but in the actual mission itself. I want to see something in the background change, I want a new map, new enemies, new abilities so I can always find or discover something new. Doing the same thing over and over at a slow rate is not all that fun."", ""Sorry but I changed my mind. The game is way too repetitive. Every mission has everything but the objectives the same. Same guard and high profile targets pattern, same pattern of civilians. I don't mind if it happens in the same location but the game becomes very boring at some point. You just snipe the same targets each stage, it's no different than the one before it. Bullet drop and travel time are so unrealistic. The good sniper rifles are all paid, not good for a game that's already paid."", 'Really fun game(concept), but it is like a long drawn out demo with repatively laying out missions on the same small map scene. Could be alot better if there were large variety of map areas and more interactive gameplay. Eg. Possibly ability to change location during gameplay(even with staying a stationary shooter/ change location-angle) could be an interesting feature. Every level is basically the same gameplay with the same scene, it needs further objectives than score and kill type.', 'I like this game very much, just: please add more maps, and i want you to make that bullet view when you shot and you can see the bullet going through head or another body part of character that it needs killed.

All this ruins the game for me, which sucks cause its one of the best original mobile games, none of the other sniper games i tried ever came close to it, it just sucks the mobile market has to be like this."", ""It's very good and kind of realistic...gives you chill & literally exhausts you!!! But the one and only drawback is that it only happens in one place.You get too much used to it.You know every guards location,when he will move out or what he will do.This gives you and upper hand and makes the game easy and causes lost of intrest."", 'I would give it many more stars but having only one map and a stupid shooter zombie mode it soon gets boring. The characters walk the same route every game, so within a few plays you know how to kill everyone and in what optimal order.

But like many people before me have stated, y'all need to add more levels for both modes ASAP. Montenegro and Death Valley are good maps by design and what not, it just seems really lackluster to be stuck on those 2 stages for the entirety of the game. Especially when you're constantly grinding/farming for all the same bullshjt for not much different items. This has potential to be the best sniper game, hands down.

It only has one place. Sometimes the target is the same person. I was only able to play this game for 3 days only because of the game is so boring.

- Improvements to scaling and progression to help our new members along.
- Double Rewards with the Free Energy event. Keep an eye out for this one!
- Bug fixes","[""I like this game, but it gets frustrating at times. One thing I don't like about it is during the matches, you have to use a shotgun which makes you have to shoot big animals multiple times before they do down. Also, you can't use purchased gun in the matches, they force you to use one that they pick. To get the most out of the game, you are forced to spend real $$$. Also, a lot of the rewards are tied to watching commercials, mostly of the same thing."", ""Used to play this game 5 years ago. Can't imagine how the first version of this game was totally better than the current version. Platinum Eagles were easier to get, there was more consistency, and also no such thing as PVP. But now, what do we get? A bunch of unnecessary bullcrap. I realise now in order to get platinum eagles, I have to keep playing f-ing PvPs which result in many losses and I have to suffer from having to compete with higher tier hunters and too bad I'm poor.

It has some good graphics and it gives you specific missions and allows you to upgrade your weapon and purchase new weapons with in game currency as well as your own money if you decide to spend money but it is not mandatory.', ""Why does this game need access to my photos, contacts, make and manage phone calls? None of this is necessary to play this game. It also sells all your info and friends info to 3rd parties so it can spam you with junk. If you deny anything it won't let you play.

Also, there's a tendency of lining up a PERFECT shot, and then you go to take the shot and NOTHING HAPPENS!!! LIKE SERIOUSLY!!?? Or... You get the perfect shot and then just as you take the shot it lags and makes you miss. This game has me wanting to throw my phone at the wall. Too bad I can only give it one star, because I would go less if I could.

Just like other players are saying. Thanks"", ""I love this game, it has very cool weapons and many things you will experience. It may not be the best game for anyone but this game the you might at least give it a try, I've played this game for 4 years.

Its been so long ive been looking for a game like this, it has great quality and excelent graphics. It is a smooth and a nice shooting game. The reason i gave it 5 star is because my device is slow!

Please fix this and add some more guns and upgrades I will give you guys a better rating and the five stars."", 'They need to complete the story. The game is not updated with new levels or anything. The Arena can be more challeging with a bigger area to play in, and the limit on how many perks you can use should be left to player discretion.

But i played the part 2... There were so much improve to the controls grapics weapons... But what dissapointed me was afrer level 6 there was no more level to play... The same like the first 1...

Thus, this message it kinda like P2W game."", 'Its freaking cool and also add a space station map where everything floats and also the zombies i also suggest having an open world gameplay just killing zombies meeting survivors building a camp and all those good stuff and also to make it better add lan multiplayer pls thanks by the way about making this game', ""Fun game!

Plus it can be played offline!', ""Good game, good graphics. Stop being stingy though, missions get harder but u still get crappy money. And the gold..? Do you really want us to buy anything with it cz it's crazy hard to get and whatever wants to be bought by it is just ridiculously expensive"", ""One of my favorite mobile games hands down. I only gave four stars because of the new update. I noticed that it's harder to earn cash to upgrade weapons. And I'm playing this game for 4 years, and 1 more bad feature is that you have 2 casino chips for the slot machine per day which was 3 chips per day before. All of you guys did this to create a challenging game considering there's a radar for every player and pls. extend the main quest. It's so short. Still a pretty solid game. Good job guys!!"", ""Brilliant game, challenging but so fun. I know you can silence the music but it would be better if you were able to silence the sound effects aswell, as I want to listen to music while playing but all I can hear is gun shots and my character running lol.

Maybe you could increase the award for each match? I know that your main focus is Dead Trigger 2, but please take these changes into consideration and DON'T ask me to go to a link to ask you.."", ""One of the best, yes I agree. But the game still doesn't focus on a real completion for it's storyline, all completely focused in a continuous cycle, the non stop part does actually matter on this once, but players may get bored of it every now and then, it would be more fun if more things would be added like guns, maps, and etc, I know it's too much but the game is really great! I expect more in the future."", 'Great game ...wish it had a 180 button takes a while to turn around but the rest of the game is fantastic!', ""I am in love with this game, bruh.

Please guys piss off...."", ""I've played a few levels now and really enjoying this game so far. I can say some of these mobile zombie shooters could learn a few things from the developers of this game. Don't know about making video games but you all did this one right.

I'm sure I'll buy some items to help support but I won't invest more than $30 for a mobile game."", 'I love the game.

You can move around choose your next mission ,multiple missions available having unique maps and some unique zombies . Its not that hard to buy weapons if you are not set on buying a particuler type. you just need to kill more xombies before you exit game. Keep this type of game comming it will be cool if you control a small squad and all conversations and gunshops was in a game setting were you can walk around. do make a free offline war_shooting game .', ""Like the graphics but love the way that you don't need to be online or have any internet connection."", 'This Game is so Fun, it has amazing graphics. I highly recommend this game for people who like call of duty zombies. It is basically the same thing and ia as fun!', ""This game is awesome, you can't expect more from a 200mb offline game.

All this and more! Check out the full list of exciting updates on the MCoC blog: playcontestofchampions.com/news","[""I love the immersive gameplay and design and there are loads of characters to use. But the game has just two flaws, 1: the alliance wars and quests, why is it that if all of our characters are K.Oed we have to just sit there and wait for the war to end it's a bit frustrating. 2: you know the arena crystal? The one with the chance of getting the punisher? Yeah that one sucks, because all you receive is gold, EVERY TIME, 😤 it's infuriating and it really gets a person's hopes down. Pls fix."", ""Great game to play very, very time consuming. But one thing is if you want to get far in the game you have to waste so much time playing and kinda farming and playing more to get far and sometimes you have to spend money on this game from time to time to get some where slightly worth it kind of. But if you don't care about all that, then if you really want to succeed then you have spend most of your day playing it doing stuff to progress and you have to spend alot of money I'm mean alots $100's"", 'Happy player here! I have been playing MCOC since October 2019 (not sure, somewhat..) and I am addicted to it. The designs are fantastic and satisfying. I also love the monthly events with new champs getting release every month. I love the difficulty of the game, the rarity of aquiring new champs. I love all these challenges and that you can play for free without spending any real money. I love you KABAM!', ""Great game i have to say, but then with the hero crystal, i keep getting 2 star heroes and 1 star heroes, what's up with that!!? Super cool game though, and also, for people like us that dont have data, please make it more cost effective, and also, if you can, please add an offline mode where you can practice. Please reply to this"", ""Honestly I play quiet a few games. All different types. From slots to castle clash to marvel. This particular game is in one of my top favorites. I like it cause it's not a full pay to win. It gives plenty of upgrades to keep moving where you dont get stuck but the levels are pretty tough. It's a very interactive fighting games so if you win or lose it's pretty much on your ability to play. Overall great game"", 'I like the game,but it too hard to get any good characters without paying a lot of money.after almost a year and half and $2000.00 later all I got was just two ,six star character.i am about to call it quit because it just too much money just to keep playing ,oh and updates just keep coming every couple weeks,until your phone run out of storage space. You should get a six star character for keep updating, spending over $100.00,should be just as easy to get six star as it is to get a one,two star', ""This game raises my blood pressure. I deeply resent the luck-of-the draw mechanic for obtaining new fighters - I'm drawing at the 5-star level now, and of the nine I've collected, all but one is among the very worst champions in the game, as rated by the highly active online community. There's no option to trade or improve the game's bad champions in any meaningful way, meaning that if you draw poorly, the game's mechanics will require you to spend severely limited resources on ranking them up to improve, meaning you won't have these resources to spend on better champions further down the road. While the RNG is the worst factor, it's still a fairly mediocre game in other regards. The fighting is bland and repetitive. The art feels like it should be better, for a game based on comics. The one stellar element of the game is the animation rendering - if there's a prettier fighting game app, I haven't seen it. If you're into guilds, you may enjoy the game's Alliance feature."", ""Very fun game but do not give them your credit card info. I was charged $50 for some reason and they will not even communicate with me about what I was charged for! I've done some research and it seems they often keep credit card numbers on file and charge fraudulent charges. Then if you dispute it they lock important game features. When I contacted support for help they immediately close the case. No communication, no explanation. Completely unprofessional."", ""I haven't been playing this game for long, but from what I've seen it is very well made. I love Marvel, and the game itself doesn't take up much space. When I first started the game, the storyline was quite confusing, and not truly straight forward, and storylines are always a big part of the game to me personally. As I played more the storyline became clearer, but not all the details are straight forward to me yet. This is a highly recommended game if you want some action and good controls."", ""Support is horrible. Returning player from almost 5 years ago and they erased my name and won't let me create a new one, so that means no friends list or allegiance. When contacting KABAM their automated response system tells me it can't verify that I'm me!?? What's the point of playing if I can't even add my friends on here??"", ""Don't bother with it their customer support it garbage. My account was hacked (as was the email associated with it) so I needed to get the email changed. They expect me to know the exact date from 5+ years ago I created the account and despite me giving them a ton of personal details only I would know, like my bank into, they are not budging. All they do is send generic responses back and don't actually help. Won't bother with any of their games again"", 'Just started the game approximately 4 hours ago, unlocked high level heroes out the gate, decided to spend a few bucks and get the 3 star deadpool pack, got offered to create a KABAM account for a free crystal, used Play Games to login and the entire game started over from the very beginning with no way to restore my purchases. Words cannot describe how infuriated this is for a second rate piece of garbage mobile game.', ""I'd give this game 10/5 stars if that was a thing lol Absolutely LOVE THIS GAME!!! Just a few suggestions hehe.. I think maybe focus on the most iconic characters and make them as good as possible_ eg. Captain America or Spiderman Classic, Cap is one of the most iconic characters yet his moves feel very simplistic there are a lot iconic battles cap has had with moves you can incorporate into his SPs etc. There are others as well. But thanks for your Hard work. KEEP IT UP YOU GUYS ARE AWESOME!!!"", ""1.You only get Champions randomly despite of the fact you like them or not. 2. Story mode can't be played without consumption of health. 3. Crystals for champions are rarely lately given. 4. Those crystals or materials are not sufficiently given to upgrade champions. 5. some champions have same ultras 6. when in versus mode there's a quite difference of champions power like your champion is 170 and your opponent is 470."", 'Amazing game! Cant stop playing it because of its awesomeness. Highly recommend it if you love Marvel or you want to get into the Marvel universe. The graphics are 100%. One thing that would make it a little better would be to add a mode where you can play offline so all of the lovers of this game can play it even more', ""Fun at first, but it gets to a point where you literally cant beat a character in your quests because the opponent has 'death immunity' and 'indestructible' so no matter how hard you try you cant win. Happens randomly with different events so it isnt even a regulated thing you have to overcome. It's just there to mess you up. Also the difficulty gets 1000x more difficult after the 3rd chapter so you can only advance if you spend money or spend 8 hours a day farming catalysts."", ""This game is the most wonderful ❤️ game I have ever download in years. But I don't know why if you are a beginner it automatically gives you some alliances which I don't like. But after all it is really great. If you download this game you will never regret it, the graphics are perfect, the marvel players, chatting with others around the globe, this is awesome. But don't forget it uses data but not much. I wish you guys can bring an offline place so you can fight with the computer."", ""Marvelous game. A must have for marvel fans. Plenty of rewards. The devs regularly update the game and release new stuff. There's tons of content and things to do and thousands upon thousands of people play this game. Although you can spend money on there, you can still be f2p if you grind. I've played loads of mobile games from clash royale to mk mobile but all have been taken off just so I can focus my spare time and a little bit of extra cash on this game"", ""The game itself and a lot in it I very much enjoy. I used to play a while back and I enjoyed it, and that hasn't changed. When you play this, however, you'll have to know what to grind; don't complain about not getting good champions after some time playing. After all, Global will usually give you a decent tip (Alliances, folks). You don't have to pay to get far, it just takes a little longer. A bug here and there, but nothing too raunchy."", ""I've been playing this since 2015. I may have been this game's biggest fan but I had to rate it at two stars because I've been trying to download the latest update for two days and haven't had any luck. And I know it's not my wifi or my cellphone network because it lets me do literally everything else but download the latest update. Please fix this."", 'The game is great but its just another mobile money pit and they will take advantage of you wanting to progess in the game. Lol Credits and things are over priced Kabam in no way cares about the people playing this game far as loot drops . Characters will be unbeatable and try to force you to use credits to progress. Rewards need to be better and it would be perfect', ""Do you like spinning slot machines that simply change to the losing/lowest winning combination? Everytime you play. Enjoy this game. You can spend hours and hours on this game but you won't get far simply because the reward system is just persuading you to purchase the boxes."", ""This is the best game in all the places that exist I pray that you make more abilities and skill for the characters in this game and make it so you can run around in the contest and hack into Iron Man's suit. Please don't be rude about my comments on this game , its a coplicated update if you do update the game those who dislike my thoughts I understand I forgive you but maybe you could it so you move around easier. Please answer, Legendary ninja~7"", ""Loading takes forever. I can't even play the game now because of how long it takes for the loading screen to finish loading, and every time there's an update, which is a lot of times, the longer it takes to load, so now I can't even play the game, and It takes about more than a half an hour four the loading screen to finish, and it's awful."", 'Great game. Similar to Marvel vs Capcom but only Marvel and scaled down for mobile (Fighting game with combos, 3 tier special attacks, and unique special abilities based on the specific superheroes/supervillains). Can Free to Play the whole time or pay to play for a slight increase in progression.', 'Marvel has reached a very high rank ! Congratulate those who created this game what i like about this game is the fact that they made super heroes exactly as they are in movies and i like how the idea was placed with the crystals that gihe you super heroes once again congratulations and i hope to improve little game graphics !', ""The game is great , it's fun and it's time killing. But the 1 problem I have is that it's really hard to gain good champions. It requires an absurd amount of grinding and by the time you get a premium crystal, it's a 2 star. If the chances were a little but better the game would be really good 😁"", ""Amazing gameplay. Support is pathetic. I'm level 23 and have only just needed to contact them. Spoke to two different people. They were rude, condescending, unhelpful, didn't listen to me AND told me I was wrong. And even if I wasn't they wouldn't be able to do anything anyway so I should just shut up and leave it be. Not impressed."", 'I have been playing this game 1652 hours over 5 years and spent about $750. It comes down to crystal pulls to progress. I earned Cavalier title and have spun crystals even after spending $ that are unable to help my progress, mostly losers. Buy something nice like 2 real consoles and several games instead. Buyer beware.', ""Playing it for years now ,I noticed for a few months and now again ,when I lose connection and I log back on 50% of my health is gone ,I need feedback asap or I'm going back in time to 2016 and continue DC's injustice ..I really enjoy this game but that one issue is truly frustrating"", ""This game is so Rig and the developer is a bunch of know good people's, because they don't let you get to unlock your champions, and because of that you cannot Rank them up, which makes it hard for you to win the fights. It's time for y'all to di better with this game and stop giving people 1 star and 2 star only they're useless."", ""I think that overall, this is a pretty solid game with great graphics for a mobile game. The controls are simple but allows for sufficiently developed combos, and allows for you to have to develop a skill for fighting. I've been playing for three years and I have enjoyed this game the entire time I've played."", ""EDIT: Since the game is running smoothly, as promised, I'm changing my review and giving this game 5 stars because it's very entertaining although there are things to improve. ------------ Since the last update I have to restart the game 2-3 times before having my first battle because the game crashes. Sometimes it recovers the battle I was about to have, but most times it doesn't even do that. I like the game but this issue is getting very annoying. Please fix it and I'll increase the rating."", 'This game was fun, still kind of is. They keep ""fixing"" problems but make even more when doing so. I understand that money must be made to keep the game going but now it is all about greed. They allow people to make multiple accounts and use ""bots"" to collect as many units as possible, so they can sell gifts (during event) at half the price equal units would go for. Then join alliances so said alliance can boost their event score. If you want to try the game, do NOT spend your real money!', 'The gameplay and moves are the best I\'ve ever seen for pvp multiplayer and single player Graphics could use some updates and maybe a free crystal. I really like the character called ""White Tiger"" from The ultimate spider-man series... Also there should be better rewards for perfect wins... Where ur character hasn\'t been even touched by another character or when health of ur character is 99%.', ""This game has gotten worse over time, I mean like (GAME OF WAR) bad. Lol At this point I play out of boredom and maybe to see a new character. Telling the app maker your issues doesn't solve anything. So my advice if you decide to play, is to never spend a dime on the game and don't get into it too much. 12-22-19 update, this game still is a POS. The only upside is playing with friends and seeing new characters. You really have no control over the game, when they want you to lose, you lose."", ""I love this game. I play it all the time. And to reply to RayanQuickRats, you can fight other people in alliance wars. I do have one problem though. And that's the Arena Crystal's. Every single time I buy one, it gives me gold. And I've most likely bought 100 in my entire time of playing the game. If you can increase the rate of landing on punisher, I'm pretty I'm not the only one with this problem, but that would be great. Outside of that this game is great."", ""I've been playing this game since I was in 2nd grade, it is a great game because you could collect characters and use them in quests , battles, and you can go through the events and versus modes with them. You could power up and gain more champions with iso-8 and crystals which is a fun addition to the game making you available to be better than others stat-wise. I never lost fun and interest in this game and it is incredible. So for me in my opinion, I would download this game immediately :>:>"", 'I enjoyed the game and the graphics, It wasnt as good as injustice two but had way more characters. I think that it is very hard to get 4 star heroes and above because they just want your money. But I like the game style and their is almost a different ability for each hero. So I think that you should get it, but dont play it alot it you dont want to spend money', 'I have played long enough to acquire the title ancient one 4 year old account. This company is a joke. I spent actual $ to revive my fighters & immediately after I healed them back up the game goes down for emergency maintenance. This happened as I was waiting for the fight to load in alliance war. When I was able to log back in my fighter was dead and the $ I spent to revive & heal was wasted! I contacted customer service & later an email saying there was nothing they could do?

You can have a mirror battle where u and the computer have the same character same lv and for some freaking reason he has more health and damage.', ""Best mobile game I've ever played, been playing this for years - one of the first apps I download on new devices... awesome game modes for variety and so much to play around with on you team with the characters, the way they all have different combos and different fluidity in/out of special moves, various effects, loads of gear to equip, team passives... I could go on, but why ruin the surprises! Truly awesome game, thank you! ....oh, and you can grind, so there is NO PAY TO WIN!!"", ""Awesome game I really enjoy playing it.. But the online battle is impossible to play.. I face very powerful opponents with no chance of winning.. And the breakthrough ain't favourable.. Gradually am losing interest in the game ifthe above mentioned faults are not fixed.."", ""Many years ago I would have killed for this game. Now,not so much. It's freaking hard to get characters you like as powerful as you want without paying real money, and it's a bit laggy too. Maybe if it was a bit fairer, a lot more people would be happier."", 'Im playing this game for 4 years or so, no big problems. But now Im stuck in the tutorial. And because of this I cant play the challenges or the survivor mode anymore. It is really frustrating. I tried to reinstall it but the problem is still there. Please fix.', ""I think this is a great game, but has problems. When i froze someone with green arrow, they can still block for some dang reason. And when i do a blockbreaker attack, they can still block. One thing WB should add to the game should be another nth metal slot on the survivor mode spin wheel. It is almost imposible to get nth metal if you don't grind in online battle for the nth metal. WB should also update the game to not crash. It doesnt crash on android, but it does on apple and galaxy devices."", 'Why should this game have to be able to access my contacts, know my location and manage phone calls to let me play the game. I have downloaded it in the past and it needed to know none of that. I have given controls ect. a good rating due to my past experience.', ""Love the game, I have been playing for a fee years now. Playing the past few days I've discovered that every once and a while, on the activation of Arkham Knight batgirls special 1, that when she jumps back, she might just do a random knee and no throw the batarangs.

The game is not being displayed fullscreen as there is a little area blank in colour white but thats not for the navigation keys I have already changed them to hide. Please fix it ASAP and if needed i can send you a screenshot through email for you to understand better. Thank you A faithful user', ""I'm giving this a 1 star, not to sound whiny but to warn people and also hopefully the dev's will see this. So my Samsung Galaxy a10e is fully up to date, running off of 5g wifi at home, and unlimited data. I'm thankfully having no lag or disconnects, as that's not my complaint. My issue is the crashing, it's crashing after fights in story and online. An what stinks is it acts as if u never finished the fight, in story it makes u do the whole fight again with no rewards. Online u lose energy."", 'Waited for weeks for breakthrough. Finally got nightwing breakthrough . At 12 aclock i accidently pressed breakthrough and accidently canceled . Gotta wait 2 months . Great. Im stoping playing this game. Thankyou . Many other player use hack while we play like idiots. So hard to level up.', ""My Injustice story mode is stuck on a tutorial loop and I can't figure it out. I've played for a few days and the game has been running smoothly, but I opened the game and my story mode makes me complete a tutorial every single time I open it, and because of that, Survivor mode and Challenges are locked. Please let me know how to fix this."", 'They will screw you out of purchases so fast if your game messes up. No support number to call either. Hard to find where to submit requests for support and they are slow to responding to them. DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME!', ""It's a good game for me specifically and it's really engaging at the same time. However, the only thing that I don't like is that everytime when I win a battle it has to kick me out of the app and have to re-do it again, which is a lot of waste of my energy. Probably that can be a thing that it could be fixed."", '(January 2020) - Same problems. Still not fixed. (December 2019) - Ive been playing this for quite sometime now. The purchase are too expensive for a mobile game. And recently Ive been experiencing bugs with the Flash (Earth 2) whenever his passive triggers. The screen goes crazy. And with Batgirl (Arkham) that whenever she uses her first skill, she sometimes just kick from a distance (so technically it does nothing) instead of throwing bombs.', ""Great game, annoying glitches. Had to uninstall and reinstall to fix a few game breaking glitches, and they got fixed just fine. During a double xp event, I grinding 4 characters to level 50 and got a good amount of credits and then at the end of the event some glitch happened and all the progressed disappeared. After grinding to get top 2% for a multiplayer season I didnt get my rewards. But despite all of this kind of stuff the game is still out weighs this, it's a fun game that's kills time."", ""Dont get me wrong, injustice is a very great game the problem is that every time I win/finish a match the game crashes and it makes me redo the match all over again, this happens multiple times a day... I've been playing injustice for years now and I've never had a problem like this."", ""The game, Injustice: God's Among us, is one my favourite games to play, on the phone and on the PS3 or PS4.

MPQ 196","[""I had left a negative review because of some unfair updates made to the game, but credit where it's due - the developers listened to the community and quickly made things right. For new players: The game is very pay to win and has a development cycle that I believe works against the game's best interest, but it is also highly addictive and very enjoyable. If you're willing to go through the steep learning curve this game is absolutely worth it."", ""Been playing for probably 4 months. It is enjoyable, the grind can get a little old in some events. But those complaints about regretting paying real money are redundant. Managing the characters slots comes with having to leave plenty to expire. Hence the temptation to expand to overcome the feature or to get OP characters comes to real money. It's a good game and fun. You just have to compete against play to win guys like the one who's spent $1,000+ then moans about it. Virtual roid rage."", 'Game could be better if more cards were given out to the players in the vaults instead of ISO-8 shards, for me and I am pretty sure a lot of other players have an abundance of them and cant do anything with them other than level up characters when we have extra cards to do so. An idea would be to create another vault to where we can spend the ISO-8 shards for characters so we as players can reach the full potential out of our champions, maybe a free legend during anniversaries if possible too.', ""I'm loving this game even after all these years! The graphics are great, the gameplay is awesome and the content updates often! Two thumbs up! I only wish we could select who our daily aid an ally bonus goes to like in previous versions! <-- Still waiting for some kind of acknowledgement on this!"", ""Awesome/fantastic. Now I've been playing for almost a year and the game just keeps getting better!! *Side note: Maybe 5star odds improved a little, I'm on about 1 out of 20 pulls since the update that brought shards, maybe that's intended, maybe not. 1 in 10-15 would be awesome!"", ""A great game for relaxing and having some fun. I'm almost a year into playing this game and I still love it. This game is still awesome! More characters continue to get added to the game world to collect."", 'Addictive, gameplay is fun for the beginner. The individual powers for each character is fun and the visuals are great, but missions get repetitive, some unique gameplay elements could be developed, and diminishing rewards over time make it annoyingly tedious.', ""There should be a safeguard against overwriting. I logged into Facebook and it didn't ask, just overwrote the new with the old. I lost my roster of 70 with many three-star champions. Sad day. Still fun working my way back up."", 'Game is great! So much fun, however they hook ya and get ya collecting. The collecting isn\'t very hard, not like you would think. The gouge is at how many spots you have. The ""premium"" or the rub is when you get good cards but you do not have spots to keep them. You want to keep them and level them, but without slots, you can\'t and the card will disappear in like 10 days if you do not buy a slot for it. Seriously, you will not buy covers. All you money will be on slots or inventory .', ""Worst, best game ever. I've never seen a game designed for you to not be able to play? It's an incredible game but was designed horribly to play. Very frustrating"", ""The latest update makes it longer to level up some of your characters. When you level up a character you get rewards. Every 8th or so reward was a comic that increased another characters power or level. Now you get an amount of points towards a character which may or may not equal a comic. Even though it is easier to get points it takes longer to power up characters. After you've beaten all the story levels it is significantly less enjoyable now."", 'At one time I would have rated this game 5 stars. However, since I started playing a few years ago a few design decisions have lessened my enjoyment of the game. I originally downloaded and enjoyed because (as a rarity) you could play the game a good deal without needing to spend money. The design problems- 1. Intro of shards - particularly for champion rewards. Makes the game more difficult to build a roster. 2. No new 3 or 2 stars. It is lopsided toward the top increasingly.', ""Lots of replayability. So many characters to unlock. Daily quests to encourage play. Team-based events and pvp. My biggest issue is the time it takes to earn in-game currency. It's quite obvious that the devs want me to use microtransactions: real world money to buy in-game currency. Sorry, I will not do that. Yes it would make leveling up faster, but I can survive without it. And even if I was ok with it, the pricing structure is too expensive. Overall, very good game."", ""Still love the game. Feel I need some kind of loyalty reward now. 😁 Only complaint I have is the developers are turning a bit greedy. In app purchases are fine but while once upon a time you could use your iso to buy just low-end characters, now all you can do with the iso is upgrade characters. All well and good but what with the one-star character drop rate being so high and my two-star characters being maxed, I'm sitting on 5million so far and nothing progressive to do with it."", ""While it is a fun game, it takes a long long time to get there. Team preference isn't even an option since you will be overwhelmed by countdown tiles and need a specific character to advanced without taking to much damage. You are forced to hoard everything because if you pull a cover you like, you may not be able to add them for lack of roster spots which are very hard to come by as you collect more and more covers. Yeah the game is fun... about 2 years after you start playing. Unless ur rich."", ""If you're thinking of starting this game, dont. There are so many heroes now you cant catch up to anything fun unless you play for a year or spend lots of real money on the bundles. Used to be really fun. Now there are so many push notifications and daily deals each usually $25 and up. Ironic that I spent more money on this game when I wanted to, not when I was forced to. This level of monetization is so blatant it offends me. I've played for 3 or 4 years and I think I'm just going to quit."", ""I just love marvel! The game is one I've played before but I find myself excited to collect more characters."", ""The game is great ; however, I would like to see more variety and artistic imagination displayed on your battlefields. Come on guys, you are Marvel and Dysney and it's just a background. Also maybe more interesting missions. Iso is getting old. Again you are Marvel and Dysney. The game could be so much better with a little bit more effort."", ""I love this game, this one is my favorite amidst the various games of the type. You can play for free, but it is ultra slow going. 5* covers are super hard to get and there are so many 4* & 5* characters that progressing a given dude can take forever. They charge way too much for everything and even paying money doesn't give much of an advantage because they are super stingy. Advancement takes tons of grinding. Good customer support though.This game needs a trade market so we can swap covers."", 'Latest patch rewards players with more shards for 4 star and 5 star heroes for both pve and pvp, which is a step in the right direction. Players need ample opportunity to accumulate shards. But developers need to fix how players gain supports- super difficult to get tokens, which are the only viable way to get them, only to receive a duplicate, and a pittance of red iso instead.', 'Fun game. Releasing way too many 4 star covers. Need more 3* covers released. Hard to build a roster with so many random 4*s', 'The game is very fun to play but extremely slow paced. It will take you years to get strong or spend ALOT of money to advance faster. The fact that you to pay to get hero slots is abusultly insane. Theres 300 +heros in the game and they give 7 for free. The rest u have to buy with $. To lvl up your heros you need ISO. You get very little iso from events and battles. Some heroes require up to 200k iso and each battle gives you 70 to 140 iso. If you play daily you will be lucky to gather 5k a day.', 'Developers are doing well with the updates. The rankings still need modified to feel more competitive with other players. Also would be nice to change prologue tab to events just for 1 2 and 3 * characters. Thus would allow developers to create other characters without expanding the star player more. Also,the new outfits are a nice touch, like to see them add the outfit to the awards as players level up.', 'Its an alright game. Typical of what youd expect: level up through long hours of game play or buy your way to the top. Story line is good but repetitive. New characters are constantly introduced but you are left to spend money to buy space in your roster or play enough to earn in-game currency to buy the space which takes alot of time. Ive played it for 4 years and only have about 60% of the characters available. Debated about keeping the game or letting it go... neither here nor there honestly.', ""The grind for ISO is beyond ridiculous. 375,000 to level a 4-star from 70 to 270. The casual player stands no chance. Now with getting shards instead of covers the casual player is lost. Maxing out a 4 star should at most take three times what it takes to max out a 2 star. 180,000 That's still ridiculous but it's more realistic. As far as 5 stars go... That's a joke... FYI I have all 2, and 3 stars maxed, half the 4 stars. Been playing for 6 years with 700 days of logins. Again ridiculous"", ""Great game hard at first, check online for guides and have fun. It's worth it."", ""It's a fun game with a good combination of luck and strategy. Without paying it moves really slow but once you get going it's rather enjoyable"", ""I love this game, have since I first started playing 5 years ago. I have had a few devices and this is always the first game I download. I have dropped quite a bit of actual money on the game and feel I have gotten my monies worth. . If there was a higher chance of getting 4* covers I'd give a 5* rating. The shards are a good way of adding the ability to champ a 4* however I think that the 3* cover awards should still be available as they were before shards. Mostly satisfying. Excellent Game"", 'This game is so much fun. Very fun, can play at work because theres no time limit on turns lol. One glaring downside is how you need to basically pay to increase your roster size. Meaning you routinely have to sell rare champs or shell out money before the cover expire. Aside from that its a great Marvel Themed time waster. Simple mechanics but complex synergies and abilities', ""Update: they've updated the compensation for the changes, I'm not 100% sold on the shards update but I'm never been that lucky with LL pulls for 5* anyway so it's not toooo much different for me. Would like more story events rather than rehashing the same ones over and over, but at least there's always something going on."", ""Fun game. Love the animations and story. Love the collecting part and don't even mind paying a bit to get ahead. But it only works offline! As someone that travels a lot and spend a lot of time on planes, this is ridiculous! What aspect of this game could possibly require access to data at all time?!"", 'A fun game and greater franchise handicapped with pay to play, pay to win, and extreme insistances of in-game purchases and the like: without the ability to just play and catch up to others whom pay. I would much rather pay 50$ upfront for a title for full access and see the puzzle quest series continue to expand into other universes than have it decompose further into such a money-grabbing mistreatment of the franchise.', ""Absolutely love this game.......but....bring back the old champion level up system. The new one sucks. We used to get a free cover of another toon ( occasionally)and now we get a percentage of a cover. Which is just ridiculous and a blatant cash grab. I used to love the champions system. Now it sucks. Thinking of deleting a game I've been playing for years. Now that you messed with something that wasn't broken."", 'I jave to say it is a great game thus far. The story is interesting. There is always an even going on. Two issues i have is the pvp isnt matched up well at all. My guys are level 30 or so and im put up agains level 100 people. Very unbalanced and needs to be fixed. And the pay option definitely needs to be a little more balanced as well. You run out of recruiting space quickly. If you want to use them you have to buy slots. A little more bang for the buck would be better there.', ""Unbelievable. A high-end mobile game that's still possible to play without spending tons of money. No spam-like offers, ads, or annoying endless lists of videos to watch or other games to play to get X tokens. Sure, if you want many character slots you'd better spend some $, but there's simply no comparison to other cash grabs. You don't have to bother with the various purchase options unless you really want to. Take your time. Very professional and surprisingly deep. Playing since 2014."", 'Best ""free to play"" game on the market. Great fan support. Constant updates. Great puzzle game with RPG elements. At higher levels, character choices and team combination make a huge difference in gameplay. This adds a level of strategy not found another Match 3 style games. Game replayability is one of the highest I\'ve ever seen. It\'s been a constant on my phones for 5 years. Highly recommended.', ""Finding it hard to collect gold coins, to allow more marvel team members to add to my roster. Didn't think this out thoroughly enough, did you? By the time the month is over, I still got eight in my roster, and no free characters or coins or options."", ""Okay, I've been playing the game for several years now ( on and off ) and I think it's really fun. But this shard update really is the last straw. With the removal of bonus covers, your progression is basically just garbage. Shards are tedious, grindy and just another way to spill money from our wallets. I'll play your grind fest of a game but I'm never going to buy stuff for a long while till some changes are made. What a waste."", 'Former casual Steam player turned competitive mobile player. The game has been out for many years now, with new characters being released about every 2 weeks. The devs are adding new features to the game to make rostering characters easier, but it is still a grind. If you enjoy the Marvel franchise, Match-3 games, and/or looking for a game to just waste your time on, this is the perfect game for you.', ""4.88 Stars out of 5. Good game overall but it's PvP needs to be tweaked so you are not attacked when active in Pvp.... It's really annoying to come back from a PvP fight and lose more points for a battle than you gained in your fight, all by losing to another player or players while you're already in a battle against another player. You control your team in 1 fight, but in the other fight/s it's bot controlled and uses characters that you may not of used if you were in control ...""]"

ⓒ 2020 MARVEL","['I really liked the game. Every thing is good and nice except for the graphics(eg: when iron man moves, the machinery that you can see moves. Like you can see it near the arm). The game has also lost its fun factors after the recent update. Earlier in the story mode, you were free to select your team, but now, you are stuck with iron man, captain America and black widow. Maybe you could remove this.', ""2 years ago, this game used to be considered as one of the best online mobile games. I'm really sad and disappointed at the poor direction the game is heading to, especially with its most recent updates. In terms of character & game design, this game is brilliant. Sadly, not much can be said about actual gameplay. The developers need to plan updates carefully before releasing them and should make sure these updates involve meaningful changes involving gamemodes, not just boring repetitive ones."", ""This used to be my favourite game ever. I played for hours every day. But then the updates started changing and I stopped playing often. I maybe started playing about 2 times a week for about 10 minutes. It started to get worse so I deleted it for a while and download again today and my god. They have absolutely ruined everything in the game. I'm not mad, I'm just disappointed. Oh wait never mind, I am mad. Just make the game good like it used to be, then I'll be back. Please,😔 Goodbye......"", ""Its a very nice game , i enjoy it playing. But the game won't let me connect to my Facebook account, whenever i click on connect to Facebook button instead of showing log in option it shows forgot password and creat new account page. Please fix the issue as i could not connect to my friends. Edit:- Thank u guys for resolving the Facebook login problem. 5 stars from me. Have a great day."", ""One of the few F2P games that actually gives away items to keep loyal players interested and able to keep up with P2P players. The developers are more than generous and if you're patient, the daily gems stack up fast! It's very possible to gain just about everything in this game if you put the time in and that's not saying one has to put in a ton of time. However, as with all things, there are ways to pay and get things faster but it doesn't impact the PvP aspects much."", 'Decent game but not free to play. You need to spend about 30 dollars a month. But reason for my low score is that as of a patch about 3 months ago the loading screens on several game modes went from 20 to 30 seconds to 2 to 5 minutes. This makes the game extremely annoying to play and I am calling it quits after waiting several months for them to fix.', ""Improvements need to be made to all the game modes. As it stands now we have 200+ characters in game but literally no where to use any of them!!!!! It's gotten to the point that the characters are the only content in the game that is really worth experiencing. Please allow us to use our characters in meaningful game modes with good rewards."", ""They completely destroyed the game with the 5.8 update. Players have been asking for new things to do for years, and all Netmarble did was nerf the top characters to make the existing modes harder so it takes us longer to complete them. That's not what we want! This is not a fix, it's lazy and manipulative. Netmarble only cares about money, not its player base, and I'm never spending money on this game again. AVOID"", 'Always disconnect from server. Come on!!! I pay for this game!! Fix it!!! It not bcoz of wifi. Coz its only happens to some character especially premium character (New review) Mode that should be improve is World Boss Invasion and Giant Boss Raid. This 2 mode always lagging and disconnect from server. Other mode so far so good.', ""This is (or was) my favorite Marvel game ever made, but the devs keep ruining it every update. taking away things I enjoy and replacing it with something I'll do once or twice and never again (ie. Story mode) I've spent a lot of money in the game which I never do, but they really need to start listening to players feedback. Make abx and alliance conquest better, fix the balance with older characters. Make bleed useful or get rid of it.. etc"", ""I've playing for a few months now and I love it, the character selection is constantly growing with the updates witch gets me excited to see if one of my favorites has joined the games universe. Only complaint is the character selection is small at the moment & focused more on recent characters but that's to be expected and I only hope that future updates bring more classic characters & costumes. The game play is also unique & fun in my opinion of course. One love all."", ""At this point feels like pure bait n switch, the changes to game modes and direct nerfs to characters after you spend money on them. Introducing rules then changing them 2 months later after ppl spend money....used to enjoy this game as of 2/12 update doesn't even seem like the same game anymore. Will not spend money on this game again due to these predatory practices."", ""What the heck is this new update?! The new way of playing the story is trash! You can't even choose your own characters! I enjoyed the old way much, much more. If you want to play a game where you do not choose your characters in the story mode and it has multiple modes this is the game for you. I only put 2 stars because this only applies to story mode on no other mode except legendary battle."", 'The game is decent enough but some modes are a boring slog or just broken and pay to win like timeline battle. But the one star is given purely for the fact the developers are utter liars and thieves. And just plain dont listen to the community. Example, i purchased something and never got part of it. I contacted support and they tell me their ""logs"" say i havent completed the content to unlock the stuff and received everything. Which is just a flat out lie. and they refuse to refund too.', ""Update 5.8 is terrible. It's a gamble game, everything is so random. I would prefer to spend 10.000 crystals to get the card I want than spend 670 crystals to maybe get a premium card or garbage. Please fix that, it's so frustrating. The same with CTPs, ccf drops, every chest, almost everything in this game is 10% strategy, ability and log every day, the other 90% are just luck or spend money. Luck is supposed to be 10% of a game! To play poker you need less luck than mff!"", 'After recent updates, the game has lost its fun factor. Most reviews have already covered the issues. One additional issue that I dislike is the removal of the option of one-handed mode. I can understand this being disabled in some game modes, but is another change in a long list of changes that have made the game far less enjoyable for me personally.', 'Tons of heroes, power ups/equips, and modes. Has depth, but the menus are terrible to navigate, terrible at teaching you even the basic or useful parts of the game. This game is complex and doesnt hold your hand at all, but while the system and mechanics being complex adds depth to the game which is great, the more complex a game is, the more advanced the guide should be to teach you. Maintenance times are long compared to other games I play like Duel Links, which is further irritating.', ""Please try to listen to the community. These new update changes have triggered a lot of players, go read some posts on the forums, people ranging from star agents , your big spenders to f2ps, complaining about the changes you've made by reading the patch notes. I love this game, but if you could just play your own game you would know. Nerfing the toons is worst. Even worse when the nerfed character is none other than Doctor Strange(most of them have ctp of rages). Please listen to the community"", 'New update ruins core mechanics of the game and makes it very unenjoyable. It takes away the hard work people have put into building up characters and makes favourite game modes unplayable. The so called improvements to game modes are not improvements at all and there is no changes to rewards which all players want. The developers are out of touch with the community and have ruined the game. 0/5 - Do not recommend', ""I have been playing this game since day 1 but every update, the gap between a whale and a casual player changes to point that it is necessity for you to spend real money, on top of that the devs even won't listen to the community, update after update the game becomes difficult making free to play players losing their interest unlike it once was. Good luck NETMARBLE, you'll going to lose a great amount of players in the game. Unless you'll reconsider to listen to what the community has to say."", ""It would be nice if you guys made an update where the new story mode & the older story mode were optional. This new story mode is not very fun at all. Takes to long per mission and your not allowed to skip those really long cut scenes. Also only being able to use Black Widow, Captain America, and Ironman sucks. I have all 3 of them maxed out but in stpry mode they're terrible"", 'Gotta say, downloaded this because Contest of Champions pissed me all the way off and off the bat 3 5 star heroes including one of my choosing and so many free rewards it was not only mind-blowing but down-right amazing. On top of that the graphics are superb, gameplay is fun, the banter between characters while you play is neat, and the story is quite good. This game surprised and blew me away great job Devs and thanks for giving us all the great free perks from the start seriously, thank you.', ""It's good game and has a lot of good quest. Only the last 2 or 3 update it's kind of controversial to the marvel comics fan and a lot of changes. May be the developer could evaluate more deeply on how to carried on this game to become a more accurate and fun gameplay, story, and character updates. Also, appreciates the hard work on adding new characters, but may be in the future you could be more accurate to the comics or at least made the characters more conforming. Thanks."", ""Thanks for the respond, I hope the dev team never do a things like that again. You should really fair, focus on new player and also veteran. In order to attract them you must make them feel comfortable with the system then they will have willing to spend. Don't trap new player otherwise this game will be death... And don't overreact to the whaler, I know they spend money a lot but without new player this game will not be expanding"", ""-This game is VERY pay to win,💲💲💲 -I dislike how some game modes/nodes are limit to 5 per day. That really sucks bc I wanna do more, in my opinion it shouldn't have a limit. -INVENTORY space gets filled quick and you have to BUY space, I have alot of things that are useless to me give us the option to spend gold to increase. Graphics ✔,Grind is 💯, rewards not worth it. RNG ALWAYS WIN!!."", 'Not as much fun as it used to be... The game has been TOTALLY changed. All the missions are very hard to play and the heroes have become too puny. I do not get a sense of playing a super hero any more but it rather feels like I am playing a a weakling unit. In order to make it through missions one has to buy uniforms and expend money because there are so many stars and masteries for everything that there is never an end to trying to get your character to a decent shape.', 'Really nice games including features , moves , and characters it felt so realistic playing it . The game is of large download size but after playing the game I realized that my this much data was not a waste of time . If you are playing first time it will be a bit boaring because of dialogues but then after sometime it turns interpreting and then more and more....... this way the game becomes awesome I love playing this game so much and can t stop playing it once download this must have part --2', 'I love this game but as updates are coming the game is becoming more complicated and difficult as boss are very strong and level 70 characters available to defeat them but to rank up character many resources are needed which are very difficult and time consuming to collect When updating a character from sixty to seventy many resources are needed which are very scarce and time consuming to collect Its my request that game should give vast number of black anti matter etc', ""NM, you all are constantly ruining the game with these latest updates, the new story mode sucks and it is hard especially since we can't pick any character we want to play with. NM, another thing that really upsets me is that ya'll have been making characters available in the shop by us having to spend crystals in most of these recent updates such as Taskmaster, Viper and etc. NM, rewards are too difficult to win. Please go back to the old original method."", ""The game is literally unplayable for me. I have this glitch that says there are files downloading, which the game downloads, unzips, then… repeats. I thought the new update would get rid of the glitch, but apparently not. And if you're wondering why I know the cycle doesn't stop; I've left it for over an HOUR to update, only to come back and find it stuck in the loop. Please fix this bug ASAP. I've been an off-again on-again player for almost 4 years now, and I'd hate to permanently quit."", ""Take my advice don't get it it takes up so much space I have a lot of space in my tablet I rated 1 star because it takes up too much space I get that they have to add it updates but still can someone figure out something that can lower the memory on the game like seriously why on Earth can someone figure out how to make a game which that can is high quality but takes up almost no memory k I have nothing against the game but can't Engineers figure it out please tell me someone can do that ok bye!"", ""I really enjoy this game style. This is the first MARVEL game that isn't turn-based, so I really enjoy this. Plus, there's the fact that you can change which character you play as, and let's just say that there's almost every hero in the MU. Very impressed!"", ""Tier 3 updrade is too difficult ... probably we need lot of time ...... a game in digital era must be not so long satisfy the player in less time .... genrally students doesn't have too much time to play the games ... at the tier2 I had to uninstall the game because I don't have too much time to spent with this .... I requests the developers to make changes in tier3 upgrade pattern...thank you"", 'I cant play story mode ever since the update. There is a time that im playingl story mode, then there is one mob that cant be killed. I exited the story mode and tried to continue but it always goes back to the scene where there is the stupid mob that cant be killed. Its always there forever.', 'after the change to the game modes the gameplay becamed more dull and boring. Most non meta games are removed, mods that allowed you to gather resourses like gold and tickets are gone to. This change made the game overgrind that i see no point because at this rate it will get closed faster then you can get all the heroes you want to the levels you needed.', 'Each update makes the game more and more garbage as the designers screw the players more and more. The boss fights basically are impossible as you do less and less damage as you should even with your most powerful tier 3 characters who are beefed up. The bosses are able to do random cut scenes which screws any actions the players already initiate. The bosses are able to do multiple one second kills out of the blue. You find yourself waiting for the game to even target the villians as you pound away at the keys. fail netmarble. fail.', 'Really really enjoyable. It never gets old. I really enjoy games like these because I love seeing how far I come when I sweep masses of enemies while taking virtually no damage. Really rewarding and satisfying and I recommend it.', ""Clearly made by fellow True Believers. 'Nuff said.

The problem that I HAVE IS THE FOLLOWING: The game is just a cash grab and the ads oh God the ads are the worst overall I give it a 3/5 stars', ""5 stars, I personally fight like this as well. And just playing this game of fighting another worthy opponent just gets addicting for me😁, like I won't stop until I defeat my opponent.

I really like this game because it has a thing that inspires me to make a game just like this!

After all these years the game is still good but only now do I realise this game was silly in many areas.

Still a good game to pass time."", ""I hate the fact that when you're fighting an opponent you just stay there for like 2 seconds which is enough time for the enemy to attack you and when you're on the ground it's like you can't get up like your character will not get up for a long time it's annoying but other than that it kinda suck but I like it a little bit I'm not a hater tho but it's super annoying this is for shadow fight 2 and 3 specially 4 I can't even begin to talk about 3.

Introducing Diamond Dark Fate TERMINATOR, the 1st ever mobile BRUTALITY, Diamond ASSASSIN SKARLET, a new brutally difficult LIN KUEI TOWER, and 10 new pieces of Lin Kuei Tower Equipment! Reach the top of the new tower to earn a Diamond Sub-Zero card and Kuai Liangs’s Scepter and Bracers needed to perform the first BRUTALITY. We’ve also redesigned the back of character cards, added a MK11 Stadia link, and crushed more bugs.","['Hello there, hope you are all doing good. I love the game, play it every day since its released, really enjoy it. However, sone of the challenges, sometimes, does not worth it. Lin Kuei tower, which just finished, seriously is not worth the effort at all. I finished it and the price is not what you expect for the effort, since the bosses are incredibly difficult to kill, need days, literally DAYS to pass them. Hope you can do something about it. Thank you, have a nice day.', ""Previously gave this game a bad review but I just unboxed the dark fate terminator and I gotta come clean. This game is pretty good for a free to play mobile game. The graphics hold up and the game has plenty of content. The controls are simple enough yet lack any tactical play. The in game store is a little high priced for a mobile game but to be honest I've never spent a dime and I have almost 80% of the characters. Wish they kept the sub zero tower around longer though."", ""The game is a bit tedious and works very similar to all combat games in a team format. Getting new cards is based on souls collected by completing tasks. Finishing moves are limited to Diamond cards and won't be given to you even if you purchase a Diamond soul pack. Happend to me twice. In Battle mode you may grind to a halt, as the game designer prevents you from blocking. In all, the game is gun for a short time but don't expect it to be anything like MK2."", ""I love the game, except for the difficulty of some of the towers. Every since I got MK11 Sub-Zero's health to halfway, I been stuck on 110 on the Lin Kuei Tower. It doesn't matter who I get. Six punches and my whole team is finished. I can't block ANYTHING from him. C'mon now!! I don't mind a challenge, but that's ridiculous. I can only imagine 200 on the tower. Also, can you get some new players!? Shang Tsung? Stryker? Sindel?"", ""Horrible customer service! !!! But other than that it's a very fun game my wife and I both enjoy playing, even though they are quite stingy with their epic drops. It is now a pay-to-play game,meaning if you want those epix you have to pay to get them you will not get them in the Lin kuei Tower. Previously you worked in the game to level up and never had to spend cash. It has great graphics it's easy to play fun yet also frustrating as you can't get the characters you want or equipment cards."", ""the game is great, it's pretty fair if you spend your souls wisely, I've spent a little money cause I wanted to support the game not because it pushed me to it and that it's remarkable good for a free to play game, highly recommend for F2P players who are patient and can set goals, Lin kuei tower was difficult but that's the essence of mortal kombat pretty good job from the devs on that challenge. Hopefully we will have similar challenges in the future."", ""Where is all the stuff I worked so hard for? I haven't been able to play in a while, and I finally got to reinstall the app, I sign into my wbplay account, and it still has me starting from the beginning. Also it will not restore my game data in the settings menu anymore. I used to live this game, but if I'm going to lose all the time and money I put into it, I'm just going to uninstall"", ""This game used to be good. Now you no longer can choose which characters to buy and you have to spend thousands of souls with a very slim chance of getting something useful. The Lin Kuei Tower challenge is impossible to beat even with the strongest fusion level X diamond cards, so don't even dream of getting a diamond Sub-Zero for free! It cannot get any more frustrating than this!"", ""Everything is well and good in this game but the game UI has to be improved, it doesn't start, it crashes though my phone has an 845 processor the loading screen takes a lot of time and sometimes the game doesn't start at all and during the fight it lags, there are a lot of bugs to be fixed and rest all the gameplay is very excellent, if you fix this problem I'll rate it 5 stars for sure"", ""This is a great fighting game and a solid adaptation of the console version. The graphics are amazing, and I'm glad they have special attacks for each character. My only complaint is that it is too difficult to get diamond character cards, and you often need to spend money to get them. Fatalities are good, but not as common as I would have liked. That is my #1 issue."", ""I absolutely love playing mk 11. The graphics and movement is fantastic. I've been playing for a few months now and I just want to suggest that you should have a spot where a listing would show people online playing and to be able to connect with friends and family for head to head fights and or tournaments. This would add another dimension of game play. This game is awesome and I hope you give my suggestion consideration."", ""love playing the game, been playing for almost a year now. after the last update it's been running slow, loading the game initially as well as pack openings. and pack openings are my biggest complaint. I have emailed on 3 separate occasions now. I dont see how the gold packs are randomized at all. I have maybe 12 gold cards that are maxed out. over the last 75 gold packs iv bought (150souls) I have got a maxed character at least 55 of those packs. other than that ridiculous issue, good game."", 'You know I really love this game, I really do. It has the controls and the graphics that any mk player wante on a mobile. I wish that you can add two things to make this game the best ever in mobile gaming history. Th first is adding guilds and making these guilds have wars between each other. The second thing is to enhance your story mode make a story of it keeping it like that seems dull, bring life to it. Thank you for your work and bug fixes. We ( mk players ) will always show you support.', ""Excellent graphics, the fights are very intense, I like the backgrounds when playing Im giving you 2 stars now, i uninstall the app because i have to record videos, and then when i erase all the videos i make, i have clean 5 GB of storage, and the same thing, can't install the app, what a great update you make right -_- Edit: installed, thank you for fixing this issue, you have my 5 stars now ;)"", ""I have played this game for five years now and, well it does suck that we need internet now, but at least it will let u play,.well not always there has to be a specific place that I have to go to in school for it to work, but rather than that, it is one of the most coolest games I have ever had thanks to my older brother that showed it to me, but anyways. It's not the worst , since well I now have 76 characters, and well I hope the next update won't be as bad as it is ."", ""I thinks the graphics, movements and everything is going excellent! But there's just 1 problem I seem to be having, I have great Internet connection I can play other games and YouTube but I seem to can't play Mortal Kombat. I'm not sure if your games broken or is it just my wifi dosent want me wot play, but still keep on your work on making MK 12,i hope to see even better graphics and movements! I'll be playing!"", 'This game used be to be so great when it was known as ""Mortal Kombat X"". Now, it\'s terrible. Not only do the packs have low drop rates now, but the character store is trash. Why can\'t we buy what we want anymore? Instead of choosing, we have to wait quite a long time for something we want to actually show up. I also loved being able to see my favorite character whenever I logged in on the main screen. Now we can\'t do that anymore either. I hope you guys will consider changing things back...', 'This game used to be great & fun without having to dump tons of money into it. Now y\'all offer challenges that you can\'t complete unless you have certain characters maxed out. The only way now to accomplish that is to spend a bunch of money buying souls to buy card packages that only give you a card you already have & have it maxed out. I just used 7,000 souls to buy cards & never once recieved any of the 3 cards that you\'re ""supposed"" to have a chance of getting. Huge waste!', ""The update for when some cards got changed to diamond lost my interest there. You can't promote any one you want. You have to wait for it to come out in the store. And I don't reckon some of the diamonds deserve to be diamonds. I don't like it when it changes rarity. Just really lost my interest"", ""A great game for a mobile version . I had played mortal kombat x at my PC and it was just amazing . I was expecting that the mobile version would be around 3 to 4 GB but you made this game under 1 GB. Its totally surprising and awesome . All around it's a great game ."", ""Its amazing just because of how the creator's make or put the right equipment or character in the game or like if your trying to get a character you need but its in the character menu where they have them for 450 or 250 souls an the card packs are great too but in my opinion getting a card pack is like saying im gonna win the lottery your never guaranteed a diamond or even mk 11 diamond so to me the diamond packs are a waste of souls but subtract that portion of the game an its really cool."", ""I've been playing game since 2016 the new tower challenges that have been released after tower of terror are way to difficult . Why spend hundreds or more when people can buy the console game for $60 . I know the company has to make money to support the game to a point and employ people but .. . Please adjust the tower challenges to be easier so more people can enjoy the game including me ."", ""Good storyline, but mutiplayer is so random, you are level 1 and you're gonna be put against levels 60. Really bad mutiplayer system. And I don't reccomend buying the packs, it reads DIAMOND pack, but you get GOLD characters, and you can't even claim your coins back, you won't get them. Controls response are really laggy as well."", 'Excellent and fun game, but 1 v 1 would have been better. Although I am disappointed that there is no story mode. The game is made very plain and when there is no story it becomes boring. I hope it would be developed and be similar to the ACTUAL console game.', 'I WAS enjoying this game for a long time...until I had to use a new Android for it. All my progress, GONE. And WB Support was utterly useless. Now I have to start from square one with crappy fighters and no chance of getting back to where I left off. Thanks a LOT.', ""I came back and things sill the same... cheaters and hackers anywhere. I just played with a hacker called TonyPRO that already charged Kabal's Fatal Blow in less than 20 sec without even taken dmg. Guys, when are you going to solve this issue? It's annoying and the most phatetic thing to lose against someone who does not even know how to play. I can't continue playing like this, sorry guys, but you just lost one of your best fans. I'm out"", ""Edited review. Please please fix the login issue in this game. Even if the internet is running at around 20 mbps still then it becomes difficult to log in every single time. I have already made lot of purchases inside this game. Please fix the log in issue. I don't want to uninstall it. I repeat plz fix the log in issue."", ""The Game would be perfect, except it freezes as well as has glitches when you play it on smaller, cheaper phones, and not necessarily less storage-space phones. It also seems like the better I do and try to do, the Game will not let me. It's weird and odd. I also think I'm right and have a great point to what I'm saying, that must be why y'all have to keep on Updating it. Also, some Characters aren't as strong, fast, and just plain good as They should be, such as Sub-Zero, and Lui Kang. Daryl D."", ""The app needs grid internet to get started not 4g connection. It takes ages to load up the game. If you try 10 times, you will be successful once it twice, half my phone's battery is drained in loading the game. There's no way to track how much time is left to load the game, a same usual music with a hovering circle keeps playing. That interest and enthusiasm of playing is only destroyed at bootup We don't live to play this game only, when we get a call the app crashes immediately."", ""Good graphics, well-adapted game play for the phone, and not hammering you with ads. Unfortunately, over the last few months the developers have been making substantial, and ill-advised changes - fighting mechanics, new and interesting attempts to monetize the game - and judging by the amount of glitches, doing it poorly. It's becoming less and less fun - i can't imagine what starting out fresh is like now."", ""I really like to play this game. It has a lot of action with awsome fatalities. But the only thing is it's quite hard to get souls and there is very low chance of getting a diamond charecter from packs. I think there should be atleast one more way to get souls or the chance of getting a diamond charecter must be increased. Please work on it. Thank you"", ""DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME!!! The game is ridiculous. You can't block anymore. The AI immediately attacks after you've been knocked down and the only thing a player can do is wait until the AI is DONE. Lin Kuei's tower is a waste of time. Sub Zero will hit your characters 3 times each and you're done. The game is garbage. I'm out. Also, look at the % for the packs before you pay money. It's a con. You'll never get the players they're advertising on the packs."", ""I like the game, it has some flaws however I would recommend to many people.But a little problem that I have right now is that I'm trying to connect my game with my gmail account so my game can save. I played the games for.a year before but I got bore of it and uninstalled it but nownI wanted to play it again and my progress didn't save I have been trying to connect my new game with The WBplay center but it keeps saying that my account is invalid, I even made a new gmail account."", ""Game used to be great fun, even with all the money the devs try to get you to spend. Problem is one of their updates caused game breaking bugs for me and when trying to reach out to the support team I've been passed around from rep to rep since October! And now they just ignore me! I know im only one person, but they just don't care about their playerbase unless your talking $$$! Time to uninstall!"", ""*sigh* great game but the card packs are a bit overpriced. Its completely free to play, it's not too frustrating, I do well in it. These guys do listen to its players (as of today they are fixing some bugs that have been addressed). Please balance some of the characters, don't pair up a gold team with a completely diamond one. How does your matchmaking work anyways? It's not actually player VS player, so what's the harm in lowering prices and handing out good characters every once in a while?"", ""I really enjoy playing this game its my favorite game on mobile but it's really frustrating to get a diamond card I mean I open like 10 packs at times but still don't get a diamond I really hope on the next update you guys can make some changes atleast give us 100% to get a diamond card maybe for 800 souls or so that would make the game more enjoyable for the die hard fans"", ""Good game but I liked it when u could choose your own characters to purchase. I don't like wanting 24hr until they only give u 3 to choose from. it never be the character u want. Also they're should be some time when xp is double or something to help u build characters up. once they hit 30 it's extremely difficult to build."", ""This is one of my favourite games. I love this game. But i can't give it 5 stars because of linn kuel tower. At battle 40 you face sub-zero grandmaster. One problem is, if he uses hos ice decoy and you fail to kill him in the same round, he'll keep on using ice decoy, which is super unbalanced. I have been stuck there for a week because there isn't that many ways of leveling up. So i'm just stuck there."", ""Game is fun, but requires you to always be online. Which wouldn't be too bad if it would let you log in. Couldn't log in in 2 days now. Other online games like Pokemon go work with my wifi. This game has some really bad connection issues. Works on mobile data, but consumes too much data for my taste. So I cannot play it. Fix log in problems and connection issues and the game will be good."", 'I enjoy playing this game, the challenges and the characters. But I have given this app a 1 star rating, because I does not log me in, everytime I try to open it.

The whole design is to run you out of in game currency and then every action can be done with gold(premium currency). To play a level takes 10 tickets you only have 50 but you can buy a Max increase with gold. Also the DNA combining is really cool but each creature has a mutagen level that has to be full to combine. It takes forever through combat or you can use gold. Without spending real money you get no where', 'Cool action but this game is rigged. Doesn\'t let you get the items you need to complete certain missions. When you get to a certain level, the app will keep closing out. example if your trying to make an item. The app just shuts down.

Theres better games to be a whale in that appreciate your money.', ""This game is fun for about five minutes every hour, unless you are willing to pay absurd amounts of money. Way to geared towards a Pay 2 Play set up. It's a fun game with an interesting concept but the lack of free gameplay as well as minimal bonus opportunity make this game the biggest rip-off in all of Mobile Gaming, or simply the most boring and non-eventfull waste of time I've encountered.

ULTIMATE GAMEPLAY
Adjustments made for smoother and effortless gameplay.","[""Great game with lots of options.how to spend the time. 20h in and still plenty of gameplay left. The Versus mode is a great addition and I like that it's not extremely favored towards top players. ! BUT!- the lag,disconnects and no response from servers just kills all the fun. Buying cards or opening packs is a nightmare as often game freezes and nothing is given in return. Anything that can be done online is broken and will freeze."", ""I love this game so much it just interests me and if I ever get kidnapped or if I'm being bullied I can just use the skills that I learn on this game. Wakasashi hook, upper cut, right cross, left cross, jab and all the others. It's real fun playing this game I would shake hands with the person that made this game👍🤗🤗🙏"", ""Loved this game when I played it back before and during they implemented the keys feature.. Disappointed my game won't sync my progress from back then, I remember defeating zeus with zeus and it's all gone.. Please contact so I can Continue playing this brilliant game that had me so hooked as a kid, update: tried syncing and hasn't worked, it shows my fight rewards of 3.7m but I'm lvl1 on biowar"", ""I want jackhammer in the game. Can it be in spring and other robots just like last time. And summer because I'm board. I hope there's a new robot. And I realy new event I don't know what it called. I even got 5 star wildfire 5 star Zeus and 5 star Fraust. That's my wish. Thank you so mush for bringing new robots terror wildfire and zeroG. New robot coming soon in 2020 right? And another thing I'm really good. I play it every day. Well sometimes and I like to paint my new robot. That what I like."", ""I really love the game play the bosses, but let's get one thing straight in the movie Atom fought Zeus, why can't one use one robot for all stages. Then I'm having issues opening the superbot store in the event store. I can open the gold store and other robot store in live event store but once I click on the superbot store the game hangs. Please how can I fix that."", 'I feel like you guys should add back the original special affects like the blue and purple energy waves during rip offs and special moves, since in my oppinion, the gameplay looks really doll and plain with the current special and rip off effects. I will rate you a 5 star if you make these changes.', '5 Stars but I ran in to a glich. So I am playing the game normaly and I battle a strong bot. We both went down to zero hp at the same time, and my head gets cut off then I forgot to press the circles so he fell. Then it froze until I restarted the game.', 'fun game i just hope there will be more updates best game ive played whats the problem when buy a new character it glitch but its still good i just there will be more things to do cuz i allready beat the game love it glad not to much adds but its good game', ""I really love this game but the problem is the graphics and it doesn't look realistic to me it looks like cartoon please make a plan and it's so hard please just make a plan and fix the problems in this game but because I love the game and I played it all night I would give it 5 stars"", 'Been playing it for the last 5 years. Love it too much. Keep adding new robots guys and keep up your good works☺☺☺☺☺', ""Well, it was kinda good but the robots were just a little too strong when they get real damaged, like I'd thought that they would fight harder if they have more health."", 'I will still give this a 5 star because this is just one of those games you played before and just somehow find yourself in it again I had this game a long time ago and I had alot of stuff like atom but not Zeus but I re grided and somehow I got both atom and Zeus but yea this is just all out amazing game', ""I really like the game, this game, grow up with me when I was five I got all the robots and had alot of gold from grinding but then, my dad deleted the game and gave me a phone so then I got it on my phone and I literally can't play it for so much lag I just don't get it please help"", ""It's ok, I feel fighters should be entitled to more gold coins to enable them upgrade theirs bots better. Asking for too much money isn't too nice."", 'Developers, I have been playing this since 2014. The game is great and all but if you guys can fix the graphics a little bit the game will be perfect.', 'I like the game in all but one thing is mest up when i did the legendary chalange the mega reward is twin cities but then one the last chalange you have to have zeus for it and zeus cost gold and for me zeus cost 870 gold and thats 70 more gold than even better version zeus gold and gold is super hard to get you only get 1 gold each time you level up and that will take a long time unless you by gold and to by nere a 1000 gold it cost a $100 and literitly only poeple with a lot of monny can by', ""This game is amazing! I totally love it, it really reminds you everything about the movie and it's just amazing! Totally recommended it you won't regret a thing while playing this game"", ""Its a good gave with good graphics. My issue is that my items i bought wasn't giving to me. Other than that its a okay game"", ""I think world robot boxing 2 is a lot better then real steel world robot boxing because I can never figure out how to work the real steel world robot boxing because it's hard to control."", 'Best fighting game ever to be honest. Great detail, good bosses, and the best is the withdraw area. U can get premium bots out of them easily. I RECOMMEND it', 'A little frustrating. Game freezes when trying to paint and the game has still not given gold when doing the game downloads for the free gold option as well as watching a video gets you 1 gold coin and then done.', 'This game is my childhood, I really loved this game since it ever came out, and I still cant wait until reel steel wrb 2 comes out, please keep up the good work with the reel steel community!', 'I remember this games graphics were better and not like pixelated and blotchy sometimes but other than that still enjoy the game', 'The game is great but the only thing i dont like is the low graphics constant glitching. I own every robot and cant stop winning!', 'I love it it gives you so much fun for so long and there is more real steel games to play 😁', 'This game is great but it was too easy. In 5 days i reached WRBG and i got metro gold ☆☆☆☆☆', ""too much laggy ... and many bugs.. my phone's os is latest.. phone has also.. 39 gb of free space..."", 'I love this game im not going to lie im 21 and ive been playing this game for years i recomend it very cool robots it has alot of action and also go check out all the other games they made', 'Very addicting and fun game but i had to give it a 4 because of the lag. But you dont have to listen to me cus i only 11', ""I love it it is so awsome,even though the graphics aren't that good its awsome"", 'Very fun, and addictive started playing this a while ago and I have reached pretty far keep up', 'Waste of time, no increment to robots of unless data charges.time spare customer hacker.reward gets mixed up.', ""The game is great and all but for me it's really laggy"", 'This game is not that bad but the robots in the game get way harder to pass thats the problem...', ""How many times must MIDAS GOLD have to rise up his health in Versus Mode. I fought with him almost 10 times already and that DUDE rise up his health like 20 - 25 times per round. It's so annoying and boring."", 'I love this game, but is there a way to adjust graphics so everything looks better?', ""Fun game! I love the movie so it's cool to have a awesome game to go along with it!"", 'Its kinda fun but there was a bug it keeps on lagging and it wont let me attack please fix it', 'It is not allowing me to log me in to my old account, I just reinstalled it after years of not playing it, it has me restart the game, pkease help.', 'Worst game ever dont waste your time on this.

All this and more! Check out the full list of exciting updates on the MCoC blog: playcontestofchampions.com/news","[""I love the immersive gameplay and design and there are loads of characters to use. But the game has just two flaws, 1: the alliance wars and quests, why is it that if all of our characters are K.Oed we have to just sit there and wait for the war to end it's a bit frustrating. 2: you know the arena crystal? The one with the chance of getting the punisher? Yeah that one sucks, because all you receive is gold, EVERY TIME, 😤 it's infuriating and it really gets a person's hopes down. Pls fix."", ""Great game to play very, very time consuming. But one thing is if you want to get far in the game you have to waste so much time playing and kinda farming and playing more to get far and sometimes you have to spend money on this game from time to time to get some where slightly worth it kind of. But if you don't care about all that, then if you really want to succeed then you have spend most of your day playing it doing stuff to progress and you have to spend alot of money I'm mean alots $100's"", 'Happy player here! I have been playing MCOC since October 2019 (not sure, somewhat..) and I am addicted to it. The designs are fantastic and satisfying. I also love the monthly events with new champs getting release every month. I love the difficulty of the game, the rarity of aquiring new champs. I love all these challenges and that you can play for free without spending any real money. I love you KABAM!', ""Great game i have to say, but then with the hero crystal, i keep getting 2 star heroes and 1 star heroes, what's up with that!!? Super cool game though, and also, for people like us that dont have data, please make it more cost effective, and also, if you can, please add an offline mode where you can practice. Please reply to this"", ""Honestly I play quiet a few games. All different types. From slots to castle clash to marvel. This particular game is in one of my top favorites. I like it cause it's not a full pay to win. It gives plenty of upgrades to keep moving where you dont get stuck but the levels are pretty tough. It's a very interactive fighting games so if you win or lose it's pretty much on your ability to play. Overall great game"", 'I like the game,but it too hard to get any good characters without paying a lot of money.after almost a year and half and $2000.00 later all I got was just two ,six star character.i am about to call it quit because it just too much money just to keep playing ,oh and updates just keep coming every couple weeks,until your phone run out of storage space. You should get a six star character for keep updating, spending over $100.00,should be just as easy to get six star as it is to get a one,two star', ""This game raises my blood pressure. I deeply resent the luck-of-the draw mechanic for obtaining new fighters - I'm drawing at the 5-star level now, and of the nine I've collected, all but one is among the very worst champions in the game, as rated by the highly active online community. There's no option to trade or improve the game's bad champions in any meaningful way, meaning that if you draw poorly, the game's mechanics will require you to spend severely limited resources on ranking them up to improve, meaning you won't have these resources to spend on better champions further down the road. While the RNG is the worst factor, it's still a fairly mediocre game in other regards. The fighting is bland and repetitive. The art feels like it should be better, for a game based on comics. The one stellar element of the game is the animation rendering - if there's a prettier fighting game app, I haven't seen it. If you're into guilds, you may enjoy the game's Alliance feature."", ""Very fun game but do not give them your credit card info. I was charged $50 for some reason and they will not even communicate with me about what I was charged for! I've done some research and it seems they often keep credit card numbers on file and charge fraudulent charges. Then if you dispute it they lock important game features. When I contacted support for help they immediately close the case. No communication, no explanation. Completely unprofessional."", ""I haven't been playing this game for long, but from what I've seen it is very well made. I love Marvel, and the game itself doesn't take up much space. When I first started the game, the storyline was quite confusing, and not truly straight forward, and storylines are always a big part of the game to me personally. As I played more the storyline became clearer, but not all the details are straight forward to me yet. This is a highly recommended game if you want some action and good controls."", ""Support is horrible. Returning player from almost 5 years ago and they erased my name and won't let me create a new one, so that means no friends list or allegiance. When contacting KABAM their automated response system tells me it can't verify that I'm me!?? What's the point of playing if I can't even add my friends on here??"", ""Don't bother with it their customer support it garbage. My account was hacked (as was the email associated with it) so I needed to get the email changed. They expect me to know the exact date from 5+ years ago I created the account and despite me giving them a ton of personal details only I would know, like my bank into, they are not budging. All they do is send generic responses back and don't actually help. Won't bother with any of their games again"", 'Just started the game approximately 4 hours ago, unlocked high level heroes out the gate, decided to spend a few bucks and get the 3 star deadpool pack, got offered to create a KABAM account for a free crystal, used Play Games to login and the entire game started over from the very beginning with no way to restore my purchases. Words cannot describe how infuriated this is for a second rate piece of garbage mobile game.', ""I'd give this game 10/5 stars if that was a thing lol Absolutely LOVE THIS GAME!!! Just a few suggestions hehe.. I think maybe focus on the most iconic characters and make them as good as possible_ eg. Captain America or Spiderman Classic, Cap is one of the most iconic characters yet his moves feel very simplistic there are a lot iconic battles cap has had with moves you can incorporate into his SPs etc. There are others as well. But thanks for your Hard work. KEEP IT UP YOU GUYS ARE AWESOME!!!"", ""1.You only get Champions randomly despite of the fact you like them or not. 2. Story mode can't be played without consumption of health. 3. Crystals for champions are rarely lately given. 4. Those crystals or materials are not sufficiently given to upgrade champions. 5. some champions have same ultras 6. when in versus mode there's a quite difference of champions power like your champion is 170 and your opponent is 470."", 'Amazing game! Cant stop playing it because of its awesomeness. Highly recommend it if you love Marvel or you want to get into the Marvel universe. The graphics are 100%. One thing that would make it a little better would be to add a mode where you can play offline so all of the lovers of this game can play it even more', ""This game is the most wonderful ❤️ game I have ever download in years. But I don't know why if you are a beginner it automatically gives you some alliances which I don't like. But after all it is really great. If you download this game you will never regret it, the graphics are perfect, the marvel players, chatting with others around the globe, this is awesome. But don't forget it uses data but not much. I wish you guys can bring an offline place so you can fight with the computer."", ""Fun at first, but it gets to a point where you literally cant beat a character in your quests because the opponent has 'death immunity' and 'indestructible' so no matter how hard you try you cant win. Happens randomly with different events so it isnt even a regulated thing you have to overcome. It's just there to mess you up. Also the difficulty gets 1000x more difficult after the 3rd chapter so you can only advance if you spend money or spend 8 hours a day farming catalysts."", ""Marvelous game. A must have for marvel fans. Plenty of rewards. The devs regularly update the game and release new stuff. There's tons of content and things to do and thousands upon thousands of people play this game. Although you can spend money on there, you can still be f2p if you grind. I've played loads of mobile games from clash royale to mk mobile but all have been taken off just so I can focus my spare time and a little bit of extra cash on this game"", ""The game itself and a lot in it I very much enjoy. I used to play a while back and I enjoyed it, and that hasn't changed. When you play this, however, you'll have to know what to grind; don't complain about not getting good champions after some time playing. After all, Global will usually give you a decent tip (Alliances, folks). You don't have to pay to get far, it just takes a little longer. A bug here and there, but nothing too raunchy."", ""I've been playing this since 2015. I may have been this game's biggest fan but I had to rate it at two stars because I've been trying to download the latest update for two days and haven't had any luck. And I know it's not my wifi or my cellphone network because it lets me do literally everything else but download the latest update. Please fix this."", 'The game is great but its just another mobile money pit and they will take advantage of you wanting to progess in the game. Lol Credits and things are over priced Kabam in no way cares about the people playing this game far as loot drops . Characters will be unbeatable and try to force you to use credits to progress. Rewards need to be better and it would be perfect', ""Do you like spinning slot machines that simply change to the losing/lowest winning combination? Everytime you play. Enjoy this game. You can spend hours and hours on this game but you won't get far simply because the reward system is just persuading you to purchase the boxes."", ""This is the best game in all the places that exist I pray that you make more abilities and skill for the characters in this game and make it so you can run around in the contest and hack into Iron Man's suit. Please don't be rude about my comments on this game , its a coplicated update if you do update the game those who dislike my thoughts I understand I forgive you but maybe you could it so you move around easier. Please answer, Legendary ninja~7"", ""Loading takes forever. I can't even play the game now because of how long it takes for the loading screen to finish loading, and every time there's an update, which is a lot of times, the longer it takes to load, so now I can't even play the game, and It takes about more than a half an hour four the loading screen to finish, and it's awful."", 'Great game. Similar to Marvel vs Capcom but only Marvel and scaled down for mobile (Fighting game with combos, 3 tier special attacks, and unique special abilities based on the specific superheroes/supervillains). Can Free to Play the whole time or pay to play for a slight increase in progression.', 'Marvel has reached a very high rank ! Congratulate those who created this game what i like about this game is the fact that they made super heroes exactly as they are in movies and i like how the idea was placed with the crystals that gihe you super heroes once again congratulations and i hope to improve little game graphics !', ""The game is great , it's fun and it's time killing. But the 1 problem I have is that it's really hard to gain good champions. It requires an absurd amount of grinding and by the time you get a premium crystal, it's a 2 star. If the chances were a little but better the game would be really good 😁"", ""Amazing gameplay. Support is pathetic. I'm level 23 and have only just needed to contact them. Spoke to two different people. They were rude, condescending, unhelpful, didn't listen to me AND told me I was wrong. And even if I wasn't they wouldn't be able to do anything anyway so I should just shut up and leave it be. Not impressed."", 'I have been playing this game 1652 hours over 5 years and spent about $750. It comes down to crystal pulls to progress. I earned Cavalier title and have spun crystals even after spending $ that are unable to help my progress, mostly losers. Buy something nice like 2 real consoles and several games instead. Buyer beware.', ""Playing it for years now ,I noticed for a few months and now again ,when I lose connection and I log back on 50% of my health is gone ,I need feedback asap or I'm going back in time to 2016 and continue DC's injustice ..I really enjoy this game but that one issue is truly frustrating"", ""This game is so Rig and the developer is a bunch of know good people's, because they don't let you get to unlock your champions, and because of that you cannot Rank them up, which makes it hard for you to win the fights. It's time for y'all to di better with this game and stop giving people 1 star and 2 star only they're useless."", ""I think that overall, this is a pretty solid game with great graphics for a mobile game. The controls are simple but allows for sufficiently developed combos, and allows for you to have to develop a skill for fighting. I've been playing for three years and I have enjoyed this game the entire time I've played."", ""EDIT: Since the game is running smoothly, as promised, I'm changing my review and giving this game 5 stars because it's very entertaining although there are things to improve. ------------ Since the last update I have to restart the game 2-3 times before having my first battle because the game crashes. Sometimes it recovers the battle I was about to have, but most times it doesn't even do that. I like the game but this issue is getting very annoying. Please fix it and I'll increase the rating."", 'This game was fun, still kind of is. They keep ""fixing"" problems but make even more when doing so. I understand that money must be made to keep the game going but now it is all about greed. They allow people to make multiple accounts and use ""bots"" to collect as many units as possible, so they can sell gifts (during event) at half the price equal units would go for. Then join alliances so said alliance can boost their event score. If you want to try the game, do NOT spend your real money!', 'The gameplay and moves are the best I\'ve ever seen for pvp multiplayer and single player Graphics could use some updates and maybe a free crystal. I really like the character called ""White Tiger"" from The ultimate spider-man series... Also there should be better rewards for perfect wins... Where ur character hasn\'t been even touched by another character or when health of ur character is 99%.', ""This game has gotten worse over time, I mean like (GAME OF WAR) bad. Lol At this point I play out of boredom and maybe to see a new character. Telling the app maker your issues doesn't solve anything. So my advice if you decide to play, is to never spend a dime on the game and don't get into it too much. 12-22-19 update, this game still is a POS. The only upside is playing with friends and seeing new characters. You really have no control over the game, when they want you to lose, you lose."", ""I love this game. I play it all the time. And to reply to RayanQuickRats, you can fight other people in alliance wars. I do have one problem though. And that's the Arena Crystal's. Every single time I buy one, it gives me gold. And I've most likely bought 100 in my entire time of playing the game. If you can increase the rate of landing on punisher, I'm pretty I'm not the only one with this problem, but that would be great. Outside of that this game is great."", ""I've been playing this game since I was in 2nd grade, it is a great game because you could collect characters and use them in quests , battles, and you can go through the events and versus modes with them. You could power up and gain more champions with iso-8 and crystals which is a fun addition to the game making you available to be better than others stat-wise. I never lost fun and interest in this game and it is incredible. So for me in my opinion, I would download this game immediately :>:>"", 'I enjoyed the game and the graphics, It wasnt as good as injustice two but had way more characters. I think that it is very hard to get 4 star heroes and above because they just want your money. But I like the game style and their is almost a different ability for each hero. So I think that you should get it, but dont play it alot it you dont want to spend money', 'With great power, comes great expense... This game used to be amazing, but now it is a bit of a mess. It does tend to have updates with bugs and issues, which can be a pain, and the developer doesn\'t seem to accept proper responsibility for their issues, especially ones that persist and remain unfixed. Far worse than that, though, is that they seem to continually prioritize monetary gain over reasonable gameplay. I like the champs they have, but often the champ abilities are just outright ridiculous to fight. Don\'t expect this to be a relaxed game. You need a lot of skill and, even if you have it, you\'ll still often lose or fail, because that\'s the way the game is designed. I also don\'t really think they listen to or try to understand the player community, unless people stop spending and it hits their bottom line. To ""win"", expect to SPEND A LOT, an awful lot, and expect discouraging and frustrating fights that are far more trouble than fun. Even if you spend a lot, you really won\'t get a fair return for your money. The game is VERY expensive. People have spent lots and gotten very little in return. It\'s ""free to play"", but very much ""pay to get anywhere"". The alternative, to gain in-game currency, is to spend like 20 hours a week in the arena in the game, but...who wants a second job that pays them nothing?']"

Twice this game has crashed when on the events, anytime you get close to earning one of the big guns, it crashes and I have to reinstall and start again! As a stand alone one player it it a very good game, but it's almost as if the game is forcing you to spend money on it rather than earning it through game play. Seriously annoying."", ""I enjoy playing this game, but it is seriously flawed. Events frequently disappear, leaving you unable to complete quests. The game constantly freezes during gameplay, and that further hampers your ability to complete quests. Also, when the game freezes during a mission, any boosts are still used despite not receiving credit or rewards for the mission. None of this would bother me if I didn't have to pay for some of the features."", ""I would rate this a five star if it wasn't so expensive to obtain upgrades and the screen going black and you lose what you were going for. There aren't too many ads. It's just that the higher you get the more the ads black out the screen and you have to reset the game. You need more along the lines of the graphics.

I rate this 1star"", 'Retired and in a club that likes to try new games like this. Read the 5 & 4 star ratings and the 2 star rating and you will see practically the same comments. The point is this game, while fairly exciting, has the same problems scattered across users. Play ""freezing"", resetting play and losing all gains and being kicked out of the game during ads. However, the most unforgivable issue is the lack of empathy and understanding from game developers. So find a different game!', ""Don't waste any money on this one, when you upgrade your guns it makes the zombies harder to kill so you don't gain anything. All my guns are 10 star or better and I have close to 500 battles at each location and I can no longer win a battle unless I buy boosters, you can't win them fast enough to play. Update: now it says mission failed when I won pretty often, it won't let me save my progress so I deleted the game and reinstalled, it won't let load my saved progress, junky"", ""Great game. I would've gave 5 stars but I have lost a lot of cash and gold because of the game crashing. And then there is paying for a battle pass every time a new event comes up. I don't think that is right.

I only wish that they add support for bluetooth controllers for my moga pro other than that. everything is good', ""Started out okay but there's issues. I upgrade my gun to a point its killing zombies with one shot, next level with same gun it takes 4-5 shots per zombie. I know levels are labeled with a difficulty, but to me that should be a change in the quantity and frequency of the zombies and not the effectiveness of the weapon. So I upgrade more...still 4-5 shots, even head shots. In the end, I think the devs are just trying to get you to open your wallet. Gets almost impossible at level 65-75."", 'VERY ADDICTIVE!!! I have never played a mobile game so much.

Shame on the developers. : (', 'This game was alright at first except for some truly obnoxious ""in-game-purchase"" popups. Then there were incentives to watch videos after missions, which was great.

It also seems like the better I do and try to do, the Game will not let me. It's weird and odd. I also think I'm right and have a great point to what I'm saying, that must be why y'all have to keep on Updating it. Also, some Characters aren't as strong, fast, and just plain good as They should be, such as Sub-Zero, and Lui Kang. Daryl D."", ""The app needs grid internet to get started not 4g connection. It takes ages to load up the game. If you try 10 times, you will be successful once it twice, half my phone's battery is drained in loading the game. There's no way to track how much time is left to load the game, a same usual music with a hovering circle keeps playing. That interest and enthusiasm of playing is only destroyed at bootup We don't live to play this game only, when we get a call the app crashes immediately."", ""Good graphics, well-adapted game play for the phone, and not hammering you with ads. Unfortunately, over the last few months the developers have been making substantial, and ill-advised changes - fighting mechanics, new and interesting attempts to monetize the game - and judging by the amount of glitches, doing it poorly. It's becoming less and less fun - i can't imagine what starting out fresh is like now."", ""I really like to play this game. It has a lot of action with awsome fatalities. But the only thing is it's quite hard to get souls and there is very low chance of getting a diamond charecter from packs. I think there should be atleast one more way to get souls or the chance of getting a diamond charecter must be increased. Please work on it. Thank you"", ""DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME!!! The game is ridiculous. You can't block anymore. The AI immediately attacks after you've been knocked down and the only thing a player can do is wait until the AI is DONE. Lin Kuei's tower is a waste of time. Sub Zero will hit your characters 3 times each and you're done. The game is garbage. I'm out. Also, look at the % for the packs before you pay money. It's a con. You'll never get the players they're advertising on the packs."", ""I like the game, it has some flaws however I would recommend to many people.But a little problem that I have right now is that I'm trying to connect my game with my gmail account so my game can save. I played the games for.a year before but I got bore of it and uninstalled it but nownI wanted to play it again and my progress didn't save I have been trying to connect my new game with The WBplay center but it keeps saying that my account is invalid, I even made a new gmail account."", ""Game used to be great fun, even with all the money the devs try to get you to spend. Problem is one of their updates caused game breaking bugs for me and when trying to reach out to the support team I've been passed around from rep to rep since October! And now they just ignore me! I know im only one person, but they just don't care about their playerbase unless your talking $$$! Time to uninstall!"", ""*sigh* great game but the card packs are a bit overpriced. Its completely free to play, it's not too frustrating, I do well in it. These guys do listen to its players (as of today they are fixing some bugs that have been addressed). Please balance some of the characters, don't pair up a gold team with a completely diamond one. How does your matchmaking work anyways? It's not actually player VS player, so what's the harm in lowering prices and handing out good characters every once in a while?"", ""Good game but I liked it when u could choose your own characters to purchase. I don't like wanting 24hr until they only give u 3 to choose from. it never be the character u want. Also they're should be some time when xp is double or something to help u build characters up. once they hit 30 it's extremely difficult to build."", ""I really enjoy playing this game its my favorite game on mobile but it's really frustrating to get a diamond card I mean I open like 10 packs at times but still don't get a diamond I really hope on the next update you guys can make some changes atleast give us 100% to get a diamond card maybe for 800 souls or so that would make the game more enjoyable for the die hard fans"", ""This is one of my favourite games. I love this game. But i can't give it 5 stars because of linn kuel tower. At battle 40 you face sub-zero grandmaster. One problem is, if he uses hos ice decoy and you fail to kill him in the same round, he'll keep on using ice decoy, which is super unbalanced. I have been stuck there for a week because there isn't that many ways of leveling up. So i'm just stuck there."", ""Game is fun, but requires you to always be online. Which wouldn't be too bad if it would let you log in. Couldn't log in in 2 days now. Other online games like Pokemon go work with my wifi. This game has some really bad connection issues. Works on mobile data, but consumes too much data for my taste. So I cannot play it. Fix log in problems and connection issues and the game will be good."", 'I enjoy playing this game, the challenges and the characters. But I have given this app a 1 star rating, because I does not log me in, everytime I try to open it. I have constant 4G network coverage with plenty of data, yet it keeps telling me, that data connection is required, yet I have full network coverage. This needs to be fixed...']"

Don’t forget to let us know what you think about the update.
Your MFG team","['Dead game. Never reward players. Edit: Solely, the game isn\'t frequently updated so what\'s the point of being an ""online game"" anyway? The only thing to connect to the Internet is to purchase some relic packs which are hardly ever on sale. The game IS web-connectivity required, yet acts better as an offline game. Instead of keeping ""online"" requirement with limited features, try open back the other 2 Arena stages, expand some mission scenarios in red cities; they are all in-game resources. Leaving the game on its own, sure, I\'m fine with that, then, at least exploit those maps again and you can leave the game unattended as it\'s always been. There\'re also the blueprints\' issue, prominiently 1-2 drop PER RED CITY. The in-game money is terribly valued; an exchange rate from gold to cash that should-not-exist; and, cheapskate award, reward from watching ads. The game scales with time and players\' records; hence implementing scaling formulas for in-game stuff is a must.', ""The graphics are so amazing the game runs great the story is awesome. The gameplay itself is great. It's incredible on how a phone you can get an amazing game with good graphics and smooth gameplay. Everything about this game is amazing and to the developer and everyone who made this game good job and keep making games like this the mobile community needs companys like you guys.👍"", ""Ngl i started this game with the thought in mind to hate it, but no matter how hard i try i can't. It's hilarious in itself and even though the protagonist has the vocabulary of a parrot and NOTHING is explained, it's satisfying. The wrench that you start out with is literally better than any other weapon in the game. The sniper has bullets that allow you to change their path. It's great. Only minor problem is the controls seem a lil bit clunky."", ""This game is kinda cool. But getting the rewards after you've completed the task or you've purchased something in order to receive gold??? Man it's like squeezing blood from a turnip. If you're looking for a fair game app. That pays you for your trouble or money.... Forget it.."", ""The only bad thing I can think of is eventually in the game you have to wait 2+ hrs of waiting to have your upgrades for your weapons and you also have to wait about 19 min later for each mission. So you can't binge the game. Overall I love this game a lot, this truly is the best zombie shooter. It beats the new and original COD zombies. (COD mobile and Nazi zombies)"", ""I Love This Game. If You Like Adventures Or Zombies I Definetly Recommend You Play This Game It's Very Addictive. Even If You're Scared Of Zombies I Still Recommend You Play This Your Fear Of Zombies Will Dissapear I Promise, And Make Sure You Have A Lot Of Free Time. DEAD TRIGGER & DEAD TRIGGER 2 Is Surely One Of The Best Zombie Games Ever! 5 Stars! :D"", ""It's great but,you should've made this offline!And,you should've also put the guns in dead trigger part 1 here,like the Colt 1911,the remington shotgun,etc.And,the decorations for the hideout is so expensive,and you should also make more looks of zombies,like their clothing,faces,etc.And,you should've also put the arenas in dead trigger part 1 in here,like the haunted graveyard"", 'Really good game. The fact that this is a mobile game means that the developers put a lot of effort and time into this masterpiece of a game. 5 out of 5 stars, but one thing I would add is a setting that lets you shoot when you want to, instead of automatically firing at barrels and zombies.', 'The best zombie shooter game in android hands down! Very good graphics, you can customize the controls, varieties of zombies, different types of challenges, a lot of weapons and locations. But no game is perfect, there are always some negative sides like zombies get stronger easily, blueprints of items and weapons does not drop frequently. Warning, hard is literally hard lol. You must master Dead trigger 1 before proceeding to this game. This game is really challenging. Extend the campaign too.', 'I was stuck on an earlier level were i couldnt mount a machine gun. But let me tell you this.. I CANNOT WAIT FOR DEAD TRIGGER 3! i love this game!!!! It is amazing. Its like resident evil mix with john wick. It needs more missions and dont get me wrong i like the ones i do. And ""auto fire"" amazing. I would LOVE to do more team missions. Maybe take some of them with you? Anyway. Love this game. If this was for ps4 or xb1 i would get it.', 'Playing since Nov. 2019. Graphics and sound 100%. Way to long to build or upgrade.

Allow us to place the attack button on the left side of the screen like we were able to in DT 1. Why do you refuse to do that? Please implement this :( Replying to your reply (Dec 27): I know that. I\'m asking why you do not want to allow it. Would it ruin your game? Back in 2013 I sent you an email and got this reply from Matej Vobornik: ""This issue is going to be fixed in the next update""', ""Love it. Best zombie game I've played yet. Not many ads at all compared to every other games I've played. I give it 15 out of 10 Stars!!!!! Awesome job to the makers of this game. 👍👍👍👍"", 'despite the graphics this game is enjoyable but this game has an automatic shooting I still enjoy either way at least there is a setting to change to manual shooting atleast and I hope they update this game please developers its now 2020 and you are not responding or updates or making new game whats wrong developers?', 'Really great fun game. I was just disapointed that I beat the story mode unknowingly. I had just started getting better guns. This game should have been more challenging with bosses near the end of each level. It was rather unerwhelming. Hopefully they update it with more mini games or make a Dead Trigger 3 with way more bosses and harder challenges.', ""Only early days, but game looks good - great even, One thing: I can't create my personal gamer tag!!! it's driving me mental.

Hopefully new chapters will be available soon. 🤘"", ""It is so far the best game I ever played. It has graphics like that of ps4 and the story line is also good. the only problem is the price of weapons and upgrades the decorations is also far too costly to do . I have to earn for days to upgrade something and wait again for days for it's upgrade to finish"", 'the gameplay is good and the graphics is awesome but the wait time ruins it. i cant play this game for more than 5 minutes because a mission takes 5 minutes and than i have to wait 20 minutes for the next level!!! dead trigger 2 if you could just remove the mission wait time the game would be 10x more awesome. i know you did it bcz the game would be short but if you do this than nobody will play this. or at least makr every skip cost like 1 coin.', 'This game is very fun and addictive, i havent bought anything with real money yet but i am considering it, im level 27 and climbing my way around the world upgrading my tech to unlock more places. I would love the feature to play online multiplayer. That feature would make me give this game 5 stars. Thank you everyone who makes this game for making it as good as it is', ""In contrast to Unskilled, this game remains a great zombie shooter as long as i remember it. Plays perfectly both on mobile and tablets. Beautifully designed controls with level design and guns (good variety without the ridiculous kids' stuff). Great 60fps performance. Dynamic, smoking and full-gore zombie-smashing gameplay. And even though it has no PvP content - its not a problem at all. Better not fix it, than turn it into another abondoned broken game."", 'Great game TBH, the graphics, controls and UI is just awesome, kudos to the development team 😁👌 Also, could you please integrate multiplayer with voice chat into the game, that would be a huge improvement. Thank you.', ""This is one of the best zombie shooting game I've been played, but what I find annoying in this game is the dialogues of the character are big and near the crosshair. When the zombie entered the crtical area, the big letter just appear and flashing and blocked the crosshair. This is just ruined the experience of the game. Please move these letter somewhere else please. Thank you."", ""Greatest game ever!!! Thanks so much for fixing the problem i had with it!! I appreciate it so so much!! Your team responded in a timely manner n got it done asap and thats a great team for you!!

Really enjoyable!!', 'The game is awesome but when i had to shoot i didnt know how at first then i got the hang of it then i had to duck under and go under the gate i didnt know how so all i am saying is before the whole game starts PLEASE put INSTRUCTIONS next time but the game is really really really fun', ""I never care about graphics however they are worth noting in this game, the gameplay is quite engaging and feels like I'm playing a console zombies game (I'm not naming any of them here but you all know which one I'm talking about) I'm on Chromebook too and it's multiple gamepad support is great, I can use wasd and configure the controls to my liking"", ""A follow up to the first one. Played this one on iOS back in the day just like the first one, amongst a sea of average free-to-play mobile games who flood you with ads every few minutes with mediocre gameplay, this is one of many well made games that doesn't push ads all up in your face. Amazing just like the original."", 'I was initially happy with the game but gradually as u go few levels up and reach Tech level 5/6 the game gets really boring and as the game proceeds new challenges stop coming, this is really disappointing. I guess there is some glitch with the later part of the game.', ""This Game Stands Out more than any other games that are Zombie-killing FPS games, & Its just downright fun!

Review Update: I had to up my rating to 5 stars! As far as Zombie-killer FPS's go, DT2 is just by far the Best: There's Different Challenges & Tournaments for Gold. And The Weapons Upgrading and Lair Upgrades as well! Awesome!"", ""Pretty decent zombie shooter, all things considered. Pay 2 play aspects are minimal and restricted to getting guns faster or getting 'gold' guns which are basically re-skins but shiny. There are ad's but they're removed if you buy something. All in all, I definitely recommend giving this game a try."", 'Love the game. U make money quick enough to do upgrades but the time it takes for those upgrades is crazy unless u buy gold. and when its done u get nothing out of it other then weapons.

Looks like a really long campaign too! Can't wait to get further and expierence the entire game"", ""I really enjoy this game. And coming from a person that doesnt enjoy mobile games, it means a lot. Animation is good, detail is good, gameplay is fluid. Definitely worth giving it a go if you enjoy zombie games.

Boooooriiiing."", ""Game play is great compared to most games out there. Unfortunately the game only has 6 complete World maps areas for you to unlock and play.

The minigames are really good. The controls are werid at first but you'll get used to it. Decorating your base is fun. Every weapon is cool and unique. This game is a master piece. The only problem is the battle pass. I don't know if I'm the only one that doesn't know how it works. Oh can't forget about the Freakin' cool maps with good music."", ""it's good but the thing is it gets boring quick maybe you should add new game modes or make getting money a little bit easier because how hard it is in 3 mins you get like 3 coins like how is that so if you are reading this add a big update for that!! If you do you will get like 4 more 5 stars from from my other account wait I mean 5 more because including me so plz do this i bet everyone would like it."", ""I love this game, it's hard to get used to if your usually an Xbox or ps type of person like me, but it is easier than most games. The settings are adjustable just like one Xbox or ps so you can play comfortably. It's easy to work with and it's super fun, unfortunately there is a max level of 55 that you can reach, but fortunately it takes a while to get there so you can still have plenty of fun, even if you have reached the max level, you can still play the same games, but you won't earn any xp"", 'I think that this is a great game to play with friends, and it has a wide variety of maps, avatars, and weapons (at a reasonable price). However, whenever I enter the Battle Royale, the game just freezes. This has happened multiple times, and also the game is rather slow to load. I would really appreciate if you could try and fix this. Overall, I think that this is a great game, so thank you! 😉😉', 'I cant say how terrible this game has gotten. First of all, the one hit weapons. What the hell were you thinking? Oh yeah, you just want money, you dont care about the players who get 1 shot every time they spawn. And in deathmatch, players spawn right behind you and then kill you 1 second later. Theres no point in trying to grind because you will get put back down by players who spend money to buy weapons. Its pay-to-win and I dont recommend playing this game because you will waste your time.', ""Almost perfect game, a few issues: Players whom have a grapple gun make flag capture completely unplayable, perhaps lock out grapple weapons in games where they give too much of an advantage? And the bubblegum.. even if you're above it or around it, it still slows you down, this makes trying to avoid it pointless, as the hitboxes for it seem to be very cloudy. Other than that it'd be a 5/5, please fix if you can?"", 'Best game ever playes dosent waste ur battery. Good controlls. Very eaay to controll and if its bad u can just chane it and basacley its the best game i ever played and it so easy apart the ones when it starts to get harder but i can still do itand if this game was deleted i would have nothing else to do!! Anyways however reads this download the game staright away ;) and it dosent waste ur time and me and my cousin play it every day and we kill the people ;) and if u font fownload it ur stupid!!', ""So, about pixel gun 3d... In the past, you could buy every weapon with gems or coins, but now you can only win some of them (like 60 of them) anda whole bunch of event weapons. I played back when level 45 was max and you actually got matched with people with similar weapons or skill. Now people with level 400 efficiency weapons come in and one shot you. Which is total bs. And every one of them plays woth auto aim and the ones with max weapons who don't use auto aim are easy to kill. Fix it pg3d."", 'Its was a good game at first, its pay to win which would be fair enough if the tapjoy free gems worked but after completing it told me wait 2 days, its now been over a week and still nothing. Also if you watch a video at the end of a game for x2 rewards itll have already put you in another game by the time you finish it and then takes stuff off you for leaving. This makes it impossible to keep up with the people that put money into it and you end up being dominated every game by laser guns ect', ""I love this game, really. I used to play it all the time when I was younger and it's awesome to see that one of my favorite childhood mobile games has improved and is still going. People have said this game is pay to win or is a scam, don't listen to these people. The game never forces you to buy anything and it always give you what you payed for. You are NEVER required to pay any money in this game."", ""Terrible, I used to play the game alot, then the game got a rework to be pay to win. Unless you're too tier player, you will have to pay at some point. It's not like cod mobile where you just can buy skins that give your MINOR traits, but in pixel gun the average rifle will have you paying $3 for something that when you level up you will most likely need to replace, which is more expensive. This game is fun when playing with friends or on campaign, but they need to make the game fair for newbs."", 'I used to play a long time ago and it was great, it was fun and felt rewarding. Now i cant get my old save progress, and the way the game is now its just not as fun, i miss the old game with friendly chat rooms, there was nothing that seemed impossible to get or isnt overpowered. The game is ruined. They changed the format of the game and made everyone restart essentially and it is a brutal experience to new players almost forcing to pay to cut ridiculous grind times and get an advantage.', ""Pretty lit game, after the modules and all that advanced stuff lost traction. I still prefer the 2017-18 days tho, at least I want the old guns back. I only gave it 4 stars for the nostalgic memories however ive seen the game start to become annoyingly paytowin and I'm only getting along because of my grinding before p2w began. Really hoping they remove the stupidly high prices and upgrades because I really doubt new players would like the game and I'm also sure this is why all old friends gone"", ""I have decided to give pg3d 3 stars instead of 5 because of a specific issue that I've been having since the 2019 Halloween update. When I log on to pixel gun everything is going well... Except for when I go to collect my daily rewards, my game starts to lag, then the screen starts to look like it's being possessed by a demon. It literally starts showing random letters and numbers, and sometimes the weapons will glitch out and they show up on different areas of the screen. Please fix this PG3D!"", ""I love pixel gun 3d, don't get me wrong, but recently it's been getting SO pay to win, ever since level 55. Plus why would u add 10 levels and ONLY add 1 gun. Don't even get me started on the upgrade system. It is so broken and makes the game impossible to play without paying money. I'm level 37 and have aquired 6000 gems. I have spent 4800 of them upgrading guns and the other 1200 in the traders van. I have spent almost 100$ on this game and just BARELY gotten by. I hope u fix this pg3d."", 'This game is really addicting and it\'s also really good and btw, I would give this a lot of stars if you guys can like, Add a option to trade, And the game is not balanced, Like seriously It\'s just not balanced! It\'s not about the level, It\'s the loadout and gameplay, The feature for this, Is ""Progress Scanner"" It record one of the matches if you think you got better or the enemies are too easy, Then there\'s the progress, The progress counts how much your good at the game, Hope u like the idea.', ""This game is amazing and so much fun but I rate it 4 stars only because the prices on the guns are way to expensive I mean you can grind and all of that but still I think gems are a bit easier to get now. 1000 coins and more but you get like 5 coins in a match so that's gonna take a lot of matches all I'm trying to say is that you need to lower the price of these guns especially if the other players are free 2 play"", ""Dear PG3D developers... PLEASE add a refund system for the gallery. Since you can't even remotely test a weapon before buying it, it's really hard to tell if it's usable compared to... other weapons. Assuming this is read and taken into consideration, pretty sure no one would mind if there was a cool down for it and a limited time before a weapon can't be refunded, but I really like to use weapons I don't see and I'm constantly disappointed with what I get.Thanks for reading."", ""This game is really cool. I only have a few things I'd like to change. One of these things would be to fix the messages in the clan. Every time I'm in the lobby it says I got a new message in the clan and when I check there is no new message. This isn't a serious thing but I'd like it fixed. Another thing would be to make the guns and armour cheaper. I think they are a little expensive."", ""I think this is a great game because this game has a lot to do in it like racing and battle royalty.Also u can customize your character in it with the custom skin and there's a lot of events that happen like 2xp and 50% off on some guns but I think that they should make some more guns in this game but anyways I thinks is a 5 star game for that."", ""This game has on more than one occasion completely erased all of my progress and data, forcing me to start out fresh from bottom level without my consent. This means that all the time and money I've spent on the game is completely gone with no hopes of getting it back. The developers never address not attempt to communicate with their player base, even more so when the players are facing an issue and need help. Do nOT play this game, do not spend money on it, this game is a straight out sCAM!!"", 'This game is amazing! Theres just one problem, when we make characters sometimes the feature that makes both arms the same can be a pain like when you wanna make them look different. I could be absolutely wrong so please tell me. Have a nice day! ;3', 'The matchmaking in this game is really bad. Im a level 34 and i go against level 50 who can easily one shot me. With that happening, it is really hard to level up, get coins, exp, troph. I mean i have to rely on mini games and co-op which is not what i want to play all the time. Please fix your matching making system it is really frustrating. Update: now i am level 36 and it just get worse, now there is pretty much a zero chance for me too win any match except co-op and fort', ""The game is so epic and I love it and it's fun and I'm addicted to it not really but yea and it is so awesome and you should really get it because it's really fun and It is really cool and I love it and I think I already said that but it is the second best game ever and I think everyone should get it because it is like really cool And now I am running out of letters so bye."", 'Its have a cool graphics,so many guns,and nice player but the guns are too expensive.its need to be 1 victory=5 coins not 3.pls read this pixel gun 3D DEVELOPER.And also the GB needed is so high my memory is full now.And the skins is so expensive too and the upgrade.PG3D now is pay to win but i still play it pls fix this.But thz cause the updating is kinda fast i wish it could be more fast than now.But the installing is so slow and if its done it gonna repeat again and again every updade fix ths', ""A true classic. Controls are a bit difficult to master, but once you do, it's THAT much easier. I suggest a transparent pen for skin editing (to make bits of a custom skin see-through) to make nicer skins, or maybe a 3D rendering tool. Other than that, it's perfect."", ""Is still fun, though after a brief hiatus all purchases and progress have been reverted as if starting new. Many, many hours, and quite a sum of money spent over the years, now all completely gone. No response from developer when emailed. I don't mean to be that guy, but that's completely unacceptable."", ""This game used to be nice and balanced and now it's here to take your money and thats what it did to me.I have spent over thousands of money on this game and it was completly pointless.Today I went in to the game and realised I had over 300 gems and then I went to go check out the traders van and saw the pet dragon which I had already bought and went to check how much it costed for the skin and then it took my gems away and bought a dumb skin that can't even improve my gameplay.I want a refund!!"", 'Its good but glitchy. Like, really glitchy. I cant even play the game most of the time because it just kicks me off and sends me back to my homescreen or the screen just turns black and freezes my whole phone. I dont think it is play to win, but maybe thats just me. All and all good game but the glitching is AWFUL. Also, if it is just my phone model, I own a Motorola e5 play by Lenovo.', ""I'll give it a three stars because it's good but at the same time bad because of when you go to team deathmatch I get put in a game where it's all ready about to end, and on team rumble it's worst because you get put into a team kind of average but on the other team it's over power because their trophy is 5000 or more and they have weapon the kill you in 2 hits (that's alot of because) (but, you get it right)"", ""This game was a four star before but the new update screwed it up . First , they made the ' predator ' gun fire way slower and make that amazing 650$ shotgun lose thee fast firing ability that allows me to hit more enemy easier . Second , the new map is totally unbalanced because the team that spawns on the island ( not spawning on the ship ) would just constantly jump on the trampoline and camp on the bus . I hope this game's developers can do something about these problems."", 'this is a cool game just why in death matches and duals you always play with people that are higher levels than you and they always have better weapons. So you can fix that and make us play with people in the same tornument or with people with the same level. Please fix this it makes death matches and duals not fun. This was my feedback', ""Coming from experiencing the original, this is a total waste of time. Short of investing over $100 you'll be curb stomped your way to gold then have about an hour of fun before you're curb stomped again. Unless you're planning to invest money or 30+ hours a week this isn't worth the space you give it."", ""Fix your goddamn game!! When you rent the weapons for 3 matches but you don't use that gun in those three matches it still counts that you used it. so i lost a good gun not even using it in three matches. i was gonna play with that gun later but no it had to be like that! But overall this game is awesome!!"", 'I hate to say that these game really sucks why? You see when I\'m playing some optional games these really happen recently in the middle of the game I\'m the MVP then these bunch of stupid things just came through ""Reconnecting In The Room"" I waited for a minute then suddenly my statistics got erased/deleted that\'s why I really hate these game and btw battle Royal game mode sucks', 'It\'s so f****** hard! and so f****** laggy! fix the goddamn game now! and why did you get rid of ""sword of Shadows"" Out of Armory!!!

And all guns please pretty please."", ""One of the best games I've played I'm my life but they need to lower the limit of stars you have to get in campaign and they need to give you a free gun when you get level 65as a prize for working hard developers if you read this good job just try to think about the stuff I said that need to be in the game like a free gun when you get level 65"", 'Good game, but they kinda destroyed it as far as clans go. There are unfair one shots and all that. I still love the game though. Also, we dont need more 1 shot area damages! Its so annoying to the actuall good players when people spam all the good wepons like aly wolf and offensive fireworks! And bring back ultimatum!', 'Love it, but only problem is the raids mode because you randomly take damage, and the lucky chest, why do you only get 1 part? Personally, I think it should be like before when you just get the weapon instead of parts of the weapon. Other than that, great game Cubic!']"

Also, it\'s impossible to ""replay"" a mission immediately after having failed. Furthermore, why are we supposed to pay after failure of a mission? Can\'t we just hit the ""return"" button?', 'Too much car crashes. Not even in real life we have drivers like this. It would be awesome if there were less crashes.

Even though it's a bit violent and I advice people under age 10,12,13 not to play it,for the people who are allowed it's amazing and I definitely recommend people who are that age to try it.You dont have to like it just see how it goes.Although,I will never be interested in guns.Sorry,but not for me.Have fun trying it! Make sure to advise your parents about Gangsta Vegas. ☝️"", ""This game is wonderful, but the timer missions sucks!! I can't enjoy the whole game with the timer.

It runs great on my s10e, it looks good, it plays good, and sounds good. I'm not far in the story but it seems to do a good job at explaining things.

But the game has just two flaws, 1: the alliance wars and quests, why is it that if all of our characters are K.Oed we have to just sit there and wait for the war to end it's a bit frustrating. 2: you know the arena crystal? The one with the chance of getting the punisher? Yeah that one sucks, because all you receive is gold, EVERY TIME, 😤 it's infuriating and it really gets a person's hopes down. Pls fix."", ""Great game to play very, very time consuming. But one thing is if you want to get far in the game you have to waste so much time playing and kinda farming and playing more to get far and sometimes you have to spend money on this game from time to time to get some where slightly worth it kind of. But if you don't care about all that, then if you really want to succeed then you have spend most of your day playing it doing stuff to progress and you have to spend alot of money I'm mean alots $100's"", 'Happy player here! I have been playing MCOC since October 2019 (not sure, somewhat..) and I am addicted to it. The designs are fantastic and satisfying. I also love the monthly events with new champs getting release every month. I love the difficulty of the game, the rarity of aquiring new champs. I love all these challenges and that you can play for free without spending any real money. I love you KABAM!', ""Great game i have to say, but then with the hero crystal, i keep getting 2 star heroes and 1 star heroes, what's up with that!!? Super cool game though, and also, for people like us that dont have data, please make it more cost effective, and also, if you can, please add an offline mode where you can practice. Please reply to this"", ""Honestly I play quiet a few games. All different types. From slots to castle clash to marvel. This particular game is in one of my top favorites. I like it cause it's not a full pay to win. It gives plenty of upgrades to keep moving where you dont get stuck but the levels are pretty tough. It's a very interactive fighting games so if you win or lose it's pretty much on your ability to play. Overall great game"", 'I like the game,but it too hard to get any good characters without paying a lot of money.after almost a year and half and $2000.00 later all I got was just two ,six star character.i am about to call it quit because it just too much money just to keep playing ,oh and updates just keep coming every couple weeks,until your phone run out of storage space. You should get a six star character for keep updating, spending over $100.00,should be just as easy to get six star as it is to get a one,two star', ""This game raises my blood pressure. I deeply resent the luck-of-the draw mechanic for obtaining new fighters - I'm drawing at the 5-star level now, and of the nine I've collected, all but one is among the very worst champions in the game, as rated by the highly active online community. There's no option to trade or improve the game's bad champions in any meaningful way, meaning that if you draw poorly, the game's mechanics will require you to spend severely limited resources on ranking them up to improve, meaning you won't have these resources to spend on better champions further down the road. While the RNG is the worst factor, it's still a fairly mediocre game in other regards. The fighting is bland and repetitive. The art feels like it should be better, for a game based on comics. The one stellar element of the game is the animation rendering - if there's a prettier fighting game app, I haven't seen it. If you're into guilds, you may enjoy the game's Alliance feature."", ""Very fun game but do not give them your credit card info. I was charged $50 for some reason and they will not even communicate with me about what I was charged for! I've done some research and it seems they often keep credit card numbers on file and charge fraudulent charges. Then if you dispute it they lock important game features. When I contacted support for help they immediately close the case. No communication, no explanation. Completely unprofessional."", ""I haven't been playing this game for long, but from what I've seen it is very well made. I love Marvel, and the game itself doesn't take up much space. When I first started the game, the storyline was quite confusing, and not truly straight forward, and storylines are always a big part of the game to me personally. As I played more the storyline became clearer, but not all the details are straight forward to me yet. This is a highly recommended game if you want some action and good controls."", ""Support is horrible. Returning player from almost 5 years ago and they erased my name and won't let me create a new one, so that means no friends list or allegiance. When contacting KABAM their automated response system tells me it can't verify that I'm me!?? What's the point of playing if I can't even add my friends on here??"", ""Don't bother with it their customer support it garbage. My account was hacked (as was the email associated with it) so I needed to get the email changed. They expect me to know the exact date from 5+ years ago I created the account and despite me giving them a ton of personal details only I would know, like my bank into, they are not budging. All they do is send generic responses back and don't actually help. Won't bother with any of their games again"", 'Just started the game approximately 4 hours ago, unlocked high level heroes out the gate, decided to spend a few bucks and get the 3 star deadpool pack, got offered to create a KABAM account for a free crystal, used Play Games to login and the entire game started over from the very beginning with no way to restore my purchases. Words cannot describe how infuriated this is for a second rate piece of garbage mobile game.', ""I'd give this game 10/5 stars if that was a thing lol Absolutely LOVE THIS GAME!!! Just a few suggestions hehe.. I think maybe focus on the most iconic characters and make them as good as possible_ eg. Captain America or Spiderman Classic, Cap is one of the most iconic characters yet his moves feel very simplistic there are a lot iconic battles cap has had with moves you can incorporate into his SPs etc. There are others as well. But thanks for your Hard work. KEEP IT UP YOU GUYS ARE AWESOME!!!"", ""1.You only get Champions randomly despite of the fact you like them or not. 2. Story mode can't be played without consumption of health. 3. Crystals for champions are rarely lately given. 4. Those crystals or materials are not sufficiently given to upgrade champions. 5. some champions have same ultras 6. when in versus mode there's a quite difference of champions power like your champion is 170 and your opponent is 470."", 'Amazing game! Cant stop playing it because of its awesomeness. Highly recommend it if you love Marvel or you want to get into the Marvel universe. The graphics are 100%. One thing that would make it a little better would be to add a mode where you can play offline so all of the lovers of this game can play it even more', ""This game is the most wonderful ❤️ game I have ever download in years. But I don't know why if you are a beginner it automatically gives you some alliances which I don't like. But after all it is really great. If you download this game you will never regret it, the graphics are perfect, the marvel players, chatting with others around the globe, this is awesome. But don't forget it uses data but not much. I wish you guys can bring an offline place so you can fight with the computer."", ""Fun at first, but it gets to a point where you literally cant beat a character in your quests because the opponent has 'death immunity' and 'indestructible' so no matter how hard you try you cant win. Happens randomly with different events so it isnt even a regulated thing you have to overcome. It's just there to mess you up. Also the difficulty gets 1000x more difficult after the 3rd chapter so you can only advance if you spend money or spend 8 hours a day farming catalysts."", ""Marvelous game. A must have for marvel fans. Plenty of rewards. The devs regularly update the game and release new stuff. There's tons of content and things to do and thousands upon thousands of people play this game. Although you can spend money on there, you can still be f2p if you grind. I've played loads of mobile games from clash royale to mk mobile but all have been taken off just so I can focus my spare time and a little bit of extra cash on this game"", ""The game itself and a lot in it I very much enjoy. I used to play a while back and I enjoyed it, and that hasn't changed. When you play this, however, you'll have to know what to grind; don't complain about not getting good champions after some time playing. After all, Global will usually give you a decent tip (Alliances, folks). You don't have to pay to get far, it just takes a little longer. A bug here and there, but nothing too raunchy."", ""I've been playing this since 2015. I may have been this game's biggest fan but I had to rate it at two stars because I've been trying to download the latest update for two days and haven't had any luck. And I know it's not my wifi or my cellphone network because it lets me do literally everything else but download the latest update. Please fix this."", 'The game is great but its just another mobile money pit and they will take advantage of you wanting to progess in the game. Lol Credits and things are over priced Kabam in no way cares about the people playing this game far as loot drops . Characters will be unbeatable and try to force you to use credits to progress. Rewards need to be better and it would be perfect', ""Do you like spinning slot machines that simply change to the losing/lowest winning combination? Everytime you play. Enjoy this game. You can spend hours and hours on this game but you won't get far simply because the reward system is just persuading you to purchase the boxes."", ""This is the best game in all the places that exist I pray that you make more abilities and skill for the characters in this game and make it so you can run around in the contest and hack into Iron Man's suit.

Please answer, Legendary ninja~7"", ""Loading takes forever. I can't even play the game now because of how long it takes for the loading screen to finish loading, and every time there's an update, which is a lot of times, the longer it takes to load, so now I can't even play the game, and It takes about more than a half an hour four the loading screen to finish, and it's awful."", 'Great game.

Congratulate those who created this game what i like about this game is the fact that they made super heroes exactly as they are in movies and i like how the idea was placed with the crystals that gihe you super heroes once again congratulations and i hope to improve little game graphics !', ""The game is great , it's fun and it's time killing. But the 1 problem I have is that it's really hard to gain good champions. It requires an absurd amount of grinding and by the time you get a premium crystal, it's a 2 star. If the chances were a little but better the game would be really good 😁"", ""Amazing gameplay. Support is pathetic. I'm level 23 and have only just needed to contact them. Spoke to two different people. They were rude, condescending, unhelpful, didn't listen to me AND told me I was wrong. And even if I wasn't they wouldn't be able to do anything anyway so I should just shut up and leave it be. Not impressed."", 'I have been playing this game 1652 hours over 5 years and spent about $750. It comes down to crystal pulls to progress. I earned Cavalier title and have spun crystals even after spending $ that are unable to help my progress, mostly losers. Buy something nice like 2 real consoles and several games instead. Buyer beware.', ""Playing it for years now ,I noticed for a few months and now again ,when I lose connection and I log back on 50% of my health is gone ,I need feedback asap or I'm going back in time to 2016 and continue DC's injustice ..I really enjoy this game but that one issue is truly frustrating"", ""This game is so Rig and the developer is a bunch of know good people's, because they don't let you get to unlock your champions, and because of that you cannot Rank them up, which makes it hard for you to win the fights. It's time for y'all to di better with this game and stop giving people 1 star and 2 star only they're useless."", ""I think that overall, this is a pretty solid game with great graphics for a mobile game. The controls are simple but allows for sufficiently developed combos, and allows for you to have to develop a skill for fighting. I've been playing for three years and I have enjoyed this game the entire time I've played."", ""EDIT: Since the game is running smoothly, as promised, I'm changing my review and giving this game 5 stars because it's very entertaining although there are things to improve. ------------ Since the last update I have to restart the game 2-3 times before having my first battle because the game crashes. Sometimes it recovers the battle I was about to have, but most times it doesn't even do that. I like the game but this issue is getting very annoying. Please fix it and I'll increase the rating."", 'This game was fun, still kind of is. They keep ""fixing"" problems but make even more when doing so. I understand that money must be made to keep the game going but now it is all about greed. They allow people to make multiple accounts and use ""bots"" to collect as many units as possible, so they can sell gifts (during event) at half the price equal units would go for. Then join alliances so said alliance can boost their event score. If you want to try the game, do NOT spend your real money!', 'The gameplay and moves are the best I\'ve ever seen for pvp multiplayer and single player Graphics could use some updates and maybe a free crystal. I really like the character called ""White Tiger"" from The ultimate spider-man series... Also there should be better rewards for perfect wins... Where ur character hasn\'t been even touched by another character or when health of ur character is 99%.', ""This game has gotten worse over time, I mean like (GAME OF WAR) bad. Lol At this point I play out of boredom and maybe to see a new character. Telling the app maker your issues doesn't solve anything. So my advice if you decide to play, is to never spend a dime on the game and don't get into it too much. 12-22-19 update, this game still is a POS. The only upside is playing with friends and seeing new characters. You really have no control over the game, when they want you to lose, you lose."", ""I love this game. I play it all the time. And to reply to RayanQuickRats, you can fight other people in alliance wars. I do have one problem though. And that's the Arena Crystal's. Every single time I buy one, it gives me gold. And I've most likely bought 100 in my entire time of playing the game. If you can increase the rate of landing on punisher, I'm pretty I'm not the only one with this problem, but that would be great. Outside of that this game is great."", ""I've been playing this game since I was in 2nd grade, it is a great game because you could collect characters and use them in quests , battles, and you can go through the events and versus modes with them. You could power up and gain more champions with iso-8 and crystals which is a fun addition to the game making you available to be better than others stat-wise. I never lost fun and interest in this game and it is incredible. So for me in my opinion, I would download this game immediately :>:>"", 'I enjoyed the game and the graphics, It wasnt as good as injustice two but had way more characters. I think that it is very hard to get 4 star heroes and above because they just want your money. But I like the game style and their is almost a different ability for each hero. So I think that you should get it, but dont play it alot it you dont want to spend money', 'I have played long enough to acquire the title ancient one 4 year old account. This company is a joke. I spent actual $ to revive my fighters & immediately after I healed them back up the game goes down for emergency maintenance. This happened as I was waiting for the fight to load in alliance war. When I was able to log back in my fighter was dead and the $ I spent to revive & heal was wasted! I contacted customer service & later an email saying there was nothing they could do?

It's because they're quite hungry for money. GREEDY to say it bluntly.) Quite fun to play. It's just that this is not free-to-play. Someone's statistics can be determined on how much he/she spends (what a shame!). Good and well-performing players are kept being matched with premium users from time to time frustrating a lot of players by making the game at a total mismatch. I just can't believe how unbalanced this game is right now. 👎🙅"", ""I very much enjoy the gameplay, but if you decide to play the game without spending a little money your experience will be significantly less enjoyable, and as much as I love wargaming, they've gotten on the randomized lootbox bandwagon. Sure they make money, but they are anti consumer. And if you do want to outright buy a new premium tank, they often cost as much as $40-$50 if they're tire 8 or higher"", ""I absolutely love the game but I am having screen issues with the game display on my Samsung Galaxy S10e. This phone has been out for almost a year and the developers still haven't fixed it. I just sent an email to the developers regarding this issue. It doesn't effect my gameplay it's just it would make the experience all the better to have a full screen to play on and not have a black line across the side of my phone. Other than that, the game is amazing. Till it's fixed it remains 3 stars"", 'The Gameplay of the game is very good, however, the graphics and the inability to balance tanks is annoying. Another annoying thing is that whenever you download a new update, you need to go into the game and download all of the resources AGAIN and the downloader in game is very slow and not optimised for fast internet connections. Most of the tanks in this game are not balanced well enough, eg. The sheridan, smasher, lupus. These tanks are broken. There are also tanks that are underpowered.', ""These missiles have been nothing but trouble. Line-of-sight gameplay and any cover is now utterly useless and the missiles can just hit you on the roof for free HP without any risk whatsoever. I know you intended for a good change with this mechanic but it has done the opposite. Had you not half-assed the implementation of these missiles this wouldn't have happened. Yes I am utterly displeased with this game. Have not started spending on it and you already discouraged me from doing so."", 'Okay so first i must commend you for such a amazing game the controls are fluid, its not ""pay to win"" as the team ballancing seems rather good and the graphics are 😘👌🏻 \'parfait\'. I also love the range of tanks available and that their a limit to what you can upgrade tanks to but.. My only issues are that i\'d like a sort of 1 ""try before you buy"" trial on tanks that are promoted since they are alot of premium currency and some more game modes. Overall though i thank you for your hard work, GG', 'I\'m only giving this two stars. I\'m always put in a lobby allowing me to lose. And I can\'t cheat cause I don\'t know how. But that aside if this is run by AI match making I\'d prefer the game to give more of a fighting chance to the lesser skilled players such as myself. I never get reflected shells off my tanks and I never penetrate even when I use the ""special"" shells. No matter my tank I just can\'t seem to win no matter my strategy kind of a buzzkill', ""I mean. This game is so satisfying. I'll play it w my m8 for hours, and then get bored. But after one hour, my mind wonders back to the game and how good it is! And then I'll of course get back on and play. The balance between premo and reg. Tech tree tanks is ok if the reg tanks are played well.

Thankfully most people don't know how to use them but for those who do they can single-handedly decide the game Secondly their armor it's far too good and troll. These are light tanks shouldn't be bouncing shells this much. 2 stars untill this is fixed"", ""Overall I've played this game for a year and it's good for what it is. Only issue is the packet loss during matches only. On other games requiring more I have no packet loss, but this one has an underlying problem on the game server end. If they can fix this issue I would be most sincerely happy."", ""Wow f me this game has gotten down into the dumps. Ever since the latest update matchmaking is absolutely horrible. Literally every single match I've been put in I've lost. It's pretty clear the matchmaking is rigged. I always check after battles to compare players, and you literally have a team of the most Expereinced players, and then I'm stuck with the noobs. My hard earned account is ruined. Its clear this company is trying everything it can to gain profit. Had enough of this stupid game."", ""Matchmaking is a joke, so does the upgrades, even if you buy the upgrades using in-app purchases, doesn't make any difference. If you lose a match, you lose a lot. Instead of 12 streaks wins, you got 12 streaks losts. Definitely harder to enjoy once you got to the top tiers tanks."", 'Its a very very fun game, but the only downside is some of the tanks a broken, and alot of the time in order to be successful, you gotta pay to win, and thats not any good, i mean its good for War Gaming cause in order to keep the game going, they gotta have micro transactions.', 'great game, cool looking tanks. runs ok on average phones. sorta not free at high levels. you can play the first 3/4 of the game free for real - but at higher levels you NEED to grind to pay for your best tanks. Matchmaking/RNG is rigged against the best and worst players. developers & artists are geniuses!!! sales and leadership at WG are used car salesmen. Its a great great download if you stick to the first 3/4 of the game. Last 1/4 cool too, but not easy.', 'Ok review edit: Not pay to play, but it is pay to win partially. As you get deeper in you start to realize where the insane imbalances are that paying can make a difference. But also they try to get you to spend money on tanks that are often worse or same as normal. If going to pay real money, should be some actual benefit But my huge complaint is the horrible team balancing. And how some of the game mechanics work, or I should say are broken. They need to address the balancing much more.', ""No help what so ever on problems with payment, been locked out of my account for over a week, I do however get an email that's in german, that gets sent to me once a day, same email, which tells me it's automated and not really being looked at.

My internet was find, i know this because my team mates were noving fine and my ping was about 93-120. I think the problem was born from the recent update that you guys did. Love World Of Tanks Bye"", 'Its pay to win. There are free tanks. And premium tanks which you need to pay a lot for. The matchmaking is really bad. You are pared up against people who have been playing for 5 years plus and you also need to pay for a premium account if you need to go up the free tank ladder.', 'I\'m a decent player. I work so hard to get tank upgrades and matches are ruined by fully upgraded premium tanks that 1 shot everything. Cant use smaller tanks. lack of HP, armor, and penetration. Cant progress when the consumables that ""solve everything"" cost the free player everything to use. If you want to play free, dont expect it to be fair or feasible to progress. And if you happen to be a good player you will go against people who\'ve paid 100s on this game. Unfair, uneven. Non skill based.', 'Very fun, very entertaining, great selection of tanks. The only complaint I have is no matter what tank you have it will take a bunch of shots to destroy anything, which gets old. And yes, to destroy a tank its hp must be 0. But to get hp to be 0 you must shoot it over and over and over again, it gets old.', ""Terrible controls, too much data consumption, uninstalled after 2 games and left on phone for a day to be outdated and have to download 500mbs more on top of the 2.5gb used. Uninstalled. Android devices are not computers. Edit: You could simply reuse the fbx files and retexture them, there is no need for this amount of consumptions, it's not a PC game, you don't need High Quality models for each tank. You should reduce the amount of tris and verts and retexture the same models, like many games."", ""The recent missile update nullified the armor mechanics of the game. It's a shame too because otherwise this game was 5 stars before they completely broke the top 3 tiers of gameplay. Grinding to the top tiers is worthless now unless you're grinding the American light line. Edit: now the latest update won't let you filter out undesired game modes. I don't play supremacy. So I guess I don't play WoT now. Uninstalled, won't be back."", 'I personally love this game. It is so much fun, even with the new missile tanks, it has so many elements like figuring out how to play every line of tank. RNG may not favor me but I still enjoy the feeling of causing an ammorack or causing a turret to explode off an enemy tank. Now back to the missile tanks, they do seem quite strong but maybe you can figure out a good way to balance them like a little less penetration with the missiles or less damage.', 'wg. why. why remove half the tech tree. cant you just focus on expanding the tech tree. if you wanted to make a collector status thing, you could have added tanks that arent in the game. like obj 430u you know. Im not even gonna talk about anything else because its no like your gonna listen anyway, also, why did you rework the maps. i dont care. keep ruining your game. i rate 3 stars because of the tech tree.', 'I have played this game since it came out and the updates have been awesome, My favorite update is the most recent one. It makes it easier to get around the garage. I love you guys keep up the good work. I LOVE the new Hella map, also could u guys make it easier to get silver.', ""There is no balance between the two team..one team is so weak and the other team is over powered...

I loved this game...but now hate it..."", ""The game is literally unplayable on Chromebooks. It crashed as soon as I opened it.

I would have rated it 5 stars if it didnt crash on my Chromebook."", ""Complicated game, But I LOVE it! I love that it's not entirely a pay to win game, I mean I haven't spent a penny on it.

I've been f2p on this game from the start, and as much as I love Star Wars, most of the time it feels like I'm grinding and going through the motions, for very little progress. Just know if you intend on being free to play, you'll have to invest years of your life away just to get your characters to 7stars. Also, why do most of the good characters all need the same equipment for leveling up? Spread that out so 30 characters don't need the same items!"", ""Good: it's Star Wars when there isn't anything better for mobile at the moment Bad: Completely pay to win. But you won't need $100, you'd need thousands. The worst value of purchases for any game you'll ever play and it only gets worse with each update. No new content, just more subpar chars for you to farm. And farm you will. I wouldn't recommend starting at this point. The game is on its way out."", ""Decent, but if your a new player it's not worth the time or money. I've been on a few years now, haven't spent any money and it shows. I'm a middling player and that's becuase I won't feed the EA cash machine. If your brand new you can pay $100 to catch up but you won't be close to what you need to complete. It's something I do with a few friends and my brother fun enough without taking much time nothing special."", ""Money is required to get anywhere in upgrading the characters if you want to do it in less than a few years. It literally took me almost two years of literally daily play to unlock master yoda and it would easily take another 2 years to get him to 7 star without buying the packs. It's a fun game but it's pointless unless you buy the packs, the people who do buy have teams that are too strong to compete with. Great concept in the game itself, but terrible when it comes to free playability."", ""Better if you have A LOT of money to spend. While you don't really need to spend a dime. The game really slows down to a crawl. Leveling up takes heros takes YEARS. Be prepared to be defeated, a lot. Even if the level is easy. And you have high point players. Somehow, the computer always wins. I will not suggest this game to anyone who asks!!!"", 'To get new characters there is a very slim chance to get them out of basic ""lootboxes"", otherwise you\'ll have to spend 350 for an increased chance for a character but no guarantees. These crystals take a very long time to accumulate and not getting anyone out of this pack sets you back tremendously. You can also collect tokens that will create characters but missions have a daily limit unless you pay a boatload of gems, so that takes a long time too', ""Pay to Win. Starts out well enough, but you'll soon discover that every character you want is almost impossible to get without investing too much time, or too much money. Just playing the game costs in game currency, and when you run out, you can't play until it replenishes, and even then, you will run out again almost immediately.... For those who have $100 to blow on a cell phone game this will be great fun.... For everyone else.... Well, not so much."", ""Ignores the player base. Introduces new paywalls to make your investments useless. New players have to spend money to remain competitive. The only reasons the game is alive are 1. It's star wars; 2. The players relate on Discord; and 3. The new players to join have to pay to enjoy in the end-game content. The game went downhill since KOTOR and has lost the core player base."", ""Pay to win has grown way out of control. Matchmaking is a problem as it is designed to pit spenders versus free players to encourage spending. Drop rates are awful, again to encourage spending. New content comes out at a snails pace and always has bugs and issues, or they just didn't test it enough. The turn based combat is exceptional. The only reason to play is because it is the only star wars game out there. Disney Heroes: Battle Mode is far superior in every way. My advice, stay away!"", ""This game sucks once you get to the max lvl of 85. Bulding up to that level is great. (Missions are challenging. Pvp is well balanced.) Raids always terrible because you try to build yourself up to get the top prize, but before getting there you get pushed to the next lvl tier and your back at the bottom. I'm now max level. Haven't won a pvp in about a year because opposition knocks out half my squad before I even get a turn. Game feels like pay to win. Get to max lvl then dump this game."", ""Although I love this game, I can not recommend it to any new players. I've been playing for years. It is not new player friendly. The system makes a few characters the meta. Without these few strong characters, you are worthless as a player. The only way to get them is to have teams of other required characters. This requires either years of free to play farming or thousands of dollars of pay to win. The in game store is ridiculously over priced for what you get."", ""I remember playing it a couple of years ago. It was incredibly fun and entertaining. It still is, but back then, I could actually get lots of new characters without paying money. But now it's literally impossible to get any character shards without paying for gems and buying data packs. I mean, you need an 8 star character just to unlock the shard store?!?! Really EA?"", ""This game is fun and interesting for Star Wars fans, the gaming element that lies beneath all elements destroys the fun of the game, when You battle You do not recieve the proposed rewards but a way lower value of the announced. The sim mechanic is nice but destroys the game. You fight and gear Your teams so that You can sim and the reward is that You do not get to play? DO NOT start playing this game if You want to be top player, You'll never catch up to the whales from the initial realeaseday"", ""Graphics aren't great compared to smaller budget games, crashes every now and then, and repetitive gameplay. This wouldn't be too bad if it wasn't so tremendously pay to win. Spill $100 and you can instantly be one of the games top players, or go the old fashioned route and face energy caps, op squads, and slow progress after the beginning. It would be near impossible for a kid (this games target demographic) to have fun for more than 25 minutes without paying money."", ""It's absurd how this game is designed to force players to pay money. And not small amounts. Like, hundreds of dollars per year. You could buy every other Star Wars game ever made *many times over* for the cost of being relevant in SWGOH. Capital Games has little interest in making this game more enjoyable for an average person who can't spend money on a phone game. Disappointing because it's actually a very well designed game, ruined by corporate greed."", 'Do NOT recommend for new players. I\'ve been playing for years and I enjoy the game enough to keep playing, but it takes literal years of daily farming to feel like you are a ""real"" player, unless you want to pay thousands of dollars to get up to speed (the hyperdrive bundle is helpful, but barely a start). If you can inherit an existing account that has a lot of work done, then I\'d say the game is a blast!', ""It all comes down to money. You can't evolve or get better in this game without buy crystals or cards, and then even when you do, its the absolute minimum they can give you. The sell it like it you send this much you spend X amount you can get up to 45k-1m... so you send the money, then they slap you in the face over and over with the absolute minimum 45k over and over. Play the game, its fun. But DO NOT GIVE THEM YOUR MONEY. ITS A MONEY PIT"", 'Amazing game but the rate of farming is ridiculous. The worst part about this game while it is fun and immersive is the cost of spending money is ridiculously high. I haven\'t found a single item worth buying in the game. It\'s crazy how high the cost is. Devs.... Fix it As it stands I will never spend a single dime on this game which is too bad for them because if I could buy a few choice shards or full sets of gear then That would help a lot. Or honestly when you play a level to farm shards then how about f*""\'ing guaranteeing that shard instead of it being a chance all the damn time. And I get nothing', ""This game is fun but most events require u to be level 80+ which is lame. Also the drop rate on character shards seems extremely low. I can use 7 sim tickets and not even get 1 character shard. Developers in my opinion are very greedy and don't seem to care to answer any questions when emailed. I would play other games that are more generous!"", ""Disappointingly geared to people spending a lot of money instead of letting people enjoy it. I don't mind a small purchase, but the game is set up to Target weak people who have tendencies of a gambling addiction. I look forward to EA losing the star wars license, they've just taken advantage of true fans."", 'Its an awesome game. Iff you love or even like star wars play it and enjoy. Im giving it an average rating due to how heavy it favors the PTP and PTW community. Iff you can afford to spend 50 to 100$ a month it greatly would improve your experience. The enormity of the roster and impressive number of events gives you nearly endless options to work on. The size of the the roster again sadly greatly favors those who can afford to play and iff you want to enjoy to play it takes much more.', ""They've ruined this game in just about every way possible. Too bad as it was one of my favorites, now just waiting for their greed to kill it off completely. It's nothing but a pay to win, money grab at every corner, unbearable forced farming joke of a game now. New TB is awful, just laziness on the Devs part. They seem to have forgotten that FUN is the key component to games & this game is no longer fun at all. Truly a shame, but do yourself a favor & don't start playing this game."", 'It\'s a good game if you\'re a Star Wars fan. It does get ""grindy"" after some time, and some good characters are behind a paywall. Gameplay wise, some strategy and thinking us required but gets repetitive over time, pushing you to just auto play it and move to the next objective. Overall, good but not great. Excellent for casual play, but gets boring after extended periods of play.', ""Good F2P game for those who are willing to play for the long-term. Please don't stop developing the game and please continue to add more characters and modes to give the game a little more experience. I love collecting and upgrading my characters! Also, maybe adjust down the difficulty for other players. But overall, I love the game."", ""I like this game for killing time, but refuse to spend real $ which means acquiring gear past lvl 5 is a SLOG and farming characters to 7* to complete events... let's just say I haven't managed it. But what has pushed me to give 3 stars is fricking Galactic War. I have won a campaign exactly once and have tried probably 20 times. I don't know what sort of algorithm decides how difficult to make a campaign but as a lvl 63 ftp mine is so impossible I don't bother trying to win, just get credits"", ""It a lot of fun and I love the game it just there's a lot of characters that are in Star War movie, and shows that are not in the game. Try and bring out all the Star War characters because I would really hate to see that this game would be no longer to play just like Star Wars Arena, also Squad Arena needs work on to. I don't like when it says draw after the when I have a lot more characters alive than my opponent or have more health than they do."", ""Honestly, I enjoy SW: GoH. I haven't had to forcefully buy any MTX just to play, I make progress when I play, and find the game fun to kill time with. Leveling up characters can be grindy, but I never found it impossible. It's best to go into this game as something you chip at little by little. As a game to fiddle with in break at work or laying on the couch, I find it enjoyble without the need to invest anything just to progress."", 'I have been playing for 2 years or more and do enjoy the game but it seems to be more of a money grab now. The gear it takes to move a toon up 1 level starts to get out of hand. For instance, for Han Solo to go from gear level 10 to level 11 would take 13282 crystals. You can purchase 15710 crystals for 99.99 or .00636 cents per crystal. That means it would cost you $84.87 of real money to move 1 character up 1 level (and not even to the highest level). Seems a little ridiculous. Makes FTP rough', ""I love this game. I have been playing it for over 2 years now. But let me tell you this: Capital Games/EA is (as we know) probably one of the worst developers of all time. If you are not willing to spend a MINIMUM of 100€ (and I really mean a minimum) you will be stuck on the dark side of the game, which is farming up bad characters, that you don't need in the future until you get to a point (essentially lvl 85) where the game becomes somewhat playable. Your choice to make..."", ""The developers seem to have lost their way. Poor decision making with metas, and lack of creativity with game modes are the biggest flaws. The last original content was 2 years ago, the rest have been re-skins of what we had. Arena metas have been mirror matches for about the same 2 years. They got rid of the Sr Producer, who did a decent job at keeping the game FTP friendly. And they replaced her with some clown from EA Sports. Oh yea, then there's the slew of game breaking bugs every update"", ""I love playing the game. Graphics are cool and the game is very entertaining. My only problem I have with the game is the gem purchases. The cost of gems is way to high. $20 for 2,000 and $50 for 7,000. I mean who wants to spend $100 for 17,000 gems. The prices are just to high, I would love to purchase more if the prices weren't too much. Just a recommendation cut the cost just a little bit for the gem purchases and I bet more players would be willing to spend more on them. I know I would."", ""Utter Trash! Typical EA Garbage! Pay to win! 😂 God forbid you actually release a product worth paying for! It's an insult to call it a game but hey that's modern gaming for ya 😂 This industry is gonna collapse sooner or later as the industry is unsustainable hence why Micro Transactions are the norm now! Also thanks Disney for destroying one of the greatest movie franchises ever! Go Woke! Go Broke! 😂 bahahahaha Marvels next! 😂"", ""I love(d) this game, but with the recent release of the Hyperdrive bundle, you either pay $100 just to have a chance, otherwise don't bother. The game had slowly become more and more pay to win, now it's just a fact, if you don't want to pay, don't even bother. Still a great collector game if you have deep pockets though."", ""CG owns this game which is, alone, worth negative stars, so guess this is my only option. Do not sign up for this game. Do not spend your money (which is the only way to feel competitive, FTP is a huge joke and we all joke about it) Just avoid it unless you were in it from the start. Trust me when I say a sink like this really doesn't make much of a difference, I'm still well behind in a top guild and will never catch up."", ""Great game p2w though hurts it. I've spent like $50 on it and dont have an issue as I've enjoyed it as much as a retail game and its with me all the time. Most of the pay to win stuff is still accessible through time play but just takes a long time for anyone who wants to play hardcore."", ""I've been playing for 3 years I haven't spent a dime and I still have tons of content to unlock it's fun it's fair and fully customizable teams are a great way to enjoy your favorite star wars characters. however if your shooting for the top, then I would recommend looking up a farming guide for meta teams in the higher levels will save you alot of work later on"", ""Love this game. Only issue I have is with the items needed to upgrade characters. It's set up to where its impossible to upgrade multiple characters gear levels once they hit the 7-8 gear level. I literally have like 10 characters (from same and multiple different factions) needing the same items which take forever to get and you'll also need 50 smaller items to make the one big item you need (even though I am grinding every single day). Its super frustrating and gets stagnant at that point."", ""for one the raids are stupid. part 2 all the ship stuff takes forever and it is lame to. it takes years to upgrade your characters and by then this game is totally boring. all you do is simulate everything. Update. I have very high level characters after a while there is no way to advance them unless you spend money. im now done with this game forever. 🖕 You won't see a dime from me. If I'm going to spend money it will be on xbox. 🖕🤘✌️"", ""good graphics, and lots of cool characters to get. This is the perfect star wars game. I love how the battles are and how the battle animations look. All updates are great. You don't have to pay for any cool features. I love star wars and all the lore. Im so glad that there is a game with a bunch of the most known characters. The abilities for the characters are super cool too. There are some characters like jango fett who is not in it. But that doesn't change much. I highly recommend this game."", 'The investment in this game is immense. The devs work hard evolving it. As in 99% of games, if you want to pay you progress much faster, However be warned buying your way to the top takes BIG pockets of cash. Without paying it is still fun but it takes a long long time to make progress. You will however always be cannonfodder for pay to win players.']"

Don't waste your time, just skip this and play a game that has some aspect to it other than spending your hard earned cash."", ""Pay to win game. Constant spending to keep up. Dont play unless you have $1000's of dollars to throw away monthly. There is no way to even survive unless you spend. Every new item that comes out is only current for a short time.

In the city view, when I tap on the chat, it opens items, quests, or whatever located below. The UI is also stretched vertically. It all can be fixed by minimizing and restoring the app. Older bugs haven't gone, too many of them to describe here. What else? Monetization model is ugly - all the stuff in $5-packs is totally obsolete. I don't need anything of it and I can't see other (more expensive) packs that may contain things I need"", ""Strategy changes frequently due to programming changes.

Got to a decent rank then it slowly and steadily fell apart. I'm trying a different approach this time and so far appears to be working. Could I just say, Build, build, build up before expansion of the radar first. Current radar at level 6 or 7. 👍😁👍"", ""Awesome game, regularly updated and works flawlessly and its a great casual game, easy to spend just 5 min or 50 min in game. Have played it for many years since it first came out and its only gotten better with time. The Warships mode isnt for me personally, but I'm still glad they continually try to innovate and make the game better than it used to be. The play style is extremely flexible, literally a style for everyone, even the pacifist who doesnt like fighting, just harvest your resources."", ""update sucks! everyone you get paired up with is grossly better equipped than you are. totally unfair way they match you up with opponents.update. I posted this a while ago and this issue still hasn't been fixed, especially when you get a new engine room. I'm constantly getting matched up with people who are 4 or 5 spots higher than me on the upgrade tree."", ""It's a pretty fun game; I've been playing it for 2 years or so. It's a cute distraction. 6 months ago I the game would crash suddenly, saying that the server had become disconnected. And I would lose whatever progress I was making in a battle. Very frustrating. The developers should fix this glitch, or at least give us a win for every battle that we start before the system glitches out."", 'The game as a whole is ok. Unfortunately, the devs of late have been lapse. The gameplay of warship is unfair, you constantly get put against opponents that are far stronger and have unlocked warriors and abilities you do not possess, there is no way to win. I will no longer be playing the warship part of the game and will no longer spend any money on the game as a whole. Congratulations...', 'The game is fun but i wish we could play a mini game that would cost coins or gold. You would drop something and it the ball you dropped would collect points if it touched the point bubbles and whatever it adds up to would be the amount of time it takes away from what you are upgrading or the amount of time with training the soldiors.', ""You got a little better with the Warships, but still see the problem when i defeated another player's warship with a quicker time, and you still award them the victory. A new problem...Capt. Spark...I target a building with the flare, but when I try to hack that targeted building, it hack's something else. I know it can't hack special weapon buildings and buildings that can't defend themselves. FIX!"", ""FIX THE GLITCH! In the WarShip you are no longer able to win any chests. The ones down on the bottom left-hand corner do not count anymore when you win. They remain the same. I've lost so much reward from that glitch. I've uninstalled and reinstalled the application and i'm still not getting the reward. It's been about a month now without ANY reward."", 'very fun very fresh and very addicting. This game has so many different things about it that makes it a great game. My favorite is how easy it is to build a great base in such little time. There are no bugs, glitches, or crashing. This is a well-rounded encentric game and I recommend to anyone looking for some leisure time that is worth while or for anyone who wants to experience an action packed yet calming game.', ""I enjoy the original game, and like the idea of the warships portion of the game. Unfortunately the warship portion tends to be drastically mismatched and getting worse rather than better. I even stepped away altogether for a while over it. Hopefully you'll figure this problem out before I just delete the game from my phone completely."", 'So as you build the base it becomes exponentially difficult. If you use real money to get in game resources, your base can get destroyed and whatever money you are saving up goes away. That means, you may be trying to upgrade your buildings, units and you spend real money. You are going to be attacked before you can upgrade and then you just lose real money just to hand it over to a different player and robbed. Gonna contact my card company to get my money back.', ""Very fun but my only problem is I can't really. Enjoy my resource islands to the full extent I could've, three of mine are stale mates like permenantly I guess cuz they are lvl 4 while I'm already a lvl 31so idk if the other players quite the game or something but I wish I could fight someone back and forth for them again, kinda lost some charm in the game."", ""Warships is no good for seasoned players. I've played every season so far.. and it's impossible to get going. I and many others are just stuck throwing matches until we drop down to a reasonable level. And then what? We all just race to get the heavy helicopter? Wow.. that was fun at first, but it's really taken actual creative playing out of the game."", 'This game is AMAZING!!! It is so fun and omce you get to hq level 8 you can do so much and it doesnt take long to get there. There is so much to do too. You can join task forces (join mine its bombs awayyyyyyyyy) but you also have a alter base with all the best defenses and offesnes and you just battle and unlock rewards. And in task forces you start operations which everyone in the force works together to beat the 2-7 bases. I would defintly recomend this game.', ""It's fun, but has some issues. The first is that you can get attacked by people way stronger than you. I just got my base destroyed by someone 2 levels above me, they had zooka's and way more soldiers and I can't even attack them back when I have better stuff, they are just gone with 5 hours of base raiding worth of resources. Thank you, for ruining my day the second it starts, someone had to do it I guess"", 'It is not a bad game, but after awhile, it got boring. There was nothing really new and it almost was a chore, not a pastime or fun game. I almost feel bad about deleting it, and if you love strategy, it is for you! I am just not much of a strategy guy. EDIT: I have come BACK to the game and it is super fun with the addition of Warships! Nice job! They are adding new troops and keeping the game a bit more interesting. GLITCH: I destroy a Warships base 2 seconds before my opponent, and they win!', ""This season's warship is by far the worst. I think maybe I destroyed 8 engine room's, after probably 60 to 70 attacks. Tried getting my 3rd engine to see if it got any better, but NO. At least last season, it was a race to see who could destroyed all the engine room's first. On a good note, the Mega Crab is great."", 'Every single time I try to get to rank 16 in the warship battle thing I always have people who destroy all engine rooms in less than 40sec and they all have everything unlocked while I cant even compete, this always happens when I get to about 10 stars away from rank 16. I lose 4 times in a row then have to try again. This has happened 4 times in the past hour.', 'I loved playing this game and was in a GREAT task force until the update in December. Now I cant play it because when I open it, it closes and says"" unfortunately boom beach has stopped"". I\'ve tried uninstalling it and reinstalling it several times and it still does the same thing. I\'ve tried EVERYTHING!!!!! Thanks for taking the game away from me supercel', ""Enjoyable game with annoying bug - if I lose signal, even if I get signal back a few seconds later it won't let me actively continue the battle I am in, the battle just continues on its own. This is most annoying in warship if I lose signal before deploying troops as it means I automatically lose as I can't go back to the battle and deploy then - even when I get signal before the battle has finished. Not sure if this affects others too? Makes playing very frustrating in places with poor signal."", 'Best game ever but I purchased diamonds purchase went through but never received the diamonds and it is a hell of a task to email supercell to rectify the issue. They sent you to their Apple site which is really not any help just for this I am thinking of deleting the game. They need to work on their support system seriously', ""I've been playing for 3yrs now so take my word that If there was a 0 star rating i would have used it.Don't even bother downloading this game coz it sucks. Imagine a level 65 raiding a level 30. To can't even do nothing, you can't attach coz the map is full of players whose bases would crush your troops in seconds. Very unfair game. I advise you go and download a different game coz this one is just poor. Very poor game balance, giving the strong players and the pay to win guys a huge advantage."", ""Fun game until mid levels then the opponents become so hard. 10 to 12 levels higher then you. No way to defeat them. don't understand why they would make a game you can't play because your opponents are to high so your only choice is to shut it off and do something else. Seem counter productive. The game is unplayable at this point. just do not play for a few months to get your opponents back down to your level and I mean do not turn this game on for months."", ""Warships again become a farce. Rather than being about troop selection, tactics and skill. It again is just a case of who can fire their guns the fastest. Very disappointing again. Thought this would have been resolved as every previous season has been like this, but alas, this season is the same. It's just a waste of time playing the Warship side of the game"", ""I have been playing this game since maybe 2015, and it was great alllll the way up until NOW. This game is controlled in ways I never knew til now. I'm really starting to notice alot of weird things about this game. Warships is one, it's like no matter what i do and how fast i get done the opponent seems to ALWAYS win, it's RIDICULOUS!!!! With all that said I am gonna separate myself, because I don't feel like I'm getting a fair chance. So I HAVE TO uninstall."", ""I have enjoyed this game for over a year now. It's slow paced with lots of waiting for things to build but you can progress without spending money. The recent warships update is a huge letdown. You end up in some really frustrating loops where you just win and lose and don't progress. When season 2 started I went 1 win, 1 draw and 8 losses to start the season. Complaining will only get you canned but polite answers. It's an update that actually makes me want to play less. A waste of your time."", 'Good game but need alot of improvements, i got a draw acouple of times on the new battleships mode and how is that even possible when i have destroy the opponent and have even watch when opponent still has 1 engine to destroy and i still get a draw???! Needs to fix that getting anoyed with that', ""Great game, an upgraded alternative to Clash of Clans. I had this game before, but I re downloaded it. I recommend it to anyone who plays other Supercell games. However, I have a bug that stops new bases becoming available for me to attack and submarine dive spots don't appear as often as they should. Otherwise, great game. Keep up the great work Supercell!"", 'Chromebook support has been restored in the November update. Plus they have finally added additional levels for those of us who have been maxed out for the past three years. The game is alot of fun for those who are just starting out. It can be alot of fun even if you dont put money towards the game. Buying the instant troop for $10/month is a fun upgrade since it will allow you to really grind in the game.', ""Game bacome laggy. On entry and mid range devices (also older devices)the game play isn't as smooth as it is used to be. Unfortunately in the menu there is no option for reducing graphics. i recommend if you can't fix the situation at least put an option to reduce graphics for older or weaker devices. If this is not much to ask. I have 4 different devices that i can't play the game smoothly on them."", ""warships was a great way to expand the gameplay. And I enjoy watching my base grow stronger over time. Very intuitive and strategic gameplay. Supercell has a knack for doing extremely well in the app/mobile game industry . I only complain that I cannot get my Google play games to connect. But that's a personal issue and has nothing to do with the development teams amazing work and doesn't make the game any less enjoyable and fun."", ""Love the game! Every improvement makes a big difference and a more rewarding experience. Thank you Creators of Boom Beach. Keep up the great work!!! Update#2... I had a rough time with the Warship game but I'm here to say I really like it! Every season is getting better. The only thing I have a problem with is the beggining when you have to fight with the infantrymen.its so hard to win with them. But all's well with boom Beach and I love it!!"", 'This is a great game wish you could buy it. What a rip-off to want me there pay 99.00 dollars for fake crystals. I love this game but not the purchase part of none real items. Let me buy the game and find the things I need. My console game are not even 99.00 dollars. There is so many other ways that do this, it all the purchases not just the 99 dollar one. Thanks. Why do I lose progress on bases I can not defend', 'Game was good at one time. Now they try to make it almost impossible to defend to keep people playing. Instead of improving an equal part defense/offense, they launch warships which is terrible. Game used to be so fun. Now everything geared toward money. The new stuff getting too stretched. Sad to see it go. Task force players almost non existent anymore', ""The game is incredible well made, very entertaining but it is drown back by the thing that it's entirely pay to win. You can play free of charge but you need to be a veeeeery patient person and play for years to reach high levels. I understand that the developers needs to gain some money from this, that they don't work for free but in this game it's just ridiculous. The game its made in such way that it forces you to pay so you won't loose what you worked for such a long time."", 'Loved this game for a while. Thought the new battleship idea would be awesome. Then i find out that the game and designers have no problem with cheaters. I brought it to the attention of the support group and all they said was, ""unfortunately we can\'t help you with that, contact us if you have questions regarding a different subject.... Genius....😒🙄', 'Ive been playing for 5 years. It was fun, and very very addictive, which is the only thing that kept me going. This game is only for people who can spend money on premium currency. I cant, I wont. Boom Beach just wants your money, the developers always have these stupid offers, and i mean ALWAYS. In warships the matching system is ok, but when i destroy their engines or whatever before them, usually 10-20 secs, they still win. Cruel, and stressful. Dont play, if you cant pay. The devs dont care.', 'Without a doubt the worst season of warships. The fully upgraded rifleman, which used to be formidable, is now brought down by anything. The warrior wont go under tje smoke to a target and if he does defenses keep shooting like theres no smoke there. So i have troops that drop if u yell at them facing fully upgraded defenses. No way to win let alone destroy 8 engines to get upgrade tokens. Quit playin cause theres no point. I was an everyday player, a spend money player. No more', 'Great game, great graphics, gameplay is solid my only complaint would be for the warships that the date till the next worship is available would not be so long I like playing the worship as is. I feel that waiting about a week is too long.', ""This a great game of you are looking for some challenge and strategical game!! Whether playing on warship or in task force, there is always something to do. The only problem there is that it's hard to make changes to your bases, after you get new buildings. Please consider adding an edit mode where you can edit freely and easily.""]"

Adjustment and optimization on functions","['Game is full of bugs and when people post bad reviews in the app store, developers always come with the same answer. I have reported some bugs through the Mod section and all they do is keep asking new questions and never resolve. And why the whole censure thing? People keep complaining but developers just don\'t care about English speaking people. Words like ""game"" and ""is"" are forbidden while the Chinese can say all they want. The response right now from the developers is again not helpful', ""It's an entertaining game and if you have a year and £1000 spare you can almost contend with others! I have spend over five years on clash but in the last year have hardly played it. Development have censored basic words making it very hard to hold a conversation. Greed is still prevalent from the developer and it's really very boring. If you are under attack and log in you will need to navigate the three adverts for gold before you can reshield.

Or just keep pumping money into it and live under a bubble"", 'Love this game into my 5th year of playing. Not happy with all the new gaming options. Too many too fast and no time to learn them.

All actions are maped except movement. Kind of counter productive when you still have ro touch the screen to move. Make the improvement and ill be happy to edit and make 5 star. Overall a wonderful game.', 'Very fun very addicting. Reading some of the other reviews and how people have difficulty playing the game almost discouraged me from spending my money. But it is worth every penny and I do enjoy the challenge it is indeed very much a strategy game. My only criticisms are once a lot of action is going on I had to downgrade the level quality to maintain frames. I like the controller support but when I go to remap buttons it sets everything to the left stick before I can press a button.', ""First, I want to reiterate that this is a hardcore strategy game. Those expecting a hack n' slash type game will fail. Success takes planning and effort. Victory is well earned and satisfying. The game itself is pretty amazing. It gets your blood pumping and adrenaline going. It's intense. Armor crafting could be better, in that i'd like to choose my armor as opposed to getting a random (but better) set. Collision detection could also be better. Graphics are AMAZING. Sound is decent. 5/5"", ""Difficulty is ridiculous but that made it fun for me. Instead of this being one thing trumps all I was forced to try out different styles and strategies.

After every wave, the next wave starts coming again immediately. Although there are several wait times it is not enough to gain points for upgrades. The difficulty increases suddenly and the skeletons with shields are almost unkillable. The pikemen which counter them are far too weak to be effective in combat. So the game overall is quite unbalanced and I would not recommend it for casual players.', ""Very good game. Well balanced and challenging. It IS challenging but it's not at all pay to win. I have beaten the game without using gems before (this was before I purchased gems) people that say it's too hard need to rethink their strategy. Their is definitely a trick to this game ;)"", 'One of the most amazing games on the play store.

That said, the game by itself is so much fun that this is the first game that I have bought in the play store (free in ios)-yet the online community is dead. Please make the game free, develop the multiplayer, and make it cross platform. This comment might be ignored but I hope for change.', ""The game is amazing if you're looking for a challenge and constant action, there is a leveling system and much more I recommend this app to those who love action and strategy games"", ""The game is quite hard in the beginning. The time played to reward ratio is terrible. Not enough points rewarded to upgrade the hero and units. Consider adding a camera adjustment options. The screen gets too cluttered and becomes hard to see. It's a work in progress but I hope the devs continue to improve the game"", ""Outstanding concept, graphics and sheer amount of content. For those whining that it's too hard: I purchased gems in the game only to support the developer ( and discard the gems at blacksmith). There is actually well enough units in the game that I play with 1 hero faction and only use the corresponding units - so with Elf for example, I'm forced to fight alone for a long while until I unlock elvin units. This is just a game mode I created from the endless potential this game has to offer."", ""honestly one of my favorite games of all time. Edit: I have had a problem where my recent purchases haven't been restored after uninstalling and reinstalling the game any recommendations?"", ""This game is a very fun game and it's easy st the start but then gets quite hard ad you go on but keep trying different ways and troops Also get atleast one dwarf and one elf as heros"", 'The game is fun at first, but at wave 9 it just gets impossible. If there is nore balancing this is five star.', 'Pretty good game, fun, challenging, unique and overall and enjoyable experience.', ""This game is , in my opinion, phenomenal! A ton of different allied characters and enemies to go with it. But their are some problems with it. 1. The game pad stops working at times and becomes really annoying at times. 2. The game itself crashes. It's only happened twice now, for me atleast, but still. 3. As a note to new players: Upgrade the crystal and your units -> the crystal unlocks newer characters which can be upgraded, and this can help a lot."", ""U have to keep spending money to pass some wave. But even u spend money to buy gem, After few wave it's become crazy harder. So this is the way they let u spend more money. If u can keep spending money to this game then u can download this and play, if not then just don't start it."", 'Just amazing. One of the best mobile games ive ever played. And the things you xan buy are cheap. And optional.', 'Those who complain about this game being too hard... grow a brain Good game overall not many out there like it, bit like a breath of fresh air👍', 'I played Heroes and Castles and loved it... then I played Heroes and Castles 2 and was amazed that they not only kept up with the high standard of the first game, but improved upon it. Excellent game. It does crash every now and then, and I hope that gets fixed, but this game is definitely worth the $1.99. And I very rarely pay for games on my phone, but I would have paid twice as much for this game. Worth.', 'Excellent gameplay, with I could earn points faster but non the less great work keep it up', ""Absolutely fun! The first Heroes was already very fun. It's great they built upon it to increase more hours of gameplay and progression!"", 'At first I thought this game is a worthy successor of the first one. But it\'s not. You\'re constantly forced into fighting stronger defensive battles and don\'t even have enough time conquering any side points AND defending them as well (because everything can get attacked). Let alone searching for treasures. Stupid mechanics that force you to do something (""you have to defend this town""). This way it\'s really hard to actually level up additional heroes. Not balanced at all.', 'This is the best mobile game I ever played I love the concept of the game, I would love it if you added the option to play as the dark side.', 'Awesome environments with an epic, medieval feel. Worth the price. However, its obvious the dev wants you to buy crystals as the difficulty is obscene, with the AI throwing armored units at you like crazy, and very few units of your own to counter. I switched to easy mode and still have trouble making headway.', 'I see a lot of complaints that this is ""too hard"" and ""p2w"". Let me start by saying no, it\'s not, that\'s completely untrue. Now, that being said, it\'s Gods awfully frustrating and grindy, but rewarding. Nothing is better than when you\'ve spent hours building up multiple heroes to see them own the battlefield side by side. Worth the purchase. To date I\'ve only spent to buy the game iap is completely optional, no p2w. I\'ve gained premium currency easy enough. Excellent job Devs!', ""The game is pretty good but it can get grindy at times, right now I'm almost at the final castleas all i have left to do is grind the waves in the main castle away. The game as of now is pretty dead multiplayer wise and i can see why some would just refund the game after a little once they get stuck on a wave. Personally a sige mode would have been great for the game and if it was way less grindy like the first one. I just hope if a third cimes out it would take some of the good aspects from the first and combine it with the this."", 'There are so many good things about this game that I cant fit into the 500 char limit, but this game is just so amazing! I like how much they changed how everything works compared to the first one! I was half tempted to give it a 4 star though because I bought a 4.99 gem pack and i didnt get my gems, but I felt like this game still deserved a 5 star and didnt deserve to get ruined over 5$ haha, keep working and updating this! AMAZING GAME!!!', ""This game is amazing!! I've been looking for a game where you can level up your hero, build and upgrade troops, and upgrade your castle. There's also different paths along the tree for Humans, Elves and Dwarfs that will definitely keep you satisfied. This is a 5-Star quality game."", ""Loads of fun, very challenging. However I recently encountered a game breaking bug. The game thinks my new phones fingerprint scanner is a controller, and will not show on screen controls. I can't play my favorite game anymore. Please fix this I spent good money on this game!"", 'AMAZING UPGRADE! This game is a great step forward compared to the first H&C.The graphics are a bit blocky, but its worth the smooth gameplay and the months of content you get with your purchase. The fighting mechanics are simple yet fun, and the customization options for your gear and skilltree keep the game interesting.I only really disike that the campaign feels like a constant tutorial by making stages impossible without certain troops .I really want the free will to run my army how I want.', ""I can't seem to pass many levels, the first levels are spot on but the rest are nearly impossible. I have gotten bored fighting the same hard levels over and over again and losing."", 'No More Players Online. Can you guys revive this game Multiplayer?

The screen only show '' download error n not connected to any network''.. The heck not connected🙄🙄🙄"", ""Some unrecognized flaws:? Field of view is hideous, where you either memorize the map or you can't see or react regularly to what comes next. More screenspace is needed to see what really is going on. The annoyance of unchangeable character direction swap which has killed me too many times now. Where is the button for it? Not exactly synchronised action scenes and map layout. Sometimes the way you jump, the space between objects are just too not-forgiving. Just a few, repetitive soundtracks."", ""The first game I've played was Rayman Jungle Run so it was amazing, magical graphics, nice soundtracks and an extraordinary gameplay of course. Now I try this one and as a result.. I can say I definitely love these Rayman's games especially this one. Similar to JR just that with a different enviroment and new levels but with the same comfortable and relax gameplay. I think it was a good purchase. Best wishes Ubisoft."", 'Love this game but reinstalled to finish the levels I didnt yet (nightmare mode) and find I have to start from the beginning.

Please help me , thank you!', 'Overall a solid game but it would be nice if you would make this game usable on Android TV.', ""Good game, good art, smooth controls and framerate on most devices. Delivers a solid Rayman experience on the go. Perfectly beatable without microtransactions while still providing a challenge, though I'd much prefer their absence like in Jungle Run. Since this is an older game it unfortunately doesn't appear to be optimized to run on wider than 16:9 displays. It does fill the entire screen, but cuts off the top and bottom part it seems (not of ui), leading to occasional gameplay frustrations."", ""Changed to 5 stars because although the game is sluggish on my Teclast T8 tablet, it works well not only on my phone but on my Android TV box with the remote, and looks great on both phone and TV. Difficulty is just right for a challenge without being too frustrating, and there's lots of content. Even though it's a 2 button affair, it feels like a full Rayman game. Very well done game, I only wish it worked at normal speed on the tablet."", ""The second best Rayman mobile game. Controls just as well as Jungle Run. The graphics are way over the top and doesn't make the game run as well on a Huawei P20 Lite. But it's just a case of having low power hardware, and there's always the power saving mode. Nonetheless, give this one a go."", 'Brought this for the Nvidia Sheild TV. No longer compatible.', 'Great game. Reminds me Rayman Origins with short-runner style gameplay with loads of powerups to make the game easier. Badly, there is no boss battle and tougher nightmare mode (once fail, back to level 1 again which I frustate and skip it). Still, this is so nostalgic and fun with cheaper price.

The graphics are amazing. There were no viruses, glitches, errors, or any other malfunctions in the game for me. If you love sniper or shooting games you will love this!! I 100% recommend this! * note that since this is a sniper/ shooting game there is expected violence in this game. Therefore it should not be rated 1 star by that. This game is wonderful!!!!!"", ""There might be 100+ missions, but the shock was: it's the same mission with the same individuals going on. Probably at higher levels they will add more guards or something, but so far it is the same thing over and over. Second, this is a paid game, although a cheap one, but it will spam you with offers to buy things with cash comparable with the worst free games."", ""I'm not one for shooting games (I'm a puzzle card game type person) but when I was forced to watch an ad in one of my other usual games that's when I saw this game and I decided to download it. I AM ABSOLUTELY ADDICTED to this now. I watched a couple YouTube videos to show me how to play different levels and I just think it's so much fun killing off the bad guys. I like the sound effects especially. If you are looking for something different and fun try this game out."", ""This is the best game ever. The graphics are very good but just need some improvement and the speech is outstanding. The words/phrase used in this game helps people to increase their vocabulary. I would like to suggest is that add more complicated words and more speech in this game.. that's all"", ""Totally awesome game. With that said, its lacking in so many areas. I love the progression but the fact that the map never changes it gets boring. The same domino kills (only 2 btw). All of the possible targets never change routine. So after about 2 weeks of playing for me you know every possible way to get a high score. What's really sad is this game came out almost 5 years ago and there is only 6 chapters. All I have to look forward to now is climbing the leaderboard (pay to climb)"", ""A truly fabulous FPS game. Graphics are incredible, and the controls are quite sensitive, meaning you have to have your target well set in your sights. The female voice (supposedly the woman overseeing the operations) lends a James Bond type of flavor to all of this. You have a large number of missions, each different in approach. You have to pick the correct weapon for each one. I can still play this game for a few hours at a time. Can't beat this one."", 'Its really interesting, having more options like maps and more instructions on alternitives just in case your committed and suddenly the plan changes also the hit man should have some sort of movement. Ill post more later but i think this game deserves an honest shot, after all if it was too easy....Boring.I actually are frustratinly enjoying it.', ""I would've thought a game on a phone would be low resolution and the controls would've been aggravating, as they are on so many others. But this one is an exception. Controls are great, graphics are great, sound fx are great, this game is addictive! Well done!"", ""Loved the game. It gets challenging with every mission. But there are some things that I'd like to recommend for the game. Number one, the missions should be varied, like a helicopter chase and 47 trying to fend off the attackers. Basically missions should be unique and have some sort of story to it. The missions are always at Montenegro and should have other locations as well. I'd be glad to see that happen."", 'The game was good but not worth the money. Needed something more. Like new locations. New targets. New missions. Just a single location with multiple objectives with same targets is not enough a 5 star rating. At least when it is a paid game and takes upto 1 GB. So, there is a scope of a some improvements. Then only it is a good game.', 'Simple fun game with apparently ""one level"" only, it gets a little repetitive but it makes sense because this is a ""high score"" game repetition and timing are a key factor for this type of games. the sniper experience is flawless. My only complaint is that your score is manipulated, I remember having the same score for a few weeks and some days I was in the top 1,900 and the next day I was 1,075 then I was 2,000 then 1,050 all this changes back and forward with the same score 🤔.', 'Very fun for a month, with only one map, game gets really boring real fast since you are doing same thing over and over and over. You made money?then time to make other maps, if this game had like 5 different maps, this game would be top 5 ranked game in google game list. Sad it is not for many years.', ""Ok. To be extremely honest, the game is actually extremely fun. Although it's really grindy (which is a style i like) to upgrade weapons and all, it really falls off because of the fact it's all one map. I want to see progression in not only the guns but in the actual mission itself. I want to see something in the background change, I want a new map, new enemies, new abilities so I can always find or discover something new. Doing the same thing over and over at a slow rate is not all that fun."", ""Sorry but I changed my mind. The game is way too repetitive. Every mission has everything but the objectives the same. Same guard and high profile targets pattern, same pattern of civilians. I don't mind if it happens in the same location but the game becomes very boring at some point. You just snipe the same targets each stage, it's no different than the one before it. Bullet drop and travel time are so unrealistic. The good sniper rifles are all paid, not good for a game that's already paid."", 'Really fun game(concept), but it is like a long drawn out demo with repatively laying out missions on the same small map scene. Could be alot better if there were large variety of map areas and more interactive gameplay. Eg. Possibly ability to change location during gameplay(even with staying a stationary shooter/ change location-angle) could be an interesting feature. Every level is basically the same gameplay with the same scene, it needs further objectives than score and kill type.', 'I like this game very much, just: please add more maps, and i want you to make that bullet view when you shot and you can see the bullet going through head or another body part of character that it needs killed. Please. Thank you and Good luck. A well done game.😍😍', ""I wish I knew there is only 1 map before I've purchased this game. It's extremely repetitive, new challenges don't make much impact on the gamellay, it's still the same level with the same targets. I wish Play Store had a refund timer based on in-game time rather than the real-world time, now I can't even refund it."", ""This is a great addition to the Hitman series. Just like the console/PC games, there are multiple ways to go about completing your objectives, and the graphics are great. If you've ever played a Hitman game trying to be as stealthy as possible and liked it, you'll like this game."", ""It's a pretty decent game and I recommend it if you want to play a decent sniper game. But This game didn't allow me to add friends or connect to Facebook . The developers have to fix this issue. I would have gave it 5 stars if they fix this issue"", ""Don't believe the people writing that they are getting bored after some time. The game gets more and more difficult as you complete tasks. Also, the guns are updated with new and interesting power ups as the game progresses. All in all, it is a wonderful and an amazing game. Download without thinking twice."", 'Superb game but could have been better if there were other new places and bit more variety missions ...all the time they are giving the mission to kill the same man and that makes this game a little boring ...it has a really good gaming experience..please add more maps and more variety missions ..i hope they see this and answer soon ....', ""It's exciting, rewards patience and creativity, and despite not having a lot of options to provide variety, things can feel different enough from mission to mission."", ""very grindy and there's only one sniper map, the weapons you get by playing are very generic and don't have the cool attacks the paid snipers have, and upgrading them is incredibly slow and tedious, the zombie mode suffers from the same grind and upgrade problem, its just slow. All this ruins the game for me, which sucks cause its one of the best original mobile games, none of the other sniper games i tried ever came close to it, it just sucks the mobile market has to be like this."", ""It's very good and kind of realistic...gives you chill & literally exhausts you!!! But the one and only drawback is that it only happens in one place.You get too much used to it.You know every guards location,when he will move out or what he will do.This gives you and upper hand and makes the game easy and causes lost of intrest."", 'I would give it many more stars but having only one map and a stupid shooter zombie mode it soon gets boring. The characters walk the same route every game, so within a few plays you know how to kill everyone and in what optimal order. The developers dont seem to want to make new levels or maps, just tweak the graphic overlay of the guns and charge lots of money for them.', ""Very good game, Add feature to buy special weapons with blood money and remove the increase blood money when you have to skip a mission, Have a 3 day trial, events ect for us to use the longsword Sniper for free, if not then make it where when you buy longsword Sniper with the coins, add new weapons, people who hack the Game, find there high score and remove it from the leader board, add 2 new maps, fix bugs with knock back the security guard teleport and get instant detection, the I'll give 5⭐"", ""You guys have one of the best sniper shooters for mobile. But like many people before me have stated, y'all need to add more levels for both modes ASAP. Montenegro and Death Valley are good maps by design and what not, it just seems really lackluster to be stuck on those 2 stages for the entirety of the game. Especially when you're constantly grinding/farming for all the same bullshjt for not much different items. This has potential to be the best sniper game, hands down. Just give us new levels"", 'Excellent graphics . The feel and vibes of the intro music is excellent. Just the sniper game i had been searching for. It would be an immense pleasure to play this game if you added some physics like wind movement, distance , humidity... Overall , a game i would recommend to my family and friends.', 'Make sure you read the privacy policy and terms and conditions before you play. Personally, really concerned on the amount of data it ask for permission to collect including financial data, date of birth etc. Not comfortable sharing this with a company I know nothing about so now deleted the app.', 'It is a fun game, but I am not a fan of the controls. You have to tap the edge of the screen to exit the scope, but the shoot button is also located at the edge. This makes it quite annoying when trying to shoot, but instead you will end up exiting your scope and lose your window of opportunity.', 'It is fun in the beginning, but then it becomes repetitive. I wish there were different locations or something to spice it up. If they start changing locations and patterns of the people then I will redownload it.', ""This is a good game with great potential but it's wasted. There's only one map for every single goddamn mission, it's very generic and gets boring after a while. Wish we could move around or just have more maps and more to do. A lot of potential wasted, still a great game nonetheless for what it is."", ""ever since I first downloaded this game I've been able to get my aggression out through killing all the enemies on the same level this game but that doesn't matter because the game gets pretty intense overtime even if I have to kill every single enemy over and over should be done with the game then shall it be done I'm number one"", 'I Want More Chapters. Please add Something New in it... I already completed it 2 times and want to play it again n again. The game is just awesome. Fantastic work on gameplay and Strategic Kills. I Loved It. Please some new character, maps & chapters. I love the way Diana confirming kills & tells about the characters and precision. ❤️❤️ please add something new in it', ""I love the game hitman and hitman 2 ,and hitman sniper is the first hitman game in a mobile. And it almost have the same graphics as the original hitman which I love it. The only problem for which I gave 4 stars is that the maps are always same and the targets which we have already killed becomes alive somehow and we have to kill them again other than that it's the the perfect mobile sniper game for a gamer like me."", ""So the game goes by this: You are a Hitman and you have these snipers you collect and do these missions. Pretty normal, however I wouldn't recommend it to anyone since it costs money and also, there is only 1 MAP and not maybe people to kill. The best snipers cost real money and so on. The game has good potential however it really sucks with so much App Purchases and that you CANT MOVE and stay in this position for then the whole game! Game is overall good graphics, just bad missions and maps..."", 'I am giving 4 stars because most of the guns needs to be bought using real money. That is not so good feature. You have to make some good powerful guns for free too. Overall I love this game. Real experience. Also make new maps. Sometimes it is boring to play the same map over and over. Love the game 😘😘.', 'I love the game its like you really agent 47 very good graphics very good gameplay.salute to the developers just one thing.can u add more places to the game because sometimes its kinda boring if yours always on the same place just that all i can say.SALAMAT......', ""Fun game that offers interesting challenges and asks for creativity and strategy. However, one might feel that more could be don't for it as a puzzle game. The gun system is also lackluster. There's not a whole lot of variety."", 'This game is not fun at all. It only has one place. Sometimes the target is the same person. I was only able to play this game for 3 days only because of the game is so boring. Better snipers need to be bought at a high price.']"
