The great thing about it is there are no ads!! When your playing a game on that game there's no ads, you get to text your friends and play with them. But, the thing is you can only have 200 friends.

First of all, the moderation is HORRIBLE and many people get away with either illegal things, innapropiate actions, violating the terms and services, and innocent people getting banned!

I absolutely love the features and the secure safety chat to prevent arguments and incidents from coming! I do love the social experience and I do wish this amazing game shouldn't get banned in March!

It also includes a special chat to talk with friends without having to join a game! This deserves 5 stars, without a doubt! Keep updating this!💕"", ""It is an amazing game. There are only two things that I wish were different. I wish that the game, Bloxburg didn't cost Robux.

Dont judge the game by just playing 4-5 starting stages .', 'This game is very addicting. The music is subtle yet fits the game well. The graphics are awesome, the movements are good and buttons to perform jumps and attacks very responsive. This game is challenging and entertaining. Would recommend to a young kid to even an adult..', ""Graphics are good and gameplay is solid. Wish you could hold the throw shuriken button. One problem I have is that a lot of the time, checkpoints are so far apart that, when I die, it feels like I'm being sent halfway across the level, and it gets annoying real quick."", 'My experience using the game app was awesome. Easy to control, another thing I love about the app is that the loading period when restart is very minimal...but I think there should be more type or categories of enemy so as to make it a little bit fun...But above it all, its a good game', 'Best game ever...... This is a very nice ninja game.. But you need make more features in this game to make it more fascinating.... It will also be better if u add a sword in the game.... That will also make it the boom ..👍👍👍 Keep up the good work', 'It so very beautiful warrior game and I can most enjoy with this game but last step have no fight with enemy it cheating', ""It would be better to get to know in which stage / map or where are not all letters are collected. Like i was looking for one letter in the third stage and i played the 9 maps hundred of times and didn't find it.. It was annoying. Otherwise it's a cool game!"", ""Awesome considering it's from an indie. But there is one bug I've encountered so far. The first scroll is not appearing in the level 5 of Bamboo Forest. That's why I'm reducing the starts."", 'I thought it is the second part of ninja arashi but still it was really cool. I finished it in one go but still a great attempt i hope you will add more levels and difficulties all the best for the future.', 'A complete ripoff of Ninja Arashi! That game is better in every way. Look for it. Give this game 1 star for being a fraud and flag it as being a copycat game.', 'Nice game!!!!!! Helps me a lot while boring college days...lol it helps me utilise my free time and stress reliever sort of....overall good and avoidable ads (something rare these days)']"

We’re excited to see the teams you build with these changes, Trainers. Stay tuned, as we’ll be sharing more updates like these in the future. Good luck on the battlefield!","[""This was a good game. The reason I gave it all of the 5 stars, was because they deserve it! I would kind of love to see all of the houses but like they all look like the same mansion. Also there should be an upstairs but the upstairs is for your poke'mon buddies to live in. I just think that the grass was not the best. If you can, please make this happen but you do not have to. I just think the map is a little too basic. And, with the grass, can y look u make it look like actual grass? Thanks."", ""A collector's game for Pokemon that leaves out any of the real combat of the original games, even at rudimentary levels. Fun for a bit, but the high costs of in-game resources are inhibitive, and the goals you set must be personal. Gyms are mostly pointless. Updates have fixed many app issues, and there are many events, so the community and support are strong, and that's important. If you enjoyed the collector's part of the games or cards, you will love this, but not if you wanted anything more."", ""I enjoy this game alot. Only problem with it is the battling against other players , it's kind of annoying. I feel like some players attacks build up faster than what they should. On top of that everytime I sign in its always tells me I have a weak connection for battling even though I have good service because of this I miss out on some of the battle. Still love Pokemon and always will be a big fan of it I just hope they'll fix the pvp part."", ""Playing this game is increasingly frustrating with no quality control to new features: The battle league isn't worth your time as it's a competition of who has the most stable connection; The new buddy system is just tedious; there needs to be a quality of life change for gifting. The dropoff of people playing is noticeable. I used to spend ~$15 a week on raid passes/incubators playing in a community with friends - it was a fun, cheap hobby - but is just not worth the money anymore."", 'It\'s a good time and I love the constant updates, the only problem it has is its inherent difficulty in the ""off-season"". I\'m in Canada and walking on a regular basis during winter is either too hard or impossible depending on weather conditions. I know that not giving it a 5 star for something out of the developers control is a bit off-colour but I\'m sure some incentives to play during these colder months would go a long way. Otherwise I love this game and I hope it sticks around', ""I'm conflicted. While I enjoy the game so far, with the variety of pokemon and buddy system, I absolutely do not like the battle system right now. I can understand working. on lag issues but what about that 1k difference between the leagues. Well it's a lot more than one would think. Unless you get real lucky and grind every day you aren't going to get the that next bracket easily and it puts you in there after so many plays. I have a lot more to day but I've hit the cap."", ""I love this game! Me and my dad play a lot together, and we each have a fair collection of Pokémon to say the least. It can be fun alone, or with friends (though I wish you didn't have to be 13 to access friends.) However, I feel instead of an update focused on Pokémon, we should have a graphics update. We could polish the menus, add new gui, and mabye give pokemon 4 moves. Like I said, this game is amazing, it just needs some polishing, and mabye some bug removals and lag reducing."", ""It gets people to go outdoors and have fun outdoors. There is one problem though, it doesn't work for tablets. Overall it's really fun. The updates take for ever to do. Mine has been at 100 10 full times. I am so mad at the game. I wont stop restarting the update. Overall the game is good, but updates take way more than one time to do. I have so much storage but it will not work. I was a level 12."", ""Love this game, play every day. But they could upping the amount of stardust earned. You have nearly too many ways to earn it. But hard to earn enough power up pokemon, unless you are putting in hours upon hours in a day. So if you are a casual player, don't want to progress but happy to just play when you can great otherwise requires a large time commitment."", ""Intuitive gameplay loop and it has a lot of replay value for fans of the Pokémon series. Pokémon players can enjoy the novelty of owning these iconic characters on a mobile device, and this is a great game for newcomers. There are some flaws but not enough to be noticeable - there were some glitches with Pokestops but it didn't affect gameplay. I would highly recommend this game to anyone with a high data plan."", ""I first downloaded Pokémon Go in 2016 & deleted it in 2017, downloaded it again in 2019 & am considering deleting it again. Honestly, the game has improved a lot since I first downloaded it, my main issue is that it's hard to obtain Evolution items. I play with around 8 people & I have items that I don't need that other people would love to have. I wish there was a way to trade items or transfer items rather than delete them since they're rare. Overall, it is a nice game but needs improvement."", ""I love this game because it takes me back to when I was younger, it promotes exercise and catching them all. I'd love to have the chance to sell the items I dont use to get coins to purchase incubators or even more storage. For example i get 20 pokeballs each week from walking but I dont get many pokemon around my area. Now I have 230 pokeballs and nothing to throw them at. So currently I'm just throwing them away and it seems like a waste!"", ""Been playing for 3 days now, really gives me a reason to move around more. Only issue is the trainer battles. I felt like they should've given you some pointers on the first battle on the mechanics and not tell you how to actually battle. I've played a fair share of the games, and it's sad to say that the battle system in the game feels wonky."", ""The game overall is a really great way to waste time, and help fitness by getting people to walk. It doesn't get the 5th star because it requires active phone data in order to play, which I can't afford. Also, the latest update cannot be downloaded on my phone. I'm on wifi and have plenty of storage space. I have an LG phone, and I'm not sure if it has to do with the phone or with the app."", 'It\'s entertaining enough and it gets you to go out and walk around, but if you\'re a big fan of the games you might be disappointed. Battling is so unbalanced it hurts. Type effectiveness going out the window if your ""Charge Move"" charges faster being an example. If you like traditional pokemon battling this game probably isn\'t for you.', ""I love Pokemon Go, I play it almost everyday, but there are some things about it that are frustrating. Everytime I battle, it always has a weak connection even if I'm sitting right next to the other person I am battling. It makes the battle unfair because I can attack or use and shield and it doesn't do anything, but the other trainer can attack and beat my Pokemon."", ""Online battle is a frustrating mess. The Dragon Breath move breaks the game for the user of the move, causing frame drops and client side bugs. This has happened to me personally and thousands of others. When there is a weak internet connection for one trainer; the battle freezes for them, and goes on as normal for the other. Why the game doesn't just pause for both players until internet's restablished beyond me. Yet again the developers handicap users outside of cities. Embarrassing."", 'Great game.A mobile game that actually feels like a game.Remember it is free to play so there are microtransactions, but it is done well enough that you arent really pressured into spending money. I would recommend finding a way that is best for you to keep getting 50 coins a day until you reach a point where you feel you have enough item and pokemon storage. Some problems with the game is that the game is dull once you reach the ""end game"". Also they really need a shiny and a lucky friend event', 'The latest update just constantly says ""weak connection"" every time I try to battle, no matter where I am, what device I\'m on or what internet provider I\'m using! 😡😡 Its so frustrating spending 2+ years worth of time and money on this game and now I\'ve missed out on so much since the few updates have constantly kept me from being able to play.', ""An ok game that I play with my son. It gives me an excuse to be more active and walk a bit further than I normally would. I'd like to see an option where you could battle 'random' other trainers rather than just attempting to get friends EDIT The game has started to do this, thank you, but wonder if trades could be posted on a message board, the stardust cost could be higher for randoms rather than friends"", ""I don't understand why can't you add pokestops and gyms for rural players you just have to add them in game not in the real world. You just want to earn revenue without improving your game and it has been almost 4 years since the game is out and you could not add gyms and stops. You are just a biased company who knows that in rural area there are not many players so we won't generate a good revenue from them and we will just add more gyms and stops in the area which is already having stops."", 'VERY UPSET & FRUSTRATED!!!!! why is it that EVERY time that I battle against other people, it keeps freezing up, and the other person gets to attack me? when I press my charged attack button it doesn\'t do anything but other person gets to attack me and all of my pokemon die! This is NOT fair and it happens to my husband & friends too! Also keeps saying "" weak connection"" when the internet where we are at is fine!! I hope you can somehow fix this problem!!!!', ""Fantastic game and i have only 1 complaint. it started to crash when i go into AR mode to take pictures of my pokemon. Didn't start doing it until the most resent update. Please fix, thank you😊 (not an issue but maybe make berries purchasable in the shop for pokecoins. So people, including me, who don't have many pokestops or gyms near, can still get berries☺)"", 'Very nice and interesting concept. I liked the game very much. Good graphics. Sometimes it says ""gps signal not found"" other than this no other complaint. I downloaded the game on 28/01/2020. And now i\'m in level 23. I love rayquaza, will it make a comeback in 2020 ?? Please update me soon.', ""Definitely a great game to play if u have access to mobile data and can go for walks. Even though I do not have data and can only play at home, this game is still one of my favourite games to date ever since I started playing in 2019. You can still use apps like apple health or google fit if u don't have data and want to walk your buddy/eggs. And with the newly added mystery hour, it will keep u wanting to play more!"", ""I really wish they would have just waited to develop the game fully instead of serving us half a game in hopes we would look past all the disgusting issues. If I could rate 0 stars I would. The rank system in this game is a joke, it lags like crazy, the location fails half the time and it's just overall not what I expected and a huge dissapointment. So much potential wastes here."", 'A game you dont have to feel bad about playing. I dont end up staying awake all night drinking energy drinks and being a recluse in my home. I get to go outside and into world! Very fun! Also, as a mom to a toddler it works out great! There are pokestops or gyms everywhere I take my child! The library, parks, the pool, indoor parks, the mall.. she gets to play while I play too!', 'Great game, a little repetitive with the ""candy"" leveling and evolution. Its a fun and great game, esp with the new buddy system. I love my Mew following me around. I wish the game would implement breeding and allow you to delete eggs however. Great game over all tho, esp if you live in a major city and commute to work or school via bus, train, etc. Also, the Gotcha Watch at gamestop or amazon is a great help for drivers with auto catch/spin stops. Check it out!!', 'Good game but i am only rating it 2 stars for the time being as i think you should get daily free pokemon balls. I would say atleast 10 or 5 free daily pokemon balls. And in my opinion you should get daily rewards when you login each day. Such as pokemon balls. Food. Potion to heal pokemon. Points to level up etc. Still alot of improving to be made in this game!! I wont be spending anymore money on this game until theses improvements are made!!', 'This game is amazing! I have been a Pokemon (pocket monster) fan since the beginning! Maybe introduce the EXP. Share as a gift to everyone who completes a special mission. Make it a little easier to collect candy. It should only work if you have a buddy with you and the other Pokemon gain candy as well. Maybe make the EXP. Share a week long timed item because not everyone walks as much as others. Can only use one a week. Just an idea. Thank you for this game!', 'I honestly have played it almost everyday for years. Every game has it\'s points of frustration. It is a perpetually updating game so technical issues happen. They do try to adjust the game to what the players want. Lots of events to help you fill out your pokedex and plenty of free items if you go out and play the game and visit ""Stops/Gyms"". I\'ve never spent a penny on the game but know plenty of friends that have. All in all, an excellent game.', 'Instead of adding new things to the game, fix the problems that exist. My wife cannot log in because of the ""unable to authenticate"" issue that so many other people logging in with Pokemon Trainer Club are having. People leave this game because of it and now we are leaving it too. All it does is cause frustration and i urge you to resolve this problem. If this continues, the game will just become a memory. It will not live much longer if this keeps happening. Problem solve people!', ""I enjoy playing the game but when I went to check on one of my pokemon so I could evolve it, all the pokemon candies were gone. I had around 100 and now it says I have 10. I worked hard to get all those candies so I'm kind of mad. Went to help and support and it didn't help me there either. If it gets fixed I'd gladly change the rating."", ""It's a pretty decent/addictive game. I just wish you could play it offline. I don't have phone data and I can't go hunting wherever there's no public WiFi. So I'm pretty much useless unless I'm at home or a public building. I understand needing it to send gifts and trade and such but everything else should be offline playable"", ""This game overal is really fun. I love to play this game while I'm on my way home, theres always some pokemon to catch XD. My only issue with this game is that the pokeballs are hard to get after you use them all. I dont enjoy or even really spend money on a game so that makes playing that game not as enjoyable. The pokecoins cost money that im not willing to spend and I want to be able to catch pokemon. To the creator of the game if you are reading this please make it easy to get pokecoins/item"", ""This grew on me. My first impression of this game was not positive coming from arcade game culture. All gameplay of pogo cosists of simply swiping/taping repeatedly, and it uses aggressive paytoprogress monetization. Balancing is horrible and maybe 20 pokemon total are viable at all. What saves the game is that it is a hybrid exercise guide app and pokemon. I'd never even imagined myself walking 120+ miles a month before pogo, but it's not as bad as it sounds because the game eases me to do it."", ""This can be a beneficial tool, but it depends on how much you're willing to play with other people, which is an unfortunate to this game (being forced to play with other people to complete certain goals etc). The game also gives preferential treatment to newer accounts, so consider yourself lucky you started now instead of 2016 like I did. Other than that, when you run out of pokeballs it becomes painfully obvious they want money out of you since friend gifts and pokestops will yield nothing."", ""Things this app desperately needs: - chat. We need a way to talk between friends and share things. - click to claim rewards. It makes no sense that you can do this with field research and special research and yet not with friends when they hit a certain level of friendship with you. That would solve the need to coordinate with ppl you don't know or can't get in touch with to pop lucky eggs. - reduced animations on EVERYTHING. Going through the menus and entering raids and gyms take too long. Etc"", 'After 4 years I redownload the game and so far I am really liking all the new updates and am getting back into the game pretty good and going hard. HOWEVER!!! I would give it the last 2 stars BUT when I incubate/hatch my eggs I get the same pokemon 4 times in a row even when the eggs are diffrent from 2km, 5km, 7km & even the 10km and that is pretty annoying. Please fix that & then I would LOVE to give this 5 stars for me:).', 'If you have access to a city then hitting pokèstops and catching pokèmon can be a lot of fun. Unfortunately for anyone in the country, there is almost nothing to do. The trainer battles would be fun, except you will only be allowed to face trainers at your power level at the beginning of the season. When making suggestions to improve the game: customer support is often rude and dismissive. Ria S in particular made it very clear that player input is worthless and they have no intent to listen.']"

Great graphics. Game has one major flaw though. You get 5 lives to complete each level. No more and no less. You can gain more sometimes in levels but its a one time deal. It does not increase your total from then on. As such, if you use all your lives you have to start all the way at the beginning. Even if your last life was al the way at the end. With each new level comes a harder challenge but no new lives. If we are collecting diamonds, used to unlock balls, we should be able to use them to more lives and at the last save point.

Eggman should be added as a rare character. Maybe with missile, mine, and illusion boost attacks. 2. This is a pvp game, could there be some way to be in some sort of group team? 3.

The graphics are great, the controls are easy, and overall it's really fun.

I even made a purchase in the app because I deemed it worth it.', 'Four stars because the characters in the main menu are just screenshots while they could be showing off some cool moves. I also think that more characters could be available - right now half of the chars are the same, just with different outfit. I also miss a mechanic through which I could farm red stars. They are essential for opening chests. And only 4 chests pending at a time means you kinda need red stars like crazy. Makes sense, forces you to pay, but kinda turns it into pay-to-win...', ""I really enjoy this game a lot, but one huge problem I have with it is when for whatever reason your internet connectivity is acting up while your racing or if you begin a race...no matter what you get totally screwed outta your trophies when you weren't even able to run the race! I have excellent internet so I don't believe it's fair to take your hard earned trophies when the game decides to boot you out. Also sometimes the controls when your moving left don't always work."", 'pretty fun Graphics are great as well what would be really cool though is if it had a story mode on the side and much more Sonic characters in the Sonic franchise', ""I have a problem with the favorite thing. For some reason it just randomly chooses which favorite if it wasn't my favorite. Like say Amy. Amy instantly got on my favorite list even though she is not my favorite. So I would like it if there was an option to choose the favorite. Maybe add a star or heart or Sonic logo and press it it would add to the favorite list. I would appreciate it. So I still give a 5 but please remove the random fav please. So 5 🌟cuz I love the game.. 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟= rad!!"", ""It's a really good game but I wish it had more characters but the graphics are a 5 stars and controls 4.9 stars and the whole game 1 trilon stars"", ""every race i do it shows an ad, it's so freaking bad but the game isn't bad to be honest is kinda nostalgic, so much feelings coming back from my dreamcast"", ""Competitive races against 3 other players. Matches only last about a minute or so, and you're usually matched with players with similar skills. Prizes are awarded based off of performance and participation with a daily limit. Some of these prizes are time locked. Unlock many Sonic characters and costumed variants. As always with free to play games, ads are present."", 'As a huge Sonic fan I enjoyed the game from the beginning but as you progress you realize that they scam you. If you get first place they give you less points and the one who got second gets more than you. It also happens vise versa and on some occasions you lose points if you get in second and the one who got last gets more points!!!', 'Works, but recently stays on loading screen, then kicks me out of the game once starting up.', ""Good concept executed very poorly. I personally like this game it's more interactive and fun than the actual game it's based on but the biggest problem for it is that there are an unnecessary amount of ads that you can't avoid. There isn't even a remove ads option that you would normally buy. This would be much better if there were ads after every 3 games or so not every game you play, The gameplay is too short to have ads after every match. It's a good game but Sonic forces too many ads on us."", ""Everything is great except for probably the sensitivity of each directional flick. Maybe it's just me, but sometimes the game is very fast-paced and I have to flick to different directions fast and it will sometimes make me flick up when I meant to flick right or left. Another thing is the app doesn't seem to have friendly local play where you can invite a friend to play against. It should really have that if it doesn't and the game will be almost perfect!""]"

I love how its your own personal dramatic mysterious story;making you feel like harry potter yourself except your own unique story. Well worth the download and play time. The only downside is how much energy it takes to do everything and how much it costs to get more.', ""This game is over all pretty amazing! Only things I would want to change is how much money it cost to buy everything that you want. My biggest complaint about it is the energy... IT TAKES SO LONG TO REFILL... And I'm not going to waste $10 on the gems just to buy more energy if the energy only lasts one day. There is no adds which is a plus! I might recommend this app."", ""I love the game! It really helped me understand more about Harry Potter, but a few things it needs to improve on... First is the energy. It drains too fast and takes about 6-7 hours to refill completely for me. There are however places on the map that allow you to get more energy. I also don't like how you have to be in a certain year to be in certain events... Thanks and I hope these improve."", ""The game itself is fun enough but I really think the pay-for-play model is horrible. It either discriminates gameplay in favor for those who have the money or worse, who don't really but spend it anyways. I would much rather pay upfront or on a monthly subscription basis and then the competition can just be about the type of games or skills. It is impossible to win for your house unless you spend significant money."", ""I gave 5 stars when I started out but I'm revising my review! I'm still really enjoying the characters and dialogue, but the pace of the game has slowed down to a crawl and some quests seem impossible to complete if you don't have a full energy gauge when you start them. I wish something could be done instead of paying the fees (which are very high and can easily add up to hundreds of dollars if you want to do more than a few quests every day). I'd rather just buy the game outright!"", 'I love the game but I think there should be a ""end event early"" because sometimes you might not have enough time to finish or you want to do something else but It won\'t let you because you\'re still i that event so the option to end early would be awesome. Also I would like the ability to befriend the slytherin girl Merula Snyde I think it could add an interesting dynamic to the game if done right. This may be a thing and I just don\'t know about it but my opinion stands.', 'I like the story and the graphics; however the system has serious save malfunctions. I have often restarted the same mission/class after having it half complete because when I leave the app to let my energy refill, all progress is lost when I return!! There is also a regular glitch of ""finding"" energy, but then it never being given to you.', ""It is a great game but there isn't a way to restart your progress. I need to restart it because my sister logged in on my Facebook account, and now I cannot get my old data back and I am forced to use her character. I dont want to use her character. So I am uninstalling this game. I will reinstall it once I can reset my progress so I don't have to use my sister's character."", ""Could be done better. The energy goes way to fast and doesn't regen in near enough time to keep most people interested for more than a couple months i bet. Storywise its the same problem Fallout 4 has with telling you youre choosing your own story but thats only within the confines of a story about a brother and vaults I couldnt care less about. The saving grace of this game is solely that its Harry Potter and even then the teachers are written poorly and almost a parody of the originals."", ""Unfortunately I have to revise my review, do not buy anything! All the fancy beds and clothes and stuff might look nice but the graphic doesn't download properly and it messes up the game. Also, the energy renewing thing isn't working properly, so don't get your hopes up to finish any of the timed events."", 'Why do we have to do these potions repetitive each time wastes energy and isnt really fair Makes the game slower. Each time l complete a level l have to go back and do ALL of the lessons again to get anywhere. Change the energy level to be realistic. Like the game but not for the repeating of the same lessons from year one to year two !!!', 'It\'s a fun game. Sucks you go through you energy so quickly. The one issue I\'m having lots of trouble with is trying to adopt Niffler. In the Grasslands with Hagrid, I can go through all the steps feed and bond, but every time I try to collect the rewards and move on, the ""collect"" button doesn\'t work. I\'ve tried to uninstall and reinstall the game but same issue. I\'m gonna try on a different device and see if that works.', ""Really fun, with a great story line. Update: I suddenly couldn't get the app to work for quite some time. After the last update, it started working again, but I can't even really enjoy doing special tasks! I have a life. I can't get on my phone to play a game every time my energy fills up. I NEVER get to finish tasks. It is maddening! I just had a second go at the task with Lupin (I haven't gotten to meet him in it, but it's obviously him.) and, again, didn't get to finish. Ugh!"", ""The character interaction and story elements are quite good. The parts where you have to wait for energy to recharge so you can click the same characters and read the same snippets repeatedly are quite tedious. I wish there were more bits where you chose what to say and far fewer bits where you click and read things that you can't choose. Also, it is REALLY FRUSTRATING that you can't choose when to start a timed event. I have failed them multiple times because they start during the work week."", 'Just dowgraded to 1 star as it appears dueling is now rigged. Just lost 16 out of 18 duels. Almost never tie, computer picks the correct counter almost every time. Please make this more fair and maybe add some lifelines to dueling. This is a high maintenance game that requires you to expend energy and wait until more energy is generated. There are a few mini games but they are repetitive. Would like to see different rewards based on quidditch performance. Most fun is the Fullmarks challenge.', ""I love it the only part I don't like is that you use your energy really fast and you have to buy more 😓 but besides that the game is awesome 😍 edit: I recently started a new game and I had got to my quidditch chapters and I was almost at two stars for a 'one star to pass' and then I go back into my game and it says I didn't even get one star and so now I have to redo the eight hour star and that really pissed me of, anyway the game is still really good but it keeps doing things like that to me"", ""I've spent ALOT of time playing this game, and it's really great I really want to continuously play it but I cant because for a lot of tasks you have to wait and you also have to wait for enrgy refill, apart from that it's so good! At the start of the game I thought it would just be the same thing all the way through, just going to classes and doing the same class minigames but I was completely wrong. There are loads of side missions and limited time events that change the experience!"", ""I reeeally really want to like this game. It could be so great! But 4 minutes for ONE energy?? At the rate you're forced to use them, it's just ridiculous. Unless of course you lay down hard cash for gems. Please PLEASE just change that one thing 🙏🏻 I will still try to play, but know I'll eventually get bored of waiting if they keep it how it is 😔"", 'The game itself is fun, but you can only play it for 5 minutes about 3 times per day. Such a waste. I find myself wishing there were a full version I could buy and play through. And buying more energy is a crock. 20 dollars a day would only give you another ten minutes of play per day.', ""I love Harry Potter but I found this game rather disappointing. You have to wait four minutes to get back one energy rating and multiple are needed for the tasks. Unless you are willing to pay for upgrades it can become very tedious waiting for energy reserves to replenish. It's more of a slow-burner game. It also takes ages to load. Although I like the concept and the graphics it's just too slow-paced for me to want to continue with, which is a pity."", 'First I was like "" love it "" then like "" I hate it "" then now I feel like it is a good app but it is a long time seriously I would recommend from 4 minutes to 2 minutes or something . Then it really crashes I would sometimes leave it then the screen offs to save battery then you have to start playing that task again .So if you fix it I will give it 5 stars. Well thank you for making this gameplay.', 'I just started the game and you immediately lose 9 energy right at the start just picking up books. I heard the energy situation was bad with this game but I never knew it was this bad. Probably not going to be playing much longer. The best thing for this company and others like it to do is to just remove the energy feature entirely, seriously even the top positive review for this game complains about the energy running out too quick. If you need revenue, use ads or make a game worth paying for.', ""Ok to good experience. Problems are - keep crashing constantly, and can't play on a tablet, computer or laptop which is a downer. Would love to see this in a free range video game on platforms of ps3, PS4, ps5 and Xbox. I'm sure it will be a hit. Just need more in universe experience and freedom in the environment like GTA. Harry Potter fans have been longing for it for years now."", 'having an issue with quest "" feed two food to any creature "". I can complete it , but when I try to collect the awards it freezes and sometimes it lags , but other than that I have to problems with it . the game overall is wonderful and interesting . **EDIT : they fixed the issue with the quest . 4 star to 5 star . now I\'ll be able to progress with the magical creatures', ""I absolutely love this game. It's really fun to play. The one flaw that causes me to rate this four stars however, is the length of time it takes to get energy. I would have to do a certain task all over again because I had to wait an extremely long time for a point of energy (4 minutes) and maybe halving the time would be great. This may be the most common complaint, but it's something that really makes the overall game experience a bit worse."", 'Would be a great game if energy levels increased as you go up level & it didn\'t take 5 minutes to get just ONE energy. The energy you ""find"" around the castle isn\'t enough to do anything either, not to mention you need books to get a fairy, that when I first started only cost 10 book but now is 30?!? Books for creatures are nearly impossible to come by & considering it\'s already a task to help Hagrid that\'s also bad. Unless you are going to pay your way through, don\'t bother...', ""I love everything about this game except the time energy needs to be refill fully.. I think it should be only 2 minutes per energy. I don't mind about the tap games as i am a busy person so this helps me to play only for a while then get back to my business that i need to attend. The energy os only the problem for me but as for the gameplay and the story, everything is perfection! Great job!"", 'Absolutely love this game. I love everything about it, the graphics, the story mode, the dialogue. But it looses a star just because of the energy system. To fix that problem either reduce the timer of regaining energy or at least make the actions cost less energy. Other than that, great game and keep up the good work', ""Like a few others have mentioned, the amount of energy you're given versus the amount of energy you use makes it difficult to play this game except in short spurts. That wouldn't bother me much, except the game glitches ALL THE TIME. There's all these pop ups every time you try to move to a different area and it crashes the game. I spend about as much time signing back into the game as I do playing it."", ""Very neat little Harry Potter game. I'm almost finished year two and haven't gotten bored yet. I would give it 5 stars and enjoy it even more if there was a few more ways to get a little more energy. Maybe make some clothes and animals cost a little bit less as well because there aren't too many ways to earn books and not everyone can afford to pay for diamonds etc. I think that is about it."", 'I had really enjoyed this game despite everything taking so long to load but had to uninstall it after having phone problems last year and now it seems to have totally deleted my account and how far I had gotten. So annoying as it took so long to get to the point i was at in the game.', ""I do indeed love this game but unfortunately I have reached the final chapter of year six and am waiting for more levels to become available. I can still level up my creatures and do duels but there's nothing else to do and it would be really awesome to be able to go back to the other years and complete lessons that were missed at this time to fill the void."", 'The game is fun but when you run out of those energy booster things, you have to wait for 1 or 2 hours for them to restore again. I am in 3rd year and of you are in some class, you have to wait and then the class is over and you sid not complete it. We could have a large number of lives at my opinion. All in all the game is really fun.', ""I've been an HP fan since the books, so this started as a fine enough game. But timed special events are specifically created to take advantage of fans. Quests will be the 8 hour mark for the most inane tasks, and I feel like I hardly ever finish them because I have things like a job and a sleep schedule. So unless I'm glued to my phone the moment my energy is refilled, I don't finish a timed quest. It's designed just to take your money, with no actual regard for the fans that play. Shame."", 'This could be a very fun game, but the wait time is too much. Unless you want to play 5 minutes a day and keep along side checking your email.. after 5 min of play your out of energy and have to wait up to 8 hrs for next task.. have not deleted just yet had the game about 4 days now. Not sure its worth the memory usage on my ph.. my issues are not knew, so obviously game makers are willing to loose more players - again it could be a really great game, not worth the download.', 'This game is so much fun already! You can create your avatar, make friends,make enemies, and interact with people by choosing from three kinds of answers. You can collect coins and gems as well as earn knowledge points, independence points, etc. The Hogwarts Express is ready to take you on an awesome ride! P.S. this is my real opinion 👍🏻\U0001f9d9🏻\u200d♂️', 'Don\'t waste your resources on ""special events"" if you dont plan on spending real money to help. Not enough time to wait for your energy to recycle and finish the event. Regular game play is fun though. Great way to sit back and have a mini adventure. Update: (2 stars to 4) new update brought some much needed help and relief for much longer game play! Thank you keep it up.', ""Edit: I had to drop another star because the crashes are more frequent than ever. I have consistenly go on hiatus for this game and then come back later on. The feel has definitely changed from before the events, particularly in the form of time-limited quests. I'm fine with the energy thing, even though that suits the old FB games more. But really, I would love to enjoy the game more during the times I decide to play again if it wasn't so crash-prone, especially with the time-limited quests."", ""I can't tell if it's fun or not. Haven't been able to play it enough with how much waiting there is to regain energy. Wait time needs to be cut down because I'm absolutely not going to pay real money for a game like this. The game itself is a basic concept that has been around years but they made this Harry Potter version hoping to get money. That's tacky."", 'Really fun game, but they keep making ""limited edition quests"" throughout the different years which makes it impossible to complete all of the achievements. I\'m fourth year and all my achievements were full through the years, now in my previous years I suddenly haven\'t learned about 13 spells and a few special things. Books are also VERY difficult to come buy and make getting new creatures a nightmare, they\'re idiculously overpriced in the shop aswell. Definitely losing my interest in this game.']"

You get to create your own Mansion and surrounding areas...helping you with more coins to continue playing scenes, so you can advance further in the game. There is always something you need or want to put on your Mansion's grounds. It makes for a very interesting game. There is also another hidden gem in this game (An Other Complete Game!). And you can tap into it by touching the Air Plane. This is another Great Hidden Objects Game! Two games in 1!"", ""It was really fun at first. Although I had to wait for the next level sometimes, I could still move along relatively quickly. Now I'm at a point where all I get from the special briefcases are coins and energy.. I very rarely get any compasses and I don't get any materials anymore. Even the boxes are becoming more and more coins.. If I don't get any compasses I can't expand, then I don't have any place to build. No materials so no renovating. Gets boring when I know I'll always get coins, too."", ""Game was fun and cruised along for the first Chapter. Unfortunately, I'm at a stand still and it's been 3 days. I can't play unless I earn flowers, but I have no coins to buy decor to earn flowers. I can't earns coins unless I play. See the cycle? Also, I refuse to use real cash to buy items just to play these types of games. I don't mind waiting an alloted time to continue, but that's not how this games works."", 'I enjoy it for having a great mystery to solve, keeping my mind organized by search and find in gorgeous and detailed pictures, and having fun decorating too. I do wish there was a better way to escape the game without it always taking your ""energy"". Sometimes while playing you get interrupted or have to close the game to be involved in real life. : )', 'Like this game! But I just went & spent diamonds to get decorations & now all of a sudden I\'m finding a ton of hammers, boards, pipes, etc. I don\'t even have a ""button"" for those types of buildings anymore, so I don\'t get why I\'m getting that kind of stuff! It\'s especially a HUGE waste when I open the star boxes & that\'s all I\'m getting now! Either come out with more buildings or get rid of those type of rewards!', 'Love this app! The graphics are great and the idea of solving a mystery while searching for hidden objects and gathering clues is intriguing. It is a wonderful way to relax, while having fun. There are so many wonderful elements...creating and designing a beautiful island...visiting other players islands...giving and receiving gifts...earning bonuaes....love it! If I had any criticism...it would be minor and it would have to do with the words being illegible on light backgrounds 😊.', ""At 1st the game cruises right along. But I've gotten to a point where there's nothing new to buy in the decor. Opening areas is so difficult now. You have find 20+ compasses, but you can only win maybe 4 per level. So it's taking FOREVER! Same with fixing the light house. Can only do 1 thing a day. You rarely find diamonds. I don't like how they can control how long you play, unless you want to make pricey purchases. I look at other islands & see all kinds of diff decor that is not on mine???"", ""I love it! It's fun finding the objects & helps hand-eye coordination for me. I try to find items faster than each time before. Then the castle & grounds I get to decorate is alot of fun. I didn't expect that at all. Also the conversations between June and the others is alot of fun as well. Only been playing a short while but I give it two thumbs up from me and my young kids!"", ""I play this game just before bed every night, so the energy restrictions and orchid collection aren't too bad. Sometimes the objects are IMPOSSIBLE to find without a hint, which lowers your point score. but overall I've enjoyed it so far. Expansions are expensive so I haven't bought any, if you're playing casually like me it's awesome but if you were wanting to play regularly probably not so much. The ads seem to advertise games that are NOT what you think they'll be - beware!"", ""Like watching paint dry! This has got to be the slowest progressing game I've ever played!!! BORING!!!!! If you aren't willing to pay for this game, then expect to wait and wait and wait and wait. The game forces you to decorate in to proceed to the next level of the mystery/search, but if you can't cover the cost of decorating, you are stuck. Definitely not fun!"", 'The problem that people are having with downloading the game is the internet connection. I had the same problem. What I found that works, is load the game using your data instead of using WiFi. It drags or it will not load with WiFi. I play the game using data, it works wonderfully. The game loads fast and I play all day long. It is a great game 👍. It us know if it works for you.', ""This has been a very entertaining game for the week I've had it. Only downside is that i am out of room to decorate on my board and I've mastered all the levels that aren't locked. I'm not earning enough compasses to unlock new areas, eventhough I have plenty of stars and I cannot earn enough flowers to reach the next level to search for more objects. All of my renovations are complete, except 2 that are pending for the next 17 hours. If there's any way to fix these things, that would be exce"", 'Clever pictures for the detective feel and it has funny housing options, even if it is a little too feminine looking for my design taste. Cant play for very long however, before it turns into the typical free-to-play-or-pay-lots-to-progress decently fast. It is however not as bad as most, but it is expensive. I do enjoy it a lot though.', ""Very entertaining and good to keep the mind active! Just don't like when you can't go on because of the non-hidden object scenes take up your decorating flowers to enter a new chapter and how hard it is to get the compasses. But that is part of the game I need to be aware of! I like how the murder mystery has developed and continued so far!"", ""I enjoy playing hidden object games. It is impossible to only play games without characters and dialogue but these characters don't interfere often and can be dispatched quickly.The scenes are lovely. My eyes have trouble discerning some of the objects if hidden in a similar color or not the color one thinks upon seeing the word. For example, the word 'barrel' tells me look for a natural wood color. But it is green in the scene. Fun to pass some time, see how far I can get without a purchase."", ""2/3/2020 current game is frozen on level 177. I've been really enjoying this game. I looked for an update to see if it will fix. When I click on next scene, it tells me I cannot connect to YOUR SERVER. Help please. Thank you. I took a screenshot.

I hope no because I like the game."", ""It's working again, now I can give the game the rating it deserves! It's a lovely game, the graphics are great and the story keeps you involved. You can play without spending real life money even though the developer would clearly like you to. It'd be nice to be able to dismiss the Connect To Facebook option permanently though - not everyone has or wants a Fb account!"", 'I still love this game, but like another reviewer said, as you move up to the higher levels, you run into a couple of related problems. First. The requirements to open new territory get increasingly higher, which means the design elements of the game become less and less possible. You end up stacking design elements in all available space. Second. Opportunities to acquire the compass elements become less frequent, so the first problem becomes more prevalent. :(', ""Great game, you don't have to spend real money which is good, so far I've found it progresses just fine, especially as the gem things don't seem to be as hard to come by as they sometimes can be in these games. I agree with a couple of other reviews that have said it'd be cool if you could rotate items as they sometimes don't make sense the way they are."", 'I love the game. Best hidden object game out there! But the ads are ridiculous. Even after you view the ad in order to speed up the ""help wanted"" section and to use 10 energy, rather than 15....I have watched 4 ads in a row, in its entirety, and still did not get the required bonus. Not sure how ""they"" get paid...could be a glitch, could be on purpose....I do not know. This is the ONLY issue that makes playing this game one unenjoyable!!!', ""This is a fun game I ran in to a snag but it fixed it self or the hard developers fix it. I love this game. I just wish I could get more energy. I would like to see more free diamonds given out. I can't buy a lot of the things you can get more of. I'm on a fixed income and things cost a lot to get more. maybe lower the price of these would help out a lot of people. It hard to get the quests done if you can't get more energy too. Not enough time to get it done. For me."", ""Out of all the hidden object games I like this one the most. Its challenging, you don't have to spend money If you dont want to. It does not hound you to add your friends from social media. It gives you and an option to be creative by designing your own town to earn points for the game. It does have the option to socialize with other players. I have a lot of fun playing this game."", ""Beautifully drawn graphics, styling to such detail - that's the main reason I downloaded and keep coming back. My main idea is to keep the brain working spotting every little new detail. However, the plot is quite captivating too, and the on-going development of your own estate is exciting - and the best part, after a great design of each element, for me is that you can move and re-arrange each detail anytime you like, trying different layout, especially when you get an expansion permission.."", ""Good hidden action game with achievable targets which entice you to play more. Pity it's too much for my tablet to handle. It kept crashing back to the home screen the further into the game I progressed or if I viewed some of the ads. I got frustrated ultimately, I couldn't type in the Cafe very easily either, the keyboard kept closing so I've uninstalled it. If I get a better tablet I may play again in the future."", 'Fun, creative game, but its very limited in point earning, land expansion and design unless you pay. Points for search-puzzles seems to be totally random and to ""level up"" takes FOREVER, a ""perfect "" solved puzzle will yield 60 points, and then 17, and then 9... it just gets frustrating and boring. The scenes are neat and change so thats cool, but trying to upgrade things just takes WAY too long. Earning materials/compasses for expansions takes WAY too much time, and areas unlocked are SO small.', ""Good, not excellent but good, Gameplay is okay, Exciting story, Exercises your vocabulary, Making your eyes sharp attentive, however please make the energy regenerate faster or make the bar longer because from 110 energy you can just play for a small amount of time then you'll have to wait again for 110 minutes to play again. And also the amout of time to wait and costly coins if you bought a thing to decorate to unlock other chapters. it's hard to earn coins. but nyway all in all game good.

It was well thought out and had a good storyline. The items that were hidden were not always easily found. Definately some challenges in this game. I really enjoyed it. The graphics were exceptional.

What's next?"", 'June\'s Journey is absolutely, in my humble opinion the most interesting, hidden objects game! I love the graphics, and the story line keeps me intrigued. I look forward to each new chapter! And though there may be a few glitches, they are nothing in compassion to the pleasure I get from playing this game. I have to also point out the ""Wooga team"" are very professional in their approach to their players requests for help in the game. I\'m so impressed! ... they are courteous and helpful.', ""I love this game, and understand that you have to jump through a few hoops to gain your land. For those who hate having it all cluttered up, click on whatever you'd like to remove, and send it to storage! Suggestion to developers; Please take the Upgrade tab away and instead give us the option of a folder of what's available to upgrade? I'm never going to upgrade my stables and hate that sign blocking them! And please indicate which buildings are permanent? I'm now stuck with 1 I don't love."", 'Great game! I have some suggestions: For the cargo ship storage feature, allow whatever we store to also count for flower credit. And for the gifts we give friends (the bushes) allow us to move them wherever we want to put them in case we want to keep them.

This morning when I opened it I was forced to update to the latest version to move forward. It wouldn't let me by pass it and play anyway.

I'm not starting over at level one!"", 'I really enjoyed this game. The hidden object search is challenging. The script is humourous and the graphics are beautiful. After many hours of free play the game would not continue to play without updating. Update downloaded but would not install. I tried many times and many things. Then I tried uninstalling and reinstalling. That worked but I lost my progress in the game. Quite a few enthusiastic players seem to have disappeared recently. Perhaps this is a common problem?', ""This is the most fun I have had in a game experience hands down! Developing your own gardens and arranging buildings to create a magical island all your own.

HATE the adds especially the Casino adds (which do not have the REPORT ADD function... that dodgy for sure when you consider Google's policy). The controls and interface objects that cover the clues/items is very poor programming and add frustration to the game. Also if you open a Star box and do not reveal you lose it. Other glitches where items aren't awarded really gives me the s@#$s. Why so many adds for paying customers.. Other developers remove the adds, why not you guys?"", ""I enjoy the story line, seek & find, sharing gifts with fellow players & that I can steadily progress & earn at a pace that isn't the painstaking waiting game that I've experienced in other games (wherein the developers gently force you to spend).

June's sleuths join or create groups, meet up for coffee(energy points), chats, playing in group challenges for prizes. Fun!"", ""Relaxing, fun and interesting who-dunnit story line. Update: since the Oct 24 update and i got the Bell Tower (twice) now I seem to be stuck. No room to build, very very few compasses and the projects that bring leveling up potential all take at least two days to complete. Im hopelessly stuck. UPDATE 2/13/2020 Thank you for the HUGE surprise for playing 1 year....200 Diamonds! Yes DIAMONDS. Also the new mini game lounge is nice. I won 4 Compasses for our team coming in EIGHTH place! June's #1"", ""Great game to play occasionally, interesting and great graphics, but not a game that u can play for long periods of time. My big issue is game refusing to load all the way after I've completed one hundred plus levels.

Nothing wrong with the device, never had this problem with any other app."", ""This excellent game is very well designed, the gameplay test your memory retention as scenes expand for hiden objects, there's an actual story line that includes the game chacters, but the beautiful scenes with high details is the heart of the game, scenes from foreign countries use different names for some objects in the US which I love, it invites thinking, you will have a hard time putting it down!""]"

Overall it's aesthetic is relaxing and beautiful."", ""It was mostly enjoyable. I reached the end of the second world, however, and I couldn't do the next puzzle without watching an ad.

Other than that, this is a challenging, yet fun puzzle game!"", 'Such a good style, really wanted to like it. But the ADS. ADS freaking EVERYWHERE. Puzzles take 2-10 seconds each to complete and you\'re hit by an ad wall every second or third.

This one's a gem !"", ""Could you guys change the ads to something more peaceful? I love this game I'm normally a zombies, COD, type gamer but this game makes me Zen out.

Can you tell me for sure that if I buy the game I can binge play it and not have to use coins?"", 'Not as hard as these puzzles usually are for me. Only a few have been hard. Cool story line.

Its not game clitches. Its purposeful attempts to get people to spend money. When you complete a quest and it doesn't give you the quest item.

I don't think you'll be disappointed ... it's a great little game !!!😄👩\u200d🍳😁"", ""The new ads that pop up when you try to collect something are annoying and interrupt the flow of the game. If you want to show more ads, give something back like an energy discount rather than just barging in obnoxiously. Many ads are buggy, don't load properly and can't be exited out of. There is also a bug where items disappear from inventory.

<i>About Westland Survival</i>

In the Wild West of the Great American prairies, outlaws and even sheriffs are ready to sell brave men out for a fistful of dollars. Frontier pioneers and bounty hunters have set carriage treks towards the fabled gold discovery sites in Klondike and Yukon, and to the great plains and deserts of Texas or New Mexico.

Your wagon convoy ran into a bandit ambush and left you behind as the only survivor, but certainly grim with anger to bring those gunslingers to the hangman! Or shoot them right off their horses!

But before, there’s some crafting to do - a shelter for the night, some wood logging for bow and arrows, maybe even mining some ore for horse shoes and trading with the Indians. Perhaps they can teach you how to hunt deer for cooking a steak…

I had an issue with them and taking my money but not giving me what I was supposed to. I just started playing this one and already it takes way to much food to regenerate health absolutely absurd amounts. Then game play freezes in piny woods just when I get a few guns and boom attacked by a wolf and lost everything. I guess on to the next game.', 'Need to add a buyer merchant in town-one that will buy your collected loot. Both armor and weapon repair should be easily accessible in town & should accept coin for repair of items. Items that are purchased with hard cash (weapon packs, armor packs)should have more longevity..its not right that they wear down so quickly after paying real $ for them. Also, if money was paid we shouldnt lose these items in death. The general look and motive of the game is great. But the setbacks are horrid.', 'Great game. I think things degrade too quickly especially the things that took quite a bit to make. Also lil info about missions would be nice. E.G. canyon trials...used energy to get there just to find out i cant do anything because i didnt bring the altar offering...which u dont know what that is until u get there. Also think the upgrade cost for floors is steep! However i do like that i dont lose everything upon death. Well done. Couple of tweaks would make it a 5star game.', 'Well, I spoke too soon. Every game does work except westland survival. I played pool. And other games today with no problem. Westland Survival used to work too. I got to level 62 with no problem until the update 4. One was slow to load. But it is fixed now. Thank you for redponding, be Im reinstalling your game once again. I will keep you posted. I figured out the problem. I had to reconnect my phone to my computer. So far do good.', 'This is one of the best games i have ever played however i have a few notes : I wish we could interact with other gamers in Town and also actually get to use the furniture in the house, why is getting information for neighbors so expensive only for them to disappear after an hour? Do we have to be lone rangers cant we meet suitors and actually have families or something. Its lonely in the ranch', ""I've been trying to finish the stable for weeks!! Finding horseshoes is impossible! BUT other than that, I'm really enjoying the game it's rather addictive. Makes you think. EDIT- IT CRASHED!!! I just got all the horseshoes, finalized the stable and it crashed! I'm uninstalling and installing again to see if that fixes it..."", ""Fun but limiting game. Could you please restrict the 'lose all items at death', to ruins/canyon challenges, or remove it completely? Also, please reduce the energy requirement, and walk time (to at most 3mins for furthest walkable distances). Finally, reduce the 'real money' purchase prices. You could also incorporate ads-watching for speeding up crafting; and small daily tasks completions for helpful survival rewards. Thank you so much."", ""Comes down to pay to win! If you die you loose all your supplies. You need gear to survive here! You'll be out minding your own business then you get attacked for no reason at all.

Don't bother"", 'Oh man, this game is awesome!!!!!! No game is perfect but the developers listen to what people say and update really frequently, the game is challenging but not so much that it\'s needlessly frustrating, and it\'s also gorgeous. The only things I would change would be more customizable physical features and maybe the option to befriend or romance an npc but that\'s just a ""hmm, would be nice"" kind of thought. It\'s so much fun!!', ""Everyone out here complaining about losing everything when you die, I agree, it does suck. But I've managed to play for a month and only died once early on. If your smart about what you do it's quite easy. ANNDD The developers are trailing a soft death option (for the 8 year olds) as we speak, so have patience. Small negatvie, it's not made very clear that when your purchasing a box you receive a random item from the box, not ALL the items displayed. Would've caught many people out, be careful!"", ""Love this game! You dont need to pay to progress, but it does slow you down. The biggest drawback is carrying loot. You need a bigger backpack or the ability to get one as soon as possible... of course, you can buy one! Crafting one will take a while! And energy runs out quick, so play it slow if you're not going to pay!"", 'Decent game.. although we need more loot more locations.. more quests.. and a chance to get the loot back when we die . And maybe a game of old school poker at the saloon in town to gain more coins etc.. and if possible a chance to sell unwanted items for coins .. and more base raids without paying to many coins.. but other than that very well designed game..', 'So far this game has been fun and a little addictive. No issues that I have seen. No adds except for the ones for free stuff. Energy is slightly annoying to have to have to get to places faster but I guess that just makes the game last longer. All in all the game is fun to play. Thank you for the fun free game.', ""I have been playing this game for about a year now, at the beginning I thought it was GREAT. It's fun, there is tons to do if you have an idea on the important things. Then update after update the creators really made this game 1000X better than before. Always updating to better game play. By far one of my favorites games to sit and toy with. I recommend this game if you come across it! Good work guys !"", ""We've reached a sad time when Developers want $45 USD for nails, and over $100 for a room, and every single thing in the game costs money. This is beyond greedy and after just the 2nd day of game play and about 2 hours total, there's absolutely no way to advance. You get attacked wherever you go, and only way to survive is to pay a LOT of money for supplies. EDIT: To dev- You have them programmed to PAY MONEY OR BE KILLED. You're literally charging CAR PAYMENTS to NOT DIE. TERRIBLE SCAM GAME."", ""This, I can say, is the most satisfying survival mobile game I've ever played so far. I mean, I can delete my character and restart whenever I don't feel like I'm doing good progress with my character anymore, which is really helpful and convenient. The only issue I have with this game so far is the power of the Red Indian mobs which I say are imbalanced because of the damage they deal against players even when fully-equipped. Once that's fixed, this game's gonna be perfect for me. Still⭐⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐"", ""Not as good as I thought.. it's a really fun game but the only part that sucks is that every time you die you lose everything. That definitely sucks. Sometime it takes alot to get what you need just a lose it the moment you die. I wish they would stop that part, then it would pretty much be a great game. What makes it bad if you sit there and pay money for something and you die you lose it.."", 'Had this game before but uninstalled because it felt way too much like a pay to win game, reinstalled to give it another chance, but its even worse than before. Weapon and clothing durability is so bad that I cant enjoy the game as all of my time is spent looking for basic materials. Only way to get ahead is to drop a tonne of money. Will be uninstalling yet again.', ""So far this has been one of the better survival games. I found myself playing it in all my free time which is good and bad . But mostly good is a highly addictive game I'll give you five stars. But there seems to be a Greek in it every time I try to get the free chest it restarts the game and doesn't give me Anything. And it keeps telling me that the ads aren't ready yet sure you guys are on it thank you"", ""I am so addicted to this game and so gooood!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. I updated and keeps logging me out but I don't if it because of the weather are they update. it lag so much but keep in mind I've never done this before and the type of leg is not able to open doors and use items so on and that ' s why I dropped it to 2 stars."", ""I'm facing problem of connection error from sometime although i stayed in proper internet connection the whole time. Please fix the bug and one more thing, can you please make IRON ORE and SHALE STONES more frequently available in maps? I'm a big fan of the game and not getting needed materials ruins the experience. Please BRING TAR in purchase material."", ""Good game. You can pay to play but it isn't necessary. Too many items are only available via barter and via traders and you dont get enough info about where to get certain items but still a very good game. Upgrades take too long and require items that are too difficult to get."", ""Getting worse every update. Gathering material is more difficult, tools and weapons braking faster then ever, bandit attacks are a lot heavier... I played it everyday for a long time, but didn't touch it for a while now. instead of opening new worlds and developing new quests they keep on changing icons and the look of existing worlds and materials. New update now, but they keep on redesigning the same things over and over again instead of use this energy and time to create new stuff and zones"", 'Not interested in raiding or being raided. Looks like I wont be playing much longer. Let me clarify, I dont mind the game raids, not interested in raiding other players, or having other players raiding my ranch. Other than that I like the game, I like the graphics and the fact that you can move your avatar. This game is much better than games like koa, where you see the same screen over and over.', 'The game is fun for a bit BUT I have an issue with the raids on your turf. You spend your time to find better items and resources. The developers then send raids to you turf which you cant stop at lower levels. Those raids take your good items away unless you spend money to stop them... I know they need to make money, but that tactic is pretty bad', 'Enjoyable game and doing it in a western setting is fun. The downfall of this game, like other survival games, is the gathering of ressources and the INCREDIBLY low durability of items. When you have to make a whole set of cloths every time after you go out of the ranch to fight or gather ressources, it gets old and lame VERY fast. Clothes, items and tools should last at least a few days without having to replace or fix them. I hope the developers read this and update the game 🙏', 'Im neutral on this game.. I like the way the maps are set up and the crafting section is fun.. But it takes tons of materials to build anything and tons more to make new gear when it breaks.. To go out gathering wood and stone and herbs in one map area takes one set of clothes, 4 picks, 4 axes, 3 of the highest weapon you have unlocked and can build, 20 food and 60 bandages. Bandages are made from rare-spawn grass. OR you can buy the gear and materials for inflated prices.', 'Overall its a fun game BUT... Firstly, why does it have to be online? Sure theres other people playing but lets be online only to login and save + exit - inbetween can be done offline. Second, why not add speed ups/energy to the loot. I literally play about 30 minutes and then have to wait forever for energy to refill. Btw, the last 30 seconds can go as free - jus sayin.. Third, the space in inventory... REALLY?! 5 to 10 spots extra would be appreciated. Hope to see an update soon...', ""Been playing for years. Although, every update the developers seem to take two steps back for every step forward. Whether it be making your weapons and clothes weaker while making enemies stronger or further limiting already hard resources to gather. I think they're idea of making it a better game is focused on screwing over it's players."", ""Update: found the build mode. Lol. Think this is better than LDOE. I like that there are actually quests/bounty for you. Been playing for a day now and something must be missing. I've played Last Day on Earth nd thi is pretty much the same minus the zombies. But for some reason I can't make any storage containers, or any of the workbenches or labs or anything. None of that is an option. Do i have to be at a certain lvl? I have 1 storage and have to use the broken wagon to keep stuff. Need help!"", 'U know what I hate all of your previous updates except this one I love it but little more needed to upgrade for Equipment (weapons) . They are very much hard to find or created . I love the way as Bases will appear after every 7 days . Please Dude upgrade it for weapons they are so much hard to find or create . I lost all weapons in Spirit Cave but I found there useless weapons , I only love guns not other like axe etc . Thanks for your Awesome update :) .', 'Played the game for about 2hrs. Purchased a few kits to start me off. Game randomly said ""connection lost"" despite my internet and data working fine. Now the game wont load at all. Rip off merchants. Worst part is the guns and armour I paid foe will be lost because if you die you loose everything you were wearing.', ""This survival game is very good, i hope the developer can make a new NPC that allowed player to sell items among other player, or trade and sell system. So each other can buy/sell goods with silvers. I have very plenty of rare item spare, it might be good for other player because i don't need it anymore. I believe, with this system can be good and attract others to purchase silvers from the developers. I hope you guys consider my idea."", ""Gathering resources is the game itself! It's actually a FarmVille. Because of lack of content, progress is slower than a snail. You have a horse that u can't use cuz acid to genius logic u need to make a stable first but b4 u can do that u build all other work benches first and then upgrade. Travelling takes AT LEAST 8 mins one way unless u spend limited energy. Bag is very limited plus resources stack up to 20pcs only taking up so much bag space. Gears weapons break easily after a few hits!"", 'Overall it is a great game to play i gave it 4 star becz of the time gap between different places which is a way too much it should be reduced like max travel time for a place must not be more than 1 min as every one dont have money to spend on games and not the whole day to play. so i believe developer must do something of it', ""Story line is ok. Same as survival. But it's set up to suck money out of you. This game like most sucks really. I hate dangling carrots when all I want to do is relax and escape this crazy world but you certainly cannot do that here! That's just stating the obvious."", ""I HV been playing this game from the beginning near about 2 yr now. When u will be fixing the fishing in the map.. in early days there was a fishing spot but u no tar to fix the Brigid now when Brigid is done no fishing spot. Y so mean. I accept your all updates but it's not good coz I hv been trying for do long. map should be more bigger now, it's vry difficult to unlock new place.. why no fishing update yet"", 'Nice Game. Alot like LDOE. Been playing for about a week. Able to mostly controll difficultly by places adventured. Hate the random attacking NPCs that hit and run. Happens very frequently. Takes my health, uses up my weapon and armor in the fight then gets away and have to use healing items for nothing!', 'Started the game because my husband was playing it as well. Enjoy the game but dont understand why he is getting a case a few times a day and I am not. We are only a level apart and u have progressed my farm more than him. No instructions so hard to find out what to do or how to do it.']"

Thank you for playing The White Door! We fixed a few bugs in this new version.","[""Interesting...but short. I thought it was an interesting game with a few ideas I hadn't seen before in other games of this genre. The graphics are quirky and the style of the game is quite dark and hypnotic. My only gripe was it way too short, especially as it's not free. Felt almost like a demo rather than a full game. Should've been set over a month rather than the 7 days."", ""Don't know why the game is most underrated Rusty Lake game. Yes the game is too short for the price but it was a refreshing new entry. Inspite of new approach it never felt like it was not a Rusty Lake game. Please try to add more rooms in next game as it was little boring to be in single room so many days. Please make more games in this format."", ""These developers are incredible, the graphics and controls are exactly what they need to be, and the puzzles are challenging and smart. Sometimes infuriatingly so. But it's always worth it to figure out! I have played all of the Rusty Lake games and I was thrilled to see this title pop up in my game store. I will always pay good money for your brilliance, Rusty Lake dev team! I love you!"", 'Super disappointed! Quite pricey for such a short game and no where near as complex as all the other rusty lakes. I enjoyed racking my brain with the other ones but this one was too simple. And not sombre enough! Only bit that made me happy was in the club when we saw some of the familiar characters. I see what you guys are trying to achieve but not for me. Hope the next one goes back to the old style.', ""Love rusty lake games and how twisted and bizzare they are, this one has lots of familiar things from the rest of the games, however this game I felt was very short and far far to easy to an extent it told you what to do all the way so a little bit of a let down, the split screen idea I'm not fond of and not sure what or why it was needed other than be a little different. I will however look forward to your next release and will continue supporting these as they are all wonderful games"", ""Brilliant. I wasn't expecting anything like the previous Rusty Lake games but what I got was a different style game in the Rusty Lake aesthetic. It traded the overt creepiness that the cube series games have for a more covert, insidious creepiness that speaks volumes about mental health. It's a slower, more relaxed pace, and easier level of gameplay than what I'm used to out of this studio which was fine since it's so story driven. I'm glad Bob made it out alive. Can't wait to buy the next one."", ""I finished the game but it wasn't because the story and gameplay were amazing. I liked the other rusty Lake games but this one is missing something for me. Much less about the puzzles than the story, but the story wasn't all that interesting. It's also quite short compared to the other games, maybe 2-2.5 hrs at the most."", ""A spin-off of sorts from the excellent Rusty Lake series of pointy-click-escape games. The puzzles and general gameplay aren't maybe as challenging as those of the main series but it absolutely retains the wonderfully macabre dreamlike atmosphere which is one of their main selling points. It brings a cleaner version of their aesthetic to the party plus satisfyingly kinetic interactions that really sold the entire thing. There's also apparently a secret level which shades into ARG territory in that it apparently required people to phone a real phone line then hack apart a website and dig up actual stuff in locations all over the real world. Obviously I can't be bothered getting into that but I love the dedication required to set it all up (and to enjoy the main game you don't even need to know it all exists). All in all a joy to play and good to see the studio experiment while also keeping up their usual quality level."", ""I've bought all the rusty lake games, I was so excited for this one to come out, and unfortunately this one didn't leave me as pleased as the other ones. It was too short for what I paid for and the story line wasn't as good as the other rusty lake ones. I wouldve refunded this game but I can no longer do that since I've refunded this game once when I had issues with the payment."", 'Too short, lacked mystery. Rusty Lake is usually brillant for posing perplexing puzzles in a totally odd environment. Though I appreciated the narrative approach, I really wanted a reason to stay with it and uncover more mystery with context. Good try, but more substance and content would have been great. And a bit too much walking around to get through a level checking numbers and names, etc. Like a chore, rather than a funky quest.', ""I am a die hard Rusty Lake fan. They all had difficult and interesting puzzles, great stories, and all tie into one larger lore that I just eat up. White Door just falls short. It's good but when you compare it to Roots or Paradise (their other paid for titles) it is lackluster. That being said it is a good game! I loooove the duel screen aspect, the all white, and the style of gameplay. I would buy this game again. I only hope to see more from Rusty Lake."", ""I loved all of the other rusty lake games but this one just didn't work for me. I base my ratings on how much enjoyment i get from a game, this one just fell short of the mark. It lacked the problem/ puzzle solving element of previous games and was way to short for the price. Good luck with your next game."", ""Excellent game as always, it might not be a usual style of the other rusty lake games but I appreciate the developers for trying something different and it worked fantastically. Interesting story, puzzles are somewhat easy but it keeps the story of the game flowing so it doesn't really matter. Overall, great game as always!"", ""I have enjoyed every one of the Rusty lake games except this one. I found it to be extremely repetitive. I was so excited about a new Rusty lake game, I had no problem paying $3.50 for it. How disappointing. If your creators have run out of ideas, perhaps it's time for new creators!"", ""Rusty Lake & The Room lead the field with escape games. This is another brilliant offering. The usual peculiar and macarbre Rusty Lake story line. I didn't find it too short, as another reviewer suggested. It kept me happy for an hour or so a day over about 3 days. It's not very expensive for that. Please make more."", 'Nothing much to say. The game is fairly easy compared to the others that has been involved in the story. Although, i prefer it to be more like, the cave or something. But still,this is good. Probably lower the price,then its suit.', 'Awesome surprise! The Rusty Lake games are my absolute favorite in the Play store. I had no idea this game had been released. I was so excited when I stumbled on it! A completely new take on the series, while keeping with the same storyline. Did not disappoint! Loved it!', ""Yeah, the swiping in the story sequences is kind of pointless. The puzzles were hit and miss. It lacked the classic weirdness of previous games. Also this app keeps updating each day. The same 97MB update. What's up with that?"", ""Love this game! It has a smooth look and play style and it reminds me of a comic book. I loved all the tie ins to previous Rusty Lake games. I thought the price was very fair for what you get. Can't wait for the next game!"", 'Excellent news game. They did a great job of bringing the other Rusty Lake games into this one. Puzzles are challenging.. Pay attention to all the details. Especially in the backgrounds of the scenes. Great job as usual Rusty Lake team!', 'Rusty lake games are a weird and addictive series to play. If you are a fan, you can find a lot of references to the other games: Mr Crow, the Lady of the Lake, the moon scene of Rusty Lake Seasons, the gun scene of Rusty Lake theatre... It was very enjoyable, I highly higly recommend it!', ""I don't usual leave reviews but I've decided to here. this was really good - challenging without being too difficult, and easy to pick up for a few minutes here and there. I like the design and the concept"", 'A masterpiece like every other rusty lake game. I loved it, but at the end of every game I keep realizing I just know less about the plot and... idk.. i spent money on this.. I would have liked at least some answers.', ""A different kind of movement and experience but really slow, next to no puzzles and more of a story telling game than the old rusty lake style. Much prefer the old ones but it's good the devs are trying new things."", ""Once again another fantastic game yes it's a little shorter than some of the others but it's still worth the cash as you can make different choices each time you play. I absolutely recommend all their games."", ""Love Rusty Lake! Thanks for making another great game in this series. So quirky and weird and cool artwork. Love the puzzles too. I don't mind paying and supporting your craft & talent since all the others were free!!-For those who are complaining of paying the price of a happymeal 🙄"", ""The Rusty Lake games are few of the games I'll gladly pay for. I love the style, the story and the experience. The White Door was such a nice experience!"", 'Wow...rusty lakes best work yet...very story driven, a bit low on puzzles...but definitely one of the creepiest games....going in the right direction rusty lake...looking forward to more of your works', 'every time i play a rusty lake game i have to go back and play all the other ones. this one adds a very grounded and real vibe to the surrealism i look for from rusty lake and i love it', 'I bought it as soon as i got my first paycheck haha. Excellent game, even if it is not what we used to play from Rusty Lake i can clearly say outstanding work and thank you fine sirs and madams!', 'Another excellent game from the makers of Rusty Lake. I really enjoyed it. Please make more, faster!!', 'Beautiful game as always from the Rusty Lake series. Story incomprehensible as always too. Loved the puzzles. Finished it in one sitting.', ""This game is very different from the previous Rusty Lake series. Not much puzzle solving, but more like a visual novel. Even the puzzle solving is very straightforward and not much thinking is required. I finished the game within 1 hour, easily. (Of course, will take some time to collect all the secrets). What I like about this game - story, especially the romantic story of our pitiful Laura. What I don't like this game - puzzles are not challenging enough. Overall speaking - mixed review. It is less exciting than the classical games of Rusty Lake, but overall, better than average games of its type."", ""I love this game!! It can be kinda scary at times (witch i like) and it's pretty easy."", 'I am a fan of Rusty Lake games, was really looking forward to the new one. It has a , smart and dark feeling of a ""classic rusty lake"" series, but the new style was bit repetitive, puzzles simple and too minimalistic. Smart, though lacking some challenges during the main game, although achievements are quite tricky. The game is entertaining, great story and the connections to the other games. Loved the alternative ending.', ""Love the fact you guys did an ARG on this but I sadly didn't get a chance to experience it. However, that was something really cool that I don't see a lot of people do.For the game, I'd say the story was a bit dull. The dreams didn't really make sense unless you did the achievements and personally, I'd say achievements are supposed to give you some Easter eggs and maybe reference to your other games. Overall, great game and really worth the money."", ""The story was great, and as thats the most interesting part of this series I was glad it got so much attention. I was initially disappointed by the lack of puzzles, they made up a very small part of this game instead of how they're usually the main focus, but the ARG was so inventive and amazing fun that it more than made up for it. It's a cool, different game while keeping the rusty lake feel!"", 'I love rusty lake games. This is a little different to the others but still amazing. The games are so clever. Bring on the next one.', ""I was so hyped for this game, because i usually love the rusty lake games. I played though all of the cube escape ones, and also bought hotel, and nearly all of them are better than the white door. I really enjoyed the story, but that's basically it. No hard riddles, buggy interactions, archievements that you rather get coincidentely than by thinking. I more felt like an interactive story game than a riddle game, I miss the feeling of being proud of myself for cracking another hard game. 3/5"", ""Um.. that's it? I got done way too quick and thought that there was going to be more to it... I liked all the other games what's with this one I just didn't get it.. move the arm or cup etc.. 🤦\u200d♀️""]"

I absolutely love this game!I can't wait to discover all the wonderful worlds out there! 10/10 from me!Great game!!"", ""I really enjoy the game. It's suitable for children aswell as older ages. There are no ads at all which is great! It's quite entertaining, and can be a game to pass time. My only problem is that sometimes, the character doesn't reach the next vine when entering the next world, which, makes you loose."", ""I think the concept is stupid. Jumping and flying non-stop to get bananas is ok if your intelect is below the average. There is no mental stimulation. There is no stop option. Also I don't like the fact that I have to start all over from level 1 after I lost at level 3, it's very unfair. Not to even mention the controls... truly unconfortable. Quickly uninstalled. Graphics and animations are nice, though."", ""Well the game constantly stop to help you win the game and that makes the game way to easy,the worst part is you can't even turn that option off! The game within itself is very laggy and not exactly pleasing to the eye. The game mechanics are really uncomfortable. There is also no reward system and every time you die it makes u start the game from the start of the game. Honestly just don't get this game please!"", ""Need to contact developers for any problems is what told to do.???? Something about the implemation of the login that I cannot use . Don't know if it's on this end but or ifvon Facebook login platform or what I can't Google 0lay log in either Please fix on both on this Benji bananas and the adventures games"", ""it is a nice game but i think the cost of the variety must be little less and i have notice a funny thing over here that the monkey does not have his tail and legs i request the app maker to make benji's tail and legs ."", ""I can't believe it😥 its not gone fora year when i was a kid i used tk love this game soooooooooooooooooo mmmuuuuccchhhh!!! I love you banana benji but the ads but its fine no one cares of ads"", ""It's a good game.Good for time pass. This game doesn't have any ad which is very good and I also like the sound."", 'Good but the thing I giving him 4 star because it should not have as much multiple player event which should present on the game as I think', 'Best for fun time passing. Best low mb game that i ever had played. Very simple playing style,average graphics,simple story On total it is a good game', ""It's very nice game for timepass .We can also play it when we are free, new levels get unlocks in it.It is the best game all should try this game one's the you will play this game only."", 'I love this game as you can play multiplayer or 1 player and multiplayer is racing 1 of them is red the other blue', ""It was on my friend's phone the first day I played it. I'm so excited to put it on mine now! I found it to be incredibly entertaining, cute and funny. I really had fun with Benji Banana."", ""so as what I have experienced, playing this game is no easy feat, this game thought me to not giving up in everything we do and it's important for us especially for the children where they must learn on what is the essence of playing this game, it is all about striving, holding back, temperance and not forgetting to put on this one thing on their faces, the SMILE, after all the obstacles, on the end they'll achieve their goals and gained their rewards."", ""Good game. It's very addictive and entertaining. But, I want to complain about a thing: rescue squad are quite useless because they sometimes simply don't bounce me up when they supposed to (even without vehicle). Plus, add more costumes please..."", 'Nice game. Those who are crying because of controls must learn how to master them, those who say that everytime you lose, the game starts over... For them, most of the acrade games start over. You can pay game currency to unlock the levels. Great game.', ""Awesome game! I really love this game. Its makin' me relax. And the sounds. I liked it.☺️"", 'This is a great game,just see how the monkey go! Its so cool,then its just addictive but it is a very simple game that i know,anyone will love it,it makes me feel comfortable and ive forgotten my problems this is just a very good game...GREAT! You should try it..', 'I gave only 3 star because when we upgrade any thing like snake oil or tiger smash if fully upgrade in snake oil then if you only use it in to swing in only 10 then you will dead In also in tiger smash if devoloper is reading this than fix it', ""Love it but one thing is missing..Playing as the female monkey I would love to play with the female monkey but it's so good overall😊😊"", ""This game is sooo fun its funny lol but they're is some glishes my and my sister to has the same problome maybe try to fix it plz i love this game and i want the game to get much better"", ""It's really amazing!! Full of fun and excitements to reach the next world!! It has amazing graphics!! The mouth of Benji after eating chilly looks very funny!! In all it is one of the best games of android in my eyes...😋😎😎😍😂😊"", ""I play this game in my earlier time when i was small. I don't know this game name i have forgoten this game game name i have seen in my friends MOBILE the all memory has came back thak you for making this game . But you have to improve the graphics....."", 'Benji is really a talented monkey. I like to climb it on creeper of rainbow song . I like the different worlds of this game', ""I love this game, but unlike in the old days, now every time I loose, it plays an ad (especially stupid as it makes me choose between watching an ad to keep playing or not watching and loose, but plays an ad regardless). Can't recommend unless they tone down the ads A WHOLE LOT :/"", 'This is very best game and I like this game is jump the dress and very very fun and interesting', ""I absolutely love it! But one problem is why does it have to be online? I like this game too much I just don't want to unistall. Maybe fix it so some can play offline?"", ""This is a very nice game.... Wonderful, Adventurous. First I saw this game on my cousin's phone and I liked it very much. So I downloaded it my phone also. I like the greenery of the jungle and the sound made my the monkey ."", 'Very good game i liked it very much but it was hanging all has been good please fix the problem', 'I have given only 4 star out of 5 give because it have only 7 levels which i have done so after that it is of no use so please give more levels.', ""It's enjoyable... I scream a lot if benji will fall🤣. This game is fun💖"", 'This is a good game. But missions are very boring and difficult.we have to start it from the first level once the game is over. Other things are better.', 'Game is good and the graphics too but there are problems the world always returning when i get pass through it', 'This hame is full of stagidy and timing if play it one time it make me think to do better score and play one more time and the enjoyment after completing one stage it just make confidence to play game developers made a really good and relaxing game ..', ""i remember playing this when i was in elementary... good ol' days. but i guess many years have passed and i think it really does need a big update. it's still the same back then"", 'Very nice game with good controlling system. A non stop action packed adventure game.Also a very cute monkey named benji who loves to eat bananas.This games basically helps in the development of speed.', 'Really good game good time killer but I suggest to add some costumes to the monkey more or new characters', 'Mobile Legends mod apk unlimited all the time and the best way to get to the cinema is to make a difference in the world to the best of the best possible and best deals on the planet and its great to have a better understanding of the world and its very well and very welcoming and welcoming 6 and a very welcoming place to stay and we will enjoy the rest of the day and a lovely place to stay in touch with the family and friends and family and friends and family and friends and family and friends', ""I used to play this when I was little and now I'm a teen and I'm soo happy that this game is still amazing like it was before!"", ""Its a very nice game .it is really fun to play .it's an apt game for your free time entertainment .i liked this game very much.

-Quahog Historical Society characters now give their Buildings","[""Great game, poor performance.. Great when it works but it has many bugs that should be addressed if you want to keep avid players. Sometimes the game gets stuck on loading screen. This is a constant problem. When will it ever be fixed. I'm not going to keep uninstalling to reinstall to play every time this happens. Fix or lose a fan."", 'It is not a bad game since I enjoy playing it. In the past there were more characters available to do tasks to unlock things. But, they make up for it by achieving coins and trophies to unlock it. But, some of those characters usually come with their own houses. Example Consuela was a special character to unlock (cost clams). Because of the coins, you are able to unlock her (SWEET). When you unlock a costume, she has a task that requires her house... 🙄😔😫', 'Incredibly disappointed. Game is a HUGE money grab. Literally 10 mins into playing and already waiting 6-8 hours for things to complete. Valentine event requires you to spend clams. Or you can watch 10 ads in a row to ""instant complete"" something. Its free to play if you dont mind playing for legit 30 seconds, once a day.', ""The game was great, have been playing for awhile. New event started for valentine's day. While playing you get connection lost. You cannot reach Tinyco of info or fix. I have reloaded game twice did not help i have played off internet and off cell phone crash still happening. Dont waste your time with this game till tinyco fixes problem."", ""I played this 5 or 6 years ago and spent a ridic amount of money and got really far into the game and then no matter what tech problems wouldnt allow play. Started again about a week ago and am shocked at how much prices and requirements for certain things went up. Wish I could get my old game back. I will say that the watch ads feature to speed things up is nice, WHEN IT WORKS. The last 2 days at times its done nothing when I have watched an ad and others it won't work at all. Today NOTHING."", ""I love the game! The clams you get for free is a joke. What do you get now? 53? But when you get it down to 50 it says you need 2 to spin. Or when you watch a video to speed the characters activity by 2 hours it doesn't reduse the time at all!"", ""I myself love this game a lot but lately my game hasn't been updating and when it does finally update the event that's going on would only have something like 5 days left and I find it difficult to collect the things for free characters in 5 days. The game is not updating properly I really enjoy this game but something has to change."", ""Well what I can say about this game. I do love this game but I have a s10 and all I get is performance issues and my phone can handle anything and should not have any hitches on this game at all but it does. Please fix this and please fix the resolution. I have X buttons that I can't barely even press and etc. My rating will change if these issues that I have outlined are sorted."", 'This game is such a mess, there\'s bugs and for some reason bruce is no longer on the map, I can\'t find him anywhere, this game needs to be fixed like I started to love this game but there\'s just these bugs that makes you wanna say""screw this"" I really wanna love this game but I can\'t I\'m afraid. Please fix this game', ""I've contacted tinyco to many times about my account and was advised to close all apps restart phone which I did and even after doing that I would uninstall the app close apps again turn off phone clear my cache restart phone reinstall the app and while loading half to full way the app will kick me back to my home page where I try again I've tried several different phones and same response I love the game but if your loyal players are having similar issues please credit in stewy dollars or clams"", ""I love games like this and I love family guy! The game does crash alot in really inconvenienced times. It took gold coins instead of adding them a few times,really weird. But it's a awesome game,bot many like it left."", ""Played this game 4 years ago great game spent money on it to and got so far I had every character every building etc so I stopped playing .. back then it had problems with freezing and loading but my old game will not load now so I started again the prices went up so high and I just lost my clams had almost 110 now I'm to 10 e everytime the game loads it says here's your clams I hit the button and it doesn't load them back.freezes alot too"", ""It's a cool game. Been playing for forever. Thing is..... How can u unlock characters in like a week if the items r rare n u need like 15?????????.... I willnt spend my money on an app"", ""I love this game. But I've had several glitches since I re-downloaded it a couple of days ago and it's making me remember why I uninstalled it in the first place."", 'Game has gotten really tight with their collecting. Went 3 days before getting a character to give me 1 of 15 items I needed. Really going down hill.

Very disappointing 😢"", 'I effing love this hame but i open it and it just literally stays on loading screen i left it overnight and it was still there second device this has happened on i dont know whats wrong but please fix it then itll be 5stars', ""I have some suggestions for updates to the UI. 1. Make the text bigger. Some of us playing on phones have vision issues. 2. Would it be possible to change the character action menu to not have to cycle through each character. I'm thinking something similar to the character selector at Tan Lines could be used, or a checkbox system. There are characters that have quests, characters that can collect things, and go for the gold. These three could be separate tabs."", 'Everyone is having the same ""connection error"" message. No connectivity. Many glitches in this game. I have 4g connection. Also when u r able to sign in(which takes about 10 mins) it will give you clams then steal them back from you. I\'ve played this for over a year and put way too much time into it unfortunately. Don\'t think they care about it. I\'m giving up like the devs have I guess. It appears the further you are into the game(progress wise) the worse the glitches get. I\'m around lvl 60.', ""Will not open 😡. Have tried many many times over the last 2 years in hoping they would fix this problem. But still won't open."", 'irritating clams game keeps saying hope you enjoyed the show and gives me 2 clams taking total from 35 to 37 yet every time i restart the game it does it again and 37 clams has become 35 again.......', 'Fun addictive game. It does take forever to get stuff less you buy, but if u have patience its a good game for you.', 'The game used to be fun, until I started experiencing issues saving my progress to the server durring the thanksgiving 2019 event. I contacted support for help, but was told that the issue was a faulty internet connection, which I checked, and found to be in good working order. My issue with saving to the server has continued to get worse as more content is being added, but support has not offered a solution to resolve this problem.', ""When Google+ disbanded I lost my game file because that was how I signed into the game. I emailed support and was told they couldn't find my game. They suggested I sent them a screenshot of any past in-game purchase so they could locate my game via the transaction code and it worked. The was detailed with instructions on how to restore my progress and an alternative way to save my data so I wouldn't lose my game progress again. Pleased."", ""It's a time killer, and fun. Only fault is there's far too much to do/get by HAVING to buy it. I don't mind blowing an occasional $5 for clams, but every quest or seasonal activity requires buying....and a lot of it is ridiculously high. But you can plug along like I do, and enjoy the challenge."", 'Its a good game but like many others have said, the game give you free clams, but there not usable. Also it keeps crashing and losing progress. Playing this game on my android but never had these issues with PC (and no its not my phone as this is the only game that I have issues with). Also it takes forever to load. Please someone fix these issues', 'This is a fun game, there should be more options on getting the free clams. I cant seem to play the game anymore. It would freeze and turn black. Now it wants to update and wont. It just spins like its trying to update.', 'Played this game for well over a year collected many characters including the extra characters. Now its coming up with a glitch when I load up saying ""character upload error"" or something along those lines. The latest update clearly has a bug in it. The makers have since sorted the glitch with an update and given me 50 free clams. The makers of this game sure keep up with reviews and sort glitches out quickly. Keep it up!!!', ""I really like the game and even have spent real money because I enjoy it and don't mind supporting a game that I play daily. But ever since the latest update everytime I watch an add to progress one of the activities or buildings. As soon as the add loads my game crashes and this game takes an average of 2-4 minutes load on my phone which I normally don't mind too much but when I have to keep loading it over and over because of crashes....well that's annoying Edit- Now crashing every time I open"", ""Dont bother they have blocked all access to those with advanced accounts my mates who where advance cant log in as it crashes yet if they dont log in the game runs fine yet if you log in it crashes i keep getting told my log in details are wrong they are not they will not respond to my emails i've asked for a password reset havent been given one im not restarting my game because you want me to start again to spend more money its a scam i'll stick with the Simpsons Tappedout"", 'So far so good exept for the controls on placing objects or buildings needs working on.', 'Just got the update. Everytime I click on dog girl or a frog .I get a error code then game restarts.', 'Glitchy but Great Firstly, you most know this game is engineer to get you to spend real money. This is a shame. You can still enjoy a decent experience without paying. I love the game and Started playing when it was first released but abandoned due to glitches. I have returned to it, still interesting not as many glitches.', ""The game is a good time killer if your a family guy fan however after 2 updates it is still stuck on the final build the blimp. Everything has been collected yet it will not move forward the spot where the blimp is supposed to be built shows nothing, but if you move another building over it it sholws it's there, and the card to take you to the final part does nothing."", 'Its a fun game but it keeps on getting stuck on the loading screen and i want to play so please fix it', ""I've been playing this game for a long time but since the Halloween update I haven't been able to play have contacted tiny co several times and issue still is not fixed. Please fix it soon. update still am unable to play uninstalled reinstalled several times still nothing will gladly give more stars when i can play again"", 'The events are getting near impossible to finish and now this new event is crashing like crazy and not even working either. I feel like the developers stopped caring and are all about money only anymore. Sad cuz I have had this game longer than any other I play. Update: Now the events are delayed? Is this going to just get ignored like your other games?Update 2, this new event is ridiculous and impossible. I thought about spending money on this game but now never will']"

The main issue I had was the ads, they were glitchy. The game offered revives, double the gold and perks if you watched an ad video, but they never showed so the offers just disappeared. Also worse part is I tried to do a revive ad to no avail but as soon as it closed out of the battle an ad popped up. Really?!?!?! That is when I stopped because the game was just annoying me.', 'Good game. Spent a few bucks and got through content really fast. Now it just battles for 30-50 min at a time and doesnt seem like im progressing. After 6000 levels in warrior dimension still no bottlecaps. Is this the final dimension? Would be 5 stars if there was more content but still worth the download, and the few bucks spent.', ""Game is good but After the first dimension it's pretty much garbage in scaling. It becomes a game of chance, hope that enemies don't one shot your healer, it relies on ads. Edit: it was really fun after i got the ads to go away, so im changing it from a 1 to a 5. And if you change the date and time you can get free gold, enough to disable ads"", ""This is a very well made mobile game, the strategy element is amazing, the music is amazing (favorite is frozen city). A really nice novelty of this game is how you can purchase no adds without spending a cent! I also love the bosses that require certain things, like how you have to heal a boss, or have to use fighters to kill it! Overall, amazing game, and doesn't feel like it was made just to make more money. Also, the auto attack is useful for when I need to do other things."", ""I'm pleasantly surprised by this app to say the least, it's incredibly unobstructive compared to so many other free to play games I've tried, Armor Games has a pretty good reputation when it comes to games with me, dating back well over a decade."", ""Really enjoyed this game. This is a complete game by itself without any microtransactions and I love that. I have about 20 hours in the game and am almost finished with it. So i'd say probably around 25 hours total to finish the game. The game does feel a little outdated by now, but fun if you can get passed that."", ""I *love* the shop system in this game. Everything is indeed available for real money, but even premium stuff can be acquired with in-game currency if you have the patience to save that much. Even removing intrusive ads is possible with in-game currency, which is something I NEVER see in other app games. Other companies, take notice; THIS is how you do a shop system. As for the gameplay, It's VERY good. Repetitive, sure, but the game is ALL ABOUT starting over, so that's excusable."", 'great...just great, loved the game, and I still do, I am not great at writing reviews... or being critical, but I really do love the game, you dont get bursted with ads, and its fun in all, really fun.', ""Great game, one of my favorites, but I've had a glitch a few times now where in the middle of my dungeon dive, I'll take it off auto battle and my game will just freeze. I think it happens if I turn it off while someone is attacking. The game definitely deserves 5 stars if you fix this"", 'Not the best game out there but definitely keeps you occupied with all the different characters. The storyline could be improved, as we only had a simplistic introduction, and jumped into it. The character design is great but the designs for the smaller enemies should be less repetitive. While that is more tedious, it does add variety to the game. I also suggest an easter egg, secret route or foreshadow to who ""???"" might be. Instead of just saying it is the creator, and not have an appearance.', ""It's a good game. You can buy practically anything in game that's needed. Finding specific items can be hard but their online guides to help you. It does turn to bit of a guides later on but not so much that its unbearable."", 'Amazing! Everything about it is just great. It is a treat to play, I love how instead of just getting people to just come with you, you use soda to get them to do it. So why not play, right? So play for a while, and if you like it, play it some more!', 'One of the greatest games on the app store. A superb use of ads. The only required ads in the game can be turned off using in-game currency that is obtainable in a reasonable amount of time. I was able to do it within ~3 days of playing. All other ads are optional. The gameplay is engaging when you want to actively play but able to idle when you dont want to focus. 5 stars! Cannot wait for the sequel to be finished!', ""This game is decent. The amount of ads ands the AI's are not that bad as other people say. The gameplay is flexible with auto controls for those no hands times and even though it can kind of get boring (Which is why I deleted it 2 times) even if you get rid of it and lose your data on the next play, as long as you know how the game works getting back on a new file is easy. Still thought the Ai is ok but it does make you fell weird sometimes but not for long (unless the character has magic atk)."", ""One of the very few games I've been able to find that doesn't absolutely anhialate me with adds. I like the gameplay mechanics and the story at the beginning is hilarious but I'm mostly leaving a rating because of the absence of ads."", ""this is a beautiful game they give you options to turn off advertisement by paying with in-game credits that you can earn easily, it's honestly the best system I've ever seen so far and it's a classic game also great turn-based game or a great free-flow system with auto move options (would recommend for a pocket game that is free )"", 'Always had fun with this, lost my retrieval code somewhere so that sucks but I dont mind starting over at all. A little grindy at first but the Auto play solves that for me. Once you get to a certain point and character choice, the strategy to play becomes pretty significant. Great game, have been looking forward to Soda Dungeon 2 for a while and cant wait!!! Simple, Challenging, Fun. Good old school graphics. Creative bosses. Love it.', ""One of the best half idle games I have played! Can leave it open and it doesn't chew too much battery or make your phone hot like other games. Can skip levels so you don't have to play through the whole thing every time."", ""I've played hundreds of hours on this game accross multiple accounts and devices and have always loved it. It's a great game, although progress drops pretty quickly, and I find myself starting a party at level 1 and letting it run overnight and getting my loot in the morning because the higher level runs take so long. Love the game, would recommend (also a great offline game)"", 'Absolutely, hands down the best mobile game I have ever played. there are some in app purchase that are cheap if you want a boost but you never actually need them. great balance and great fun.', 'Great game, not like the new games that come out with ads every 30 seconds. Has a smaller, but still very well crafted upgrade system. Soda dungeon is a fun casual game that I find myself getting drawn back time and time again to play. Equip your adventures and dungeon on!', ""Very decent game. I like it, although may I suggest that when you reach the level 600 boss to have the healers attack with Heal spell on auto mode? I bought the speed up timer and it stops at boss 600, I could do it myself but sometimes I play while working on my computer. But that doesn't change my 5 star rating!"", 'Honestly. Best idle/quick dungeon game on play store. I buy new phones constantly, I\'d say 2 times a month minimum.without regregt, I find myself downloading it on every single phone for the last year. Seriously. Every single one. This game takes the cake and should get this year\'s award for ""2019\'s Cat\'s Pajamas""', ""This game is super easy and fun to play, honestly at first I passed this game by like 3 times and thought it looked terrible because it was pixelated, and now only playing for a few minutes I'm regreting not installing it sooner."", ""Just to let people know. This is one of the most fun and addicting games I've EVER downloaded. It never runs out of differing enemies so even though the premise may seem repetitive, it becomes fun because every 10 levels it changes. 5/5 10/10 100/100"", 'The only reason this game is not rated 5 stars by me is because of frequent supervision due to the 1.5 billion money cap. Higher money relic levels demand more attention. Thank you devs so much for giving me a game to play for years! Please make a sequel! From a dedicated player:)', 'This game has been more than fun. With its captivating gameplay and irony of its characters guarantee a great experience. A great dungeon crawler game. Plus, if you are unable to play there is autoplay! All in all, it is a remarkable game.', 'love the game, its fun and has a charming art style. the game itself is addictive, and the soundtrack is delightfull. While it is an idle game at its core there is something to it that makes me want to spend hours on it as opposed to other games that have done things similair.', 'First I thought that this game would be a regular dungeon diving game but its a whole other thing I love it so much to do + There is a very small amount of ads so keep up the good work!', 'I really loved this game and ai spent a lot of time into it. I hope that this can become one of the best selling games out there. I will miss this game so much. Btw I sadly uninstalled this game reason I am a teen that needs to study a bit more.', 'Rally classy 8-bit nostalgia graphics and turn-based fighting style make it feel like it was made right as color was introduced. I could play this for months and not get bored of it.', ""I love the game and the fact that you can grind to remove ads, but the way to save games is a problem. I tried to load my game and when I entered the code it said it expired. I don't know how it happened but I'd appreciate a explanation on how to prevent this from happening again."", '........ I indeed HAVE played this game before. And though I want there to be newer enemies and maps, gear and stuff, I still enjoy the game................ On my Kindoe fire HD I have reached around 16k floors,lol. I was OP as heck. And I really liked to my enemies fall so quickly. Lol.', 'Im so upset that i\'ve never played this before now. I thought it was like that one mario game where you slide the ""soda"" down tables. Just goes to show ya that those weird silent ads in the middle of your feeds on insta can actually help once in a blue moon.', 'Fun game! Easy at first but after 5th or so dimension change, it starts to get pretty challenging. One issue I dont like is how the things you buy in VIP disappear after changing dimensions.', ""Hi! This is Scalie Iguana, and I would just like to say; I enjoy this game a ton. The dimensions are fair for their difficulty early on, and to those who complain about not being able to advance because they don't know how to beat the boss of dimension(s) 5 or 7, just look it up."", 'Great game! The items are great and every level is at a fair level of diffeculty. But theres alot of recoulored monsters and lazy anamations, if the creators were to make this type of game they could at least take their time at the anamations.', ""Funny but needs more battle customization or qol updates. Having the ability to remove battle effects, text, or w.e. would help a lot. Customizing the looks of your characters doesn't do much if the entire game is based on battles instead of looks."", ""One of the best RPG games I've played on the app store. And if you make enough money you can remove ads which I think is awesome and more games should have!"", ""It's a nice, easy to play roguelike. Give them a few bucks and they'll turn ads off. You can progress without spending any money but, if you choose to, upgrades are listed in real world currency.""]"

I do kinda wish, though, that seeing how old the game is and seeing how the devs have sort of left it behind, that maybe gold and diamonds might be easier to get? Without paying? I know they still wanna make money, but maybe? I dunno."", ""Game is outstanding .It is mind make up game, refresh and it doesn't hamper on our time also because there will be interval of time to play depend upon the time taken by food to be grown. Each and every level bring some extra task and much more enjoyful. And entertain from hunting and exploring the different such a cave, houses, ect. Not bad so I gave 4 star.. and thankyou to the supersolid team for such kind of game hope you will introduce much more better game then this in future..😄👍👌👍👌🤘"", ""I have been playing this game for yrs and enjoy it alot. But the last 3 days it keeps crashing. Had to uninstall it several times and it started over at the beginning each time. I have started it over in the past because I wanted to, but didn't really want to right now. Today I have gotten the game to open twice so we will see. I would have given 5 stars except for the frustration of the last 3 days. Nope, wouldn't open again. Again uninstalled and couldn't open right after installing."", ""I gave this game 4 (and a half) stars because the game is fun, but you have to pay for a few stuff.

I hope other peeps would enjoy Adventure Town because I think it's great!!"", ""I'm very frustrated with warehouse and inventory. I can't find a way to see what's in my warehouse and sell items. I keep expanding it by using the red gems but I can't go any further with out expanding the town, which cost a lot of coins. Even if I craft items, it doesn't remove anything to make more room. Every other RPG and virtual towns games allows people to sell items and see their inventory. I also don't like using coins to participate in battles! I'm ready to uninstall because of this"", ""Meh, interesting but became boring and repetitive. It's cute, the quests were boring, not very satisfying when accomplished. It's farming and grinding to level up fighters, shops,weapons and armor. Nothing special. Did I mention it costs to have your people battle? It will kill some time but not too deep to invest time in. If you play, good luck with leveling up and expanding, it's not easy."", ""I've been changing phones for years and everytime I bought one.

As far as the looks and controls in the game, it's great."", 'A really fun City building rpg experience with an unrestrictive building system that really allows you to play the way you want, tons of activities to keep you entertained and lots of little things that really make this game stand out from other city building games, the colorful and cartoony style graphics look really appealing. My only problem is that some buildings take too much space despite the fact they look the same as others in size, Dairy farms shouldnt take 9 squares. Great game overall', ""The game is one of the only ones that I don't get bored of in 5 days, but I played this game 6 years ago once and absolutely nothing has changed. I think some new major updates would be really good because once I get to like level 20 I'll have nothing left to do. Would be a 5 star if there were updates"", 'This game is nice. I play this game daily every thing is nice .I wish that each lvl pass n we get chance of fighting boss monster.', 'Its super fun, id love to play. And also the quest is easy to acomplish. Im a bit worried that its hard to earn gem.', ""I like the game it's good but i don't like that you just gonna reapet and reapet upgrading buildings unlocking heroes and only fight monsters and Doing that Quest. I hope the game will update this stuff that i want to be at the game -You can visit other peaple places -You can fight people bases -Rankings -Pvp area -More ways to get the gems -And i want to have events like Hallowen , chrismass , and Etc -And every day you have a gift!

Could do without the expensive paid currency, or at least make it easier to get more/make purchases less expensive.', ""love this game just be careful cuz there's a chest you can buy and I got to addicted with trying to get new weapons and stuff and I spent all my coins"", 'great game smooth graphics custom characters etc., the downside is the quest, healing of characters, and building structures takes long to finish, and sadly the developers abandoned the game but this game is totally complete and glad they didnt decide to milk this', ""It's a cute little game but by no means a 5/5. It took me about half an hour to end up with nothing to do but wait. The warriors aspect is only relevant to quests, which just seem to be 'kill x amount of x enemy'. Enemies level with you so I feel weaker at level 13 than level 2. The other part of the game is a mindless loop of turning money into resources, waiting hours, and then turning the resulting resources into money, waiting hours, rinse repeat."", 'Its pretty good i like how they do the objectives and being able to rename change the look of your heros is pretty cool too', 'Game is finally working again, although my progress was lost. Edit: Crashing again.', ""I honestly really like it, I DO. Graphics is cute. It's fun but there should be more info about the items because it can get confusing and stuff shouldn't be so expensive. It's also a huge disappointment that this game was ABANDONED :( It has so much potential and I'm sure it would've been your most popular game if you guys didn't just suddenly stopped updating it."", 'I dislike that the objects need to take up so much space .. Everything looks spread out. I love desinging towns but it just looks bad. I like the warrior and getting equipment idea.. But why do you need to pay to fight monsters? I literally use gold go get the heroes why do i gotta pay to use em? Everything takes too long... Cant even complete quests till a day later..I thought you could use diamonds to rush things but you cant? Theres also no descriptions... Or even like a help button. Everything is actually expensive and takes a while to get gold so it gets boring when I wanna keep playing... I wish you had a way to add friends and play with others.This game has potential but just lacks so many things.', ""This game is actually a good one, since it's a slow-pace game with real-time development it can be relaxing and nice as you walk away and come back to find your products ready. You can customize your heroes, too, which is cool. The only draw-back is how long it takes for the game to produce the products and do the dungeon walks. Also, the prices on the gems are a bit high for as little as you get. I believe this game has great potential and I recommend it to anyone. 😎✌"", ""This is one of the games that stayed on my phone for more than 2 months lol. I love this game, and I continue to play the game 'cause I enjoy it. Easy as that. But... I hope we could click a weapon or item and could see all the infos, as well as improvement for the inventory.

It's a game with a story, I like it."", ""So far I loved its concept. I love playing town sims and strategic war games. These two in one game app is incredible. The reason I only gave 4 stars is that I want the hero's name to pop up above its head when I tap it. Just for fun. I'd like to see my name above that hero. Overall great game. Hidden treasure indeed."", ""I've played this game before. It's really fun. Best one I've played in a long time. I like how you can change your hero the way you want them and their names. It's much more personal than just hero's with preselected names and looks. I was really far in this game. Altough I have to start over. It's still fun. Wish I could give 10 stars. Compliments to all who developed this game."", 'Just started playing. I think its too early to tell if its a really good game. So far so good though.

Tinker Island - Survival Story Adventure,com.kongregate.mobile.tinkerisland.google,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kongregate.mobile.tinkerisland.google&hl=en&gl=us,"You're cast away on a <strong>TROPICAL ISLAND</strong>. Become the leader of <strong>SURVIVORS</strong> in this lost <strong>PARADISE</strong>. Take them on an <strong>ADVENTURE</strong> of a lifetime - build a base, explore mysteries or forage treasures. Learn the art of crafting, foraging and exploring but keep in mind, there is never an idle moment in the everyday lives of the survivors.

⚓ ⚓ ⚓
<strong>FIGHT</strong> vicious enemies, tame savage beasts, kindle romance and solve <strong>RIDDLES</strong>. When the island <strong>SPEAKS</strong> to you, will you answer?

<strong>FEATURES</strong>:
➾ Lead a band of island survivors using simple swipes
➾ Choose your own adventure and try to survive
➾ Explore a huge lush world
➾ Experience a talking island
➾ Fight many dangers that lurk behind every bush
➾ Forage resources to survive
➾ Build a base and upgrade structures
➾ Match, stack and collect flowers in a cool mini game
➾ Craft weapons and tools
➾ Discover a gripping storyline
➾ Uncover the terrible secret of Tinker Island

Three survivors find themselves shipwrecked and lost, not by choice, on what is believed to be a tropical deserted island. As they start exploring and discovering Tinker Island, they find great treasures, forage resources, build buildings and items that they need to gather, craft, build or harvest to protect themselves against the unfamiliar environment and the dangerous episodes awaiting them. A normal guy, a tourist onboard a ship, is forced to become a forager, a fighter, a true hero in this mini world adventure game. Find mysterious ancient villages and buildings, left behind by either wayward settlers or scum, discover an unknown civilization, uncover steampunk contraptions, covered with rust and almost unidentifiable. Not only is there no wifi in the caves on the islands, the whole thing is nowifi. 

As you progress and craft the needed tools, you slowly uncover the map, the monument, valley, the stars, the mountain and the treasures of the islands. If things don't pan out, retry. And then retry again. One hour, one life, yolo. There is plenty of wit and humor in the narrative, where you have to make the correct choices to progress through the story. Gather the needed resources to upgrade your buildings and unlock new areas and even new islands. Some are deserted islands, some are tiny islands with mysterious pasts, you may even come upon a Kraken. Maybe build a colony, a whole civilization in the rim of the world, but most of all, survive and complete the quests.

If you enjoy adventure games, survival games or even board games, this is definitely a game worth giving a go. It's a real treasure.

☠ WARNING! No wifi on the island. You're on your own!

Although it won't look as interesting in the start, just wait a couple of days and see all its potential. The game has everything, from puzzles to testing your memory and learning as you play. And the best of all is that it lets you be you. Make your choices, decisions and uncover all the secrets. It is 100% free to play and ads free, so give it a try and make it out alive."", 'Sometimes the app freezes, either when I launch it or during gameplay, and even stays like that even if I close it and relaunch again. It can be very annoying. Overall the game has a different style of playing, I like everything about it, except the freezing part, I hope it will be fixed soon to provide a smooth gameplay. 😅', ""This is a fun awesome game with easy controls and great story. It's basically like one of those survive on an island shows combined with undertale graphics included. It also gives you this your choices matter feel just like undertale did. I would definitely recommend this to anyone. Oh and if you're wondering at the beginning of the game that tutorial hands thing does not last forever although it seems like it. 😃"", ""I like the gameplay and story. There are bugs with the videos though. I'd be ok with losing the extra rewards but I lost like 12 hrs of idle farming of resources. It's frustrating as you need food to progress in exploration."", ""I like it. Has a nice side story and I like how the log book is kinda like a choose your own adventure book. But there are two things I would like you to add. I find it a little annoying that in the garden I can't restart the level that I am on. So could you add a reset button to the garden? and could you change the health display so that it shows the survivers current health next to their max health? Thanks"", ""Fun game, wish the tutorial didn't drag on for so long. It feels like a slow start."", 'Forgot to edit this. After my freezing happened I decided to uninstall and reinstall the game (I have the game remember in my phone) the game worked after that.', ""This game is great, I've had it many times. The gameplay is different to others and it is very entertaining. I have not encountered a single problem so far, even though I've been playing for a year."", ""At first it seems like a fun game but as it progresses you realize the only way to get resources Is to wait. You have to wait for hours for your people to get resources and that's all that it is. It's a good game if you have no time for mobile games but still want to play one then just install this and place your people on working stations :)"", ""I really want to like this game more because the way it's set up is really good. However, occasionally it gets stuck on the 'Labor Income' screen and won't let you do anything. The only way to solve this problem seems to be reinstalling the app (which is okay since it saves all your progress) but I've done this a fair amount of times now. I wish it didn't have this issue"", ""The game was pretty fun until I unlocked the build menu and realized the bottom of my screen was cut off? So sad because I can't progress without it."", ""This is the 2nd time I've installed this game, & there is one major reason why I uninstalled the 1st time & may again: the garden game. Nice idea, but for the 2nd time, level 252 is impassable. You need 250 points. Given that a plant gives you 10 to 25 points, assume we need 10+ seeds. This time around, I've kept track: Attempted the level 200x. Only 5 out of 200 times there have been 10+ seeds. 102 times, NO seeds at all. It's BS & an obvious ploy to make us use gems. Feels like a scam."", ""A game that requires imagination but is alot of fun once you play it for a while. I like the card style system and how foraging food and exploring areas and crafting new items. One problem i have is that the notifications don't trigger at all, so often times i miss out on what happened which is annoying. It would be nice if that was fixed so that i could remember to play the game. 8/10 stars"", 'Right now it seems pretty good. No forceful microtransactions, graphics are cool. Awesome game!', ""I loved this game. Don't go by it's graphics, minecraft wasn't being called as one of the best games to play just like that. Often times have to make intelligence choice to what to upgrade and what not to, depending on how much resource fees by percentage will be collected at some stages. Edit: I love the customer support and they replied me immediately in 2 hours and refunding extra 500 gems. Thus am double happy simply coz rest of the games customer support never worked for me."", ""Decent game good for idling when you want a game that doesn't need alot of attention. Has a good story and choices you make affect your overall game experience. Although I have issues with it's combat. Enemies damaging entire party when attacking and your chances of hitting the enemy on the attack wheel are only 1 or 2 chances out of 12. Ads are optional but rewards you with in game bonus and currency when you watch."", 'the story is ok I guess but the ""choices"" are annoying. You are given nearly no information on the things you have to make a decision about, some of them are so forced that both options are basically the same and opposite of whatever common sense would like to answer Other than that, the basic game is alright', ""Tinker island is a spectacular casul story game. The plot draws you in from the start and has you managing a team of shipwrecked survivors. I've been playing for several months now, and I have to say this game is perfect. Avalibke offline, dree to play, and extremely minimal ads are optional. Give tinker island a try!"", 'Okay time kill. Turns into a complete time waste on winter Island though when most of the winter garden games are reliant on pure luck.', ""An ok game for playing in passing. Buggy as all get out tho. Half the time when I open it, it will take a full 2-3 minutes to load, and then tells me my workers haven't gained any resources while I was gone, sometimes overnight, so i'm losing literally thousands of resources. Not a very entertaining game by and large because the internal mini game quickly reaches a very irritating, not fun point, and the only way to get past them is to pay."", ""I cannot explain how much I love this game! It's so brilliantly built, super smart gameplay and there is no rush to it as well! Just send survivors to do tasks and do whatever you want to do. Come back when the survivors finish their chores and send them to do more things! The graphics are wonderful, absolutely magnificent 16-bit pixel art style! The story is just as great! This is the kind of game that I wanted to play. It inspires me as a game developer to make something like this myself ^^"", ""I love this game! It's extremely addicting and the premium currency (gems) is able to be acquired without paying, which is always a plus in an industry saturated with loot boxes and microtransactions galore. Microtransactions still exist in the game, but this game is by no means pay to win. The only things I wish this game would consider adding are these •ability to rotate pieces in the garden minigame •a button to start expeditions and activities •ability to unassign survivors from activities"", ""I really enjoy this game, but since I can't play it anymore because it always crashes the second I get in (which is really unfortunate because I don't wanna lose my progress and deinstall it) I rate this game with only two stars."", 'Dis game has a LOT of bugs like at the loading screen I am stuck at it. Please fix dis!!!', 'I personally like pixelated games I loved this game!!! Its a different type of game that i have never played❤❤', ""The best survival game in the Play Store that's for sure. I really recommend it to those who are looking for a survival game. But if you don't like games that requires patience then this game is not for you. Great job dev! But I would request something for this game. After a long progress, the game begins to lag. Could you maybe fix that?"", 'Great game if you like simulator games and write up stories where you choose what happens for your characters....just needs a little touch to the puzzles (randomized win chance), and the hard/resource consuming combat system, for me, needs more gameplay or strategy (weird for smart humans that have weapons to lose to some animal with little to no brain) this game being pixelized is a plus but it needs a distinguishable fighting ""gimmick"" to pull me to 5 stars😜', 'i really like the game and im honestly reallys sad to say that it just glitched one moment i opened it and now its always like that. its frozen, i cant tap anything and im forceto close the app. i guess i need to delete it now. :/ really disappointed since it was actually fun for me.', ""Crashed, reset and clear cache doesn't work. All progress lost."", 'I really enjoy this app but lately it hasn\'t been loading correctly. It get past the main loading screen, and goes to open the ""resources found"" while off the app but it glitches there. I tried resetting my phone or disconnecting from wifi in case that was the issue but I can\'t get into the game anymore.', 'Its definitely a new and fun way to play a crafting style game but you mainly use card style', ""The game is amazing but there's a bug that doesn't let me open it, the resources gained while away show up too quickly and just mess up the screen, which freezes itself. Please I really enjoy the game but you need to fix this!!"", ""Fun, strategic, addicting, and multi-faceted. I love the garden mini-game, and this game plays really well even if you don't purchase gems."", ""I'm enjoying this game so far, the quest, the mini games, the strategy, the big maps, the characters, the little details, it got me hooked for hours, i love this so much! ❤️"", ""A simple minimalistic game that doesn't stress as much as other games i tried. Will always redownload this app😊"", ""This is a pretty fun game!! A bit slow at the start but it gets better :) I dig the 8bit style and the decision making within the story too! Looking forward to progressing and seeing how far I'll get."", 'I personally think that this game is really fun and has a lot of potential, the quirkiness of some of the puzzles are actually quite entertaining. In app purchases are not actually required to have a fun experience. Plus the pixelated graphics are cute :D', ""I like it at first, I played until it reaches the end, wait for the updates, so long and I decided to uninstalled it. Now I install it again to play because it says new island, but the longer you play the longer it trolls you. Can't enjoy it anymore. Uninstalled it once again. Used to be 5 stars game"", 'Great game play fun mechanics and little ads for a great and free game play', 'I\'m enjoying the game, but at the point in the mech island questline when you meet the person says, ""I see they got to your first,"" there is a typo which slightly ruined the introduction of the character.']"

And it is so soothing. If only there were more preset levels like the top rated ones in the level world, some of those are just beyond anything I thought was possible in the game! I think people shouldn't be able to rate their own levels cause then they can easily warp the rating to 5 stars."", ""The game is great! It has a neat design, creative levels, and it is a downright great game. The only thing though, in almost every level an offer pops up to upgrade to premium and when I click 'No thanks' it always gives me an ad to watch. I'm not intending to buy premium, which gets a bit annoying sometimes watching ad after ad just to finish/get to a level."", ""I LOVE this game's asthetics. There are parts that feel almost cinematic. If you play you'll know what I mean. The rabbits dangling from traps also are a nice little touch that emphasizes the hostility of the world. Gameplay is intuitive and interesting. I noticed the larger you are, the less force landmines or other objects apply to you, among other things. You could say it feels like the lovechild of Limbo and Flappy Bird, but it's really it's own thing. It feels like a PC game, ignoring ads."", ""Badland is such an addictive game, the art is absolutely gorgeous and the theme is so peaceful, the sounds are really satisfying.. It gives me such a calm vibe and there is so much detail towards.. Well, EVERYTHING. Overall it's such an addicting game so far, I've just started and it sets challenges for me. I HIGHLY reccomend this it relieves stress and gives you a smooth vibe. Amazing"", 'Beautiful game. Unfortunately the difficulty level is all over the place. Half the game (day 1 and daydream) is very casual and the other half (day 2 and doomsday) ranges from very challenging up to impossible. As it is the game is a mix of sublime joy and device-throwing frustration.', ""Everything about the game graphic-wise and play-wise was great, but i did have a problem with my gaming history. one day i open app when im offline and i find that i'm back to level one !! first i think that i'm just not connected to wifi, so when i get home i check on it again, but all my levels are locked again, and its like i have to start from ground zero!! its like my progress reset! im a bit upset because i was quite far into the game :(( i hope that there is a reason behind this situation"", ""This game is the best animation two player on one mobile game.The controls are good. That's all I have to say in this review. But don't forget to download this game.Its not a game of violence and the brain can not be harmed.But we all have to play in limit. I just have to say that it's a good game.And.......OK BYE"", ""A beautiful game if I'd ever seen one. the thing is that I would absolutely love this game if it werent for the army of ads I'd have to fight through every single level. Disappointing, really. If premium wasn't constantly being shoved down my throat like an annoying, oversized pill, I would enjoy it a lot more."", 'Love this game.Frustrates you just enough to where you want to buy the full game to continue it ad-free, which I did!The Graphics and sound are spot on for the game. Keep up the good work,guys!', ""I'm almost 57 years old and I managed to finish single player. The game is challenging but fun and different. Just don't give up. Keep on trying. Eventually you'll make it through the checkpoint. I used my touch screen and it worked perfectly alright. Have fun! Dan"", 'This game used to be great. However, without premium, I am physically unable to play. You must watch an ad to get to each level, and once I watched it, it brought me back to the screen to watch an ad again.', ""Bought it, but you shouldn't. A lot of potential squandered by no play testing. Instead of difficulty it's just easy then sections that don't work, which they obviously know because they ask you to skip sections if it takes a few trys. I'm used to classic Nintendo style games where it's really difficult at times but you just have to get better. This game will take some mundane concepts and just execute them poorly to feign difficulty."", ""EDIT ~ I'VE DOWNLOADED THIS FROM HERE, THE GOOGLE PLAY STORE ~ Why is ESET Antivirus flagging this as a security risk ? I'm trialling ESET and can't get an answer from them but ESET is saying that Badland is a risk due to hacking tools within the program ? I don't understand, I've played this game for a long time but no other AV flags it. Can you get in touch with ESET ? Thanks"", 'Amazing game, I recommend it to anyone looking for an offline 1 player game to play when they\'re bored. The only thing that i didnt like was that after every level, it showed their ""Premium"" game which got a little annoying', 'Very good game overall, amazing graphics, never gets boring, always introducing new things to the levels. Controls are incredibly easy literally just a finger. The gameplay is exciting as well as smooth. Would definitely recommend to literally everyone.', ""I love this game so so so much, it has the atmosphere, the cuteness, the coldness at the same time, its really eye pleasing to go through the stages, i'm really in love with it. <3"", ""The game is very smooth and very aesthetically pleasing. The sound effects and particles are magnificent and the gameplay is good quality and the power-ups and such are very creative and fun to discover and use. I wouldn't call this my favorite game, but it's definitely one of the better ones I've seen. Great job on this!"", ""Badland is a great game you should really download it it has amazing little levels some of them are hard also the storyline is great I love the game so much it's also a great way to pass time what does a lot of ads I think you should really download it only if I could read it any higher then five stars I would put it up to a 10"", ""For the people that think the ads are too long, turn off the wifi after you've launch your game. It will still save but it won't have any more ads. hope this is helpful."", ""One of the most annoying implementations of ads I've ever seen in an app. The ads are almost as long as the play time and most don't have the options to close after some time. There are a few that you must go to the play store and back. Limbo was better."", 'Excellent game for those who can appreciate a simple art style. Mechanics are simple to learn. Level editor is flawless. Searching for levels made by users is easy peasy. Like what more can you ask for?', ""I like itI like it because it's so cool and it has that texture and it's just fun I like when you turn into a cube and the different things that you could turn into and it was very hard but it's good to get your strategy up and good to like what do you say let's see oh yeah I forgot you're like it's scared for strategies because you need to kill that one and kill your brother something like in the game that actually kill your brother so I really like the game so much"", 'Beautiful graphics accompanied with a gameplay which is easy and intuitive to learn but keeps it challenging and exciting. The coop option adds an interesting dimension when you have multiple players on the same screen!', ""Loved this game since it's creation...but absolutely way to many adds I can understand a add that's 5-10 seconds but there are 30 sec adds between every level... Other than that great game...."", ""I love it. Something different, and beautiful yet fun and exciting. It's slow sometimes and has alot of ads but most games are. I actually want to pay to play the rest of the games, (different levels and different areas)"", ""Great game, everything amazing except the shed load of adds and the fact that when I reached day 2 , my progress was wiped and I couldn't get it back. It's upsetting that I can't give this game a 5 star review because apart from those two small things this game is absolutely astounding. I love the graphics, the game play, the movements and everything, I highly recommend this game to everybody and I agree that it should be more widely reccognised. I really enjoy playing this game."", 'Honestly a good game, but a few too many ads for my taste. Please make it so the premium version popups dont appear as often as they do. A really good game otherwise.', 'I really love it! The graphics are great and the style is a mix of creepy and cute. The only thing I would suggest is maybe a storyline to it. Like cut scenes and such. Great game!!!', 'Game is ok, but there are a ton of ads! Uninstalled after watching the 5th (30 second long ad) in about 3 minutes of gameplay. You have to watch one every level and every time you die. I get it...but the ads are overkill.', ""Guys, i found the Best game ever! It is really fun, mysterious and has the Best background of any other game. One thing i also liked is the fact that it has No tutorial, it lets u find your Way through, which isnt difficult at all! A few ads, but u can Just turn off the Internet and u are fine. By far the Best offline game i've ever played. It has No downsides! I recommend this game to anyone. I don't actualy understand why this game isn't as popular as it deserves!"", ""I like to give games a try before commenting and not be led by coments on other's experiences. Great graphics, controls are as easy as they come, physics great. Overall a great game. The downside...If you don't want to have to watch an add everytime you go trough a level or everytime you die, you have to turn your Wifi off. Still get the Premium plug every end of level, but it makes the experience a bit lighter. If you have a working phone like myself you have to play after working hours."", 'I love this game. It helps take some time away when I have nothing else to do. The levels are hard and challenging just like I like it. There are alot of commercials that I have to get through but other than that this game is really fun!', 'Loved gameplay. Too many advertisement. Cannot play even one stage without 30sec advertisement loading, and draining your internet package and battery. Was annoyed soo much that had to uninstall the game. The developer wants you to spend money!!!', 'I would have given 5 stars but this game will force you to watch ad every time you play, else you need to upgrade to premium. It was my favourite game but due to forcible ad policy, I am uninstalling it. Sucks..', ""Game is good but... Unless you buy premium there are millions of ads you get to watch. Best part yet, a lot of these ads are _saved in your phone_ Would have bought the game if it didn't fill my phone with ad files..."", ""Always going to be my favorite game. Sounds are all phenominal. The darker but strangely cute visuals are perfect. It's challenging but not frustrating at all. This is one of those games you'll want too go back and play again. I cant count how many times I have gone back to this game and just went back to each level until it was perfected. Lots of fun. Just a stunning game!"", ""This is definitely one of my favorite games of all time. There is only one issue I have apart from the whole premium thing. The version of this game that is/was available for amazon fire is broken. About a year ago, the game's audio on that platform started going haywire even when audio wasn't supposed to be playing. It still does to this day. I don't know if this version was abandoned or what, but I would appreciate an explanation as to why it broke, and why it is no longer available."", ""Really enjoyed the game, but just too many ads. I don't mind ads, but a bit overboard on this game. Uninstalled the game after playing for 20 min and watched like the 10th ad."", ""Never played such a good game... It's fun but not too easy, you need to figure out your own way through the levels which makes it super satisfying when you make it, although you can skip a checkpoint if your stuck, I have never ever seen an ad in the whole game(although I see others complain about to many ads so I might just be lucky here) and last but definitely not least the design is AMAZING I just love it huge recommendation"", 'Best game in my life, cool graphics, sound effects, and most importantly the creator value players who cant afford to buy the premium that is why they let us enjoy 40 levels <3 awesome and thanks creator godspeed']"

More filters in chat doesn\'t really make sense.', 'This is one of the best games on the planet earth,it has so many games to offer in different genres,you like parkour,boom!over 100 games and more to offer,you could also make your own game using roblox studio(only available on computer)where you could build and create your own game that you could publish,its also really fun to play with friends and you could add friends on there,its really good to play', 'Awesome app! I just wish... a lot of things. 1. I do NOT like how u cant say numbers and stuff. Its not even harmful! 2. I had the best idea. What if... Bloxburg had a newspaper? When looking for jobs, ppl can be editors, reporters, photographers... 3. So i was playing Royale High today, and i kept getting kicked from the app. My phone was all like, ""Unfortunately, Roblox has stopped."" It is driving me CRAZY!!!!', ""This is a three star because every time I go in a game it works smooth. But ever since this last update, my Roblox on my phone just never loads. At first I thought it was because where I was there was bad internet. I restarted the router 4 times and it wasn't the wifi. I went into many other games that require wifi and they all worked fine. I come here to uninstall and reinstall and I decided to scroll through the comments. It seems like I'm not the only one having this problem as I scroll"", ""It's a pretty decent game, but alot of people get away with things such as hacking and other stuff that can seriously hurt somebody. I have personally never experienced it and I do really enjoy this game. Not trying to be rude, but I hope in the future they can have a thing were they can directly see what happens and can unban/somehow unhack the player. I still recommend this game and rate it 5 stars."", ""Roblox is a very good game and can be enjoyed by all ages. The controls are easy to use. I do have some problems though. Whenever I play a game, it will let me play for a while before restarting roblox or disconnecting me. Sometimes it kicks me off instantly. It's not just happening to me and it's really annoying when I'm trying to play. If you could fix this, I would give it 5 stars. Thanks🙂"", ""Two words: Ultra Fantastic. The best game I have ever played (No lies)!!! I got into a bit of trouble because I wouldn't stop playing😂!!! But it could be better on phone since its really laggy and it wouldn't accept my email saying they cant verify it and it sometimes keeps not allowing me to get into the roblox itself and thats the reasons this game gets a four."", ""This game is great and a lot of fun but I have a problem with logging in. I forgot the password to my account, so I started a new one, but then, I learned I could've just entered my number and gotten a code to get it back. But it made me make a new password for my new account. Could you please fix this somehow? I spent a lot on the last account.""]"

Great game, just noticed an issue, my cutlass keeps switching from 67 damage up to 73 damage.. I took screen shots, but what can I do to fix it?

I wish I could be on your development team!!', ""After four everlasting years of endless waiting, it's finally arrived. This game is incredible! The controls are a bit weird, but I've gotten used to them. I have beaten this game too many times, on my phone, my laptop, my Xbox, my Switch, and it's all been an amazing adventure. I can't wait until Journey's End comes out, and maybe a Terraria: Chapter 2, or maybe even more work on developing Terraria: Otherworld if possible! They would both be extraordinary adventures, you know!"", ""I've owned this game for a long time, and, it's honestly one of my favorites! My only complaint is the change in controls since the last update. It makes the game near impossible to play, because the buttons litter the screen, and make it hard to complete the action you were trying to complete, but ither than that, the game is great!"", ""My previous review asked for either controller support or a way to revert to the old controls. I was pleased to find out that they did add controller support; mostly. The only thing that messes me up now is the fact that THE TOUCH CONTROLS DONT DISAPEAR WHEN USING A CONTROLLER. I mean, c'mon guys! Those two things virtually go hand-in-hand on mobile games, and you failed to do that. However, if this is fixed I will definitely leave an even better review. Thanks for your time."", ""It's an amazing game but the last update changed the controls in a way that made it immensely more difficult to control. I liked the old controls and the fact that you didn't need to machine-tap the screen to use the bow and arrow . Other than that the game is great and can last a long time with all the bosses and different armours."", ""I've had this as a mobile game for a long time. I liked it over the console version because it was simple to use and fun for me. The ui wasn't cluttered and it made sense. It was easy to build and move around. I came back to it a few days ago and was horrified. The ui is all over the place. It doesn't flow at all. If I could revert it back to a legacy setting I'd be alot happier. There wasn't any need for it it's over the top. 3 out of ten bons. You ruined it."", 'I love this game.. but my device is a Android 4.4, every time i make progress just a little bit into the game , it crashes and deletes the progress i made, it makes me a little mad. I will probably get anew better phone soon but I want to let your companys know, make a way to transfer terraria mobile data to a different phone.', 'I truly love this game and my memories of playing it, the simple problem I continuously run into is when I push the main menu button in my pause menu, it does not save a ton of progress unless my changes have been around for over a hour. Other than that, I highly recommend this game if you have the money to buy it, it is such a good game especially for mobile devices.', ""Fantastic game. I definitely got my money's worth. The controls can be difficult at times but it is serviceable. The game is big, and entertaining. There is a lot to do, and you have to put in effort. The boss fights are entertaining and varied. There is a very large variety of equipment, and many of the items are entirely unique. It feels like a real game not an app where everything is running on a clock (And you can only bypass the clock using miney)."", ""No controller support, so basic, yet so lazy they cant copy the text file/format from all the other f*king versions of that game that have controller support like ps4/xbox does. Refund for being inconsiderate. It's a true shame, it's an amazing game underneath. Just 1 simple thing kills it. Thanks for listening to us. 🍌"", 'The controls are sooo bad why do I have 12 hot keys and 4 of them do the same thing and why are they not separate from the joystick. My hands hurt from playing this game just because of the joystick layout and functionality you have to be precise with it. Worst part about this is I candy just turn from left to right when swinging my weapon I have to stop and then change then swing again and some weapons are some what okay about not good in any ranged is the only okay route to go...', ""Love love love terraria. Has to be one of my favorite games all time, but I gave to agree with a lot of the negative feedback on the mobile controls scheme. It's way too convoluted now and actually discouraged me from even playing the game at all on my phone since the change. It would be awesome to see an update that would provide a way to revert back to the classic controls or have a sort of key mapping option."", ""I own every version of this game in existence, so I can go ahead and tell you something is off with this release Re-Logic. First of all: a lack of controller support DESPERATELY NEEDS to be addressed, as that would correct the controls issue. Second: the UI is cluttered. I'm happy that 1.3 came to phones (especially since I waited an eternity for the Switch release) but the UI is cluttered compared to the last mobile release before this one. Please address this and this gets 5 stars!!"", 'its good but problem. it doesnt have any gamepad support and the touchscreen controls are inaccurate as a star wars stormtrooper. i try connect my wire gamepad and it no work and when i connect bluetooth it no work either. it would be nice to have keyboard support to for the tablet people but its good. gameplay is good. controls are shite.', 'The touch controls are passable however they are hard to use when attempting to perform quick actions which is why there should be broader controller support or at least the ability to map controls to fit your respective controller. Overall the game is amazing and provides a lot of content, but controller support would make the experience a lot better. Especially for people who have hard time with accuracy on touch screens.', ""The new content is great I've played on mobile since it was first dropped on the app store and have loved every second of it. BUT I give it 1 star for current gen controls. Yes the UI has SOME perks and the menus are easier to navigate and such but overall character controls are a mess. It's difficult to play efficiently let alone really enjoy building like I used to building is a painstaking process now compared to what it used to be and game play itself isnt as enjoyable for controls factor"", ""I have had this game on mobile for a long time. With the new update maps that I have played on for a long time and maps and characters that I had very late hardmode things on disappeared. Another is the controls as the are all over the place so the only viable option in to play with and keyboard, but you need special attachments and other items at which I don't have. It would be nice if you could a setting to add legacy controls or something to have simpler settings."", 'Once again an amazing game ruined because of the update if you want more people to love it get back the old controls its way better and easier I advise you not to download it unless they get back old controls or even a feature for either using old controls or new ones once again I advise you not to download it untill they get back old controls! *😡😡😭😭*', ""i've been playing this a lot since i purchased it, and its already half a year and i have already reached the end. I have defeated Duke Fishron, Ocram and even the Dungeon Guardian. However, after i completed the game and after defeating the last boss i fought and won, (Dungeon Guardian) for some reason, i can't open the app anymore. Please help fix this problem i want to do more stuff in this game!!Thanks For The Update!!"", 'Been a fan of the game since its initial release, and got this for my long work commutes. I knew the controls would bbe a bit awkward on mobile but unfortunately I find them practically unusable which is such a shame. Check out the game in any other platform, but not on mobile', ""(To the Devs) I played the game way back when it first came out, stayed with it for a few years and thought you would never update. Just today I noticed you guys finally did it and I was thrilled to replay it with all of this new content. There is one issue though, I find the new controls very inaccurate and buggy. It might just be me but I can no longer fight monsters, I keep dying. The controls just don't feel fluid anymore... I'm asking for an option to toggle back to Legacy Controls. Thanks!"", 'If u add ""some"" old controls, I would also like the ability to move the controls individually (because i accidently grappled while on a boss) also tweak the grapple like a something that highlights where will the grapple go and holding the button farther from the button to grapple is a horrible thing cuz it will make it harder to precise where you grapple also (I don\'t know if its fix but) the magic missle is kinda uncontrollabe', ""The game is amazing, I know some people want the old controls and believe I want that too but ones you play more you'll get used to it. Me and my friends beat the game, and I hope the would include the old ones army and other events in this game. Because in Mobile you can bring it anytime and anywhere."", ""Can yall do some tweaking with the controls? One example is making it so that the max range the Smart Cursor can move is whatever your Placement range is (i.e. torches, acorns, etc). It's hard to play on a touch screen and do precise actions, and fumbling in the dark trying to slap a torch on the wall but the cursor typically shifts exactly 1 square too far for me to place one, has been repeatedly frustrating. Love this game on console, would like to see some ease of use on mobile."", ""Awesome, great, and easy to learn, there's endless possibilities with so much stuff one can do, easily thousands of hours of fun, yes, there is more stuff on pc, but mobile is unique for its challenge. I had loved this game for multiple years and I won't stop loving it, ever."", 'I used to love this game I really did, but then with this new stupid update I lost everything, all my worlds, and all my characters were all mixed up and eventually it got so bad. Years and years of progress I had lost. I had beaten every boss and had about every item including some of the rarest such as the coin gun. I lost it all.', 'Great game, and i mean great! I love all the unique weapons and tools, and its great that they have an online mode to! They also have very good customer service, and helped me fix a huge mistake I made with the save data. This game is worth 6 dollars, maybe even more. I instantly recommend it to anybody and you can try the free version, first. The controls are not the same but this game is still awesome and the new ones are easy to get used to.', 'This game has always been great, but now that they\'re updating mobile version to be with console, and PC, its improved. My only problem is that I lost all my progress in the update, I have of course gotten back to where I was, but still it was kind annoying. I 100% recommend getting this game as it allows plenty of things to do after you ""beat the game"".', ""I've wanted the game so much when I was younger and was a big fan, but now since i have it i'm getting used to the new controls and the old controls I miss but yeah you could update mobile Terraria some more. Oh yeah, if you could make a Terraria Mod Forge or something I'll like that very much and you could add a Creative mode and, yeah that's a suggestion I have for you 505. (Also add controller surpport)"", ""This game used to be one of my favorite games on any platform, and the mobile version was fantastic. But 1.3 ruined it. The added content is great, however the lighting is much darker, making it hard to see, even with torches. That itself isn't a huge problem, but the new controls are unforgivable. They make the game practically unplayable. Mining jumping and fighting are now a chore. If the devs simply allowed players to choose the old control method, this game would be getting 5 stars from me."", ""Terraria is a great game I love it it has all these types of swords armors everything the best thing about it is that you can fight things that you can't fight in other games it's one of the best games I've ever played probably the actual best I love Terraria and when the update for mobile comes out I will still be playing!"", ""Its a really great game and its one of my favorite mobile games. The control are hard at first but when you can master it its not that hard, just accept it. No need for the return of the old control, i beat moon Lord within a week after 1.3 released. Bruh just learn the control don't be a whiny wimpy Lil kid git gut m8"", 'PLEASE CHANGE THE CONTROLS!!! Not only is it way harder to use having to use 3 fingers to play correctly, the old controls were way better. I understand that you need to be able to use everything without going into your inventory and pulling it out especially for 1.3 but come on! The new idea of these controls sounded good at the start but there is so much more cons than pros. Great idea executed poorly. 4 stars because I still love the game. Also everyone has the same problem, fix the controls.', 'This game has brought me nothing but endless joy throughout the past, playing solo or with friends. But I wanted to come back, to burn a few hours, and what do I see? The whole UI has changed, leaving the game literally unplayable on a smaller phone screen due to all the buttons, grids and other features being clogged up. The mining changed, jumping, attacking, flying.Its turned into a mess for mobile gamers. All that I ask is for 505 to just add simple or original controls as an option.Please.', 'I made a mistake writing my previos review... Many players (including me) complain about the new controls, complain about how complex they are. However, after a short period of playing, i came to the conclusion that these extra buttons are quite useful, such as for quick potion use or to use a torch for a few seconds. The game overall is still amusing, fun and varied.', ""Terraria is one of my most favorite games without a doubt. This update has long been waited for and overall it's pretty great! Of course, it has some very obvious flaws. THE CONTROLS. WHY. It is so painful to have to press 2 individual buttons to both jump and attack. the entire screen is extremely crowded and it's hard to play. Everything is also a lot darker, and it causes me to die a lot.

I've spent 100's of hours playing this. The recent update[1.3]has made it more difficult to play. There are way to may buttons on the screen.

Beautiful graphics, relaxing music, and engaging little puzzles. Nothing difficult once you've picked up the relevant clues. It does test the memory when you pick up a clue for a puzzle you saw a while back, but the map helps. I don't worry about the fast travel. Perfect to calm the mind and kill a couple of hours. More please 😊"", 'So, I bought this game when it\'s free (wait, is it still ""buying"" when you didn\'t spend any single money?). I love puzzle so that\'s why I try your game. To solve the puzzle is quite easy when you collect the right clue. Unfortunately I beat the game in almost 3 hours... Overall, the graphic is great and you\'re quite clever to make the player pay again for the hints and ""quick travel""(?) around the map. Keep up the good work! ♡', ""I got this game on sale so it was free for me. For a free game it was good. But I would have been very dissapointed in it had I payed $2.99 for it. I finished it within only 2 days... Didn't need to buy any hints or anything to enjoy the game though, so that was great. Maybe have a longer game and it will be even better. Overall, for free it's a great game. But for 2.99, it's a little lacking as far as length goes."", ""Cool game, main reason it has stars at all is its decently fun at first. However, it is designed to be very tedious forcing you to go back and forth and remember where screens are (to try to both get you to buy fast travel and confuse you to buy hints). 3 stars because of that sketchy game design, it should be made to be fun without buying things.

However, some of the puzzles were obscure and illogical, and some I was only able to move past by brute-forcing the solution. I wanted to explore the maze properly but was unable to, since I accidentally found the right path the first time I entered it! 😅 I liked the castle artwork and the atmospheric music. I feel it's greedy of the devs to charge for hints and fast travel; I didn't buy any though & was still able to complete the game."", 'Game was well thought out but there was a lot of back and forth navigation which they wanted to up charge a fast travel mode. The hints could also be unlocked for a nominal fee but I like to feel I was challenged to justify the game. 3.00 a little pricey as I completed in less than five days with just a couple hours a day.', ""A bit outdated. Also if you want fast travel(A must for this backtrack heavy game), you have to pay to unlock it. You have to pay again if you want hints. If you play all in one sitting you shouldn't need hints. Newer games of this sort just have better graphics, story, puzzles and hint systems."", ""Great fun . Once I got going I couldn't put it down challenging but not impossible . The only reason I didnt give 5 stars is because I think not even giving a single hint without having to pay is a little harsh but its wasnt impossible without using a hint ."", ""Was fun, but when we got stuck near the end we needed to consult clues on YouTube to finish. A little bit creepy for my young kid, but in the end she enjoyed it, and we applaud games like this one that don't interrupt game play with adverts or inappropriate ads for children."", ""Amongst the easiest 5-star ratings I've ever given a game. As close to immaculate as it gets. Enjoyable, gives your brain a thorough workout, but you never get too stuck to give up. Nice visual style... and no ads! Say after me: NO FRIGGIN ADS in this game! May be my favourite game app developers."", ""It's not bad, it's a bit short, but most of the puzzles are pretty obvious once you collect it's clue. Only thing that threw me was when an item could be reused elsewhere, if you'd known to retrieve it after using it the first time... And as normal in the things you go back and forth a lot to visited locations."", 'I passed the game in like 2 hours. The puzzles are fun and requires logical thinking ro know which items go where. You will have some back and forth to go around the map as some clues are used somewhere else. The clues are also well made such that when you find a puzzle you will know which clue will help you to solve it. Overall great game.', 'Very fun puzzles. My biggest hangup with these kinds of games is remembering where everything is. Having a map of all of the places I had revealed was SUPER helpful! And I loved the camera that automatically took pictures of the solutions to puzzles I had yet to discover and solve.', 'Nice progression. Not much of a story, but the puzzles were fun. Good balance of difficulty without being too hard. I consulted a walkthrough a couple of times when I got stuck. No stupidly illogical clues like some games have; it was usually clear which clues went with which puzzles. Nice game!', ""I loved it. Beautiful artwork, soothing soundscape. Full disclosure, I solved two of the puzzles without first finding the hidden solution. This didn't detract from the overall experience. I recommend trying this one."", 'Clever puzzles. Lots of places to explore and things to remember. Graphics pretty good but I like a different realistic style like the Artdigic games or the game Rime.

Otherwise, its very stimulating for the mind and looks beautiful & detailed."", 'Fun but it was rather easy and predictable. I suggest adding a form of character development in which interaction with certain natural placed units to further an interaction and increase the time an individual can spend in the game.', ""K, this is fun, but the story is really short, i think it's only take 1 hour to complete the game, so please make more story, or just make the game harder, oh 1 more thing, fast travel isn't really necessary"", 'Fast travel and hints should be free in all games. Apart from that, a good game structure and content.', ""The 2nd game of the series I played. It is significantly easier, compared to the Lost Ship (or maybe I've become accustomed to their puzzles). The story is a bit boring, graphics is as good. You absolutely don't need fast travel, just move there manually. No need for hints, the game is relatively easy (or follow a free online guide). You can still buy them, to further support the devs, if you want. Oh, and the game is playable offline, no cloudsave and no Google Play Achievement."", ""Wow, loved it. I didn't pay for hints. It is very doable without hints. Finished in 3 days. Probably about 8 hours of game time. Very worthy puzzle game."", ""It's a little frustrating. Also why pay for hints if you have youtube? Hints are just YouTube videos. Also cannot tell you how annoying it is to be looking for a number and gave it be completely opposite of the map to the next number. Or before. Example... you must go through 64 to get to 63. The numbers of scenes are just wrong...."", ""It's a fun game very long tho but worth it the only problem I have is with the hints I feel like we should have at least 3 hints free and then we can pay for more but besides that it's a good game"", ""Very short, but very fun. Had a really cool atmosphere, created by the scenery and music. The puzzles were very approachable and well thought out, but weren't much of a challenge. It kinda reminded be of Professor Leyton on the NDS from years ago, but different and original too. It was free and on that basis, defo 5 stars. Thanks"", 'Perfect! Perfect difficulty for someone who likes puzzles. Not impossible, but definitely takes thought and some patience. A+!

Just takes a few more clicks to get to places."", ""I really like this game, the story's beautiful and well made, sometime it's kinda annoying to go back and forth between places to solve the puzzle"", ""This is a great game for people who love solving puzzles. Yes, you have to pay if you want fast-travel and hints, but I found that you can easily do the game without any if you're just willing to sit and think about it, or try a bunch of different possibilities. It was a great way to spend a few hours and I'll be looking into this developer's other games for more."", 'Seems like a nice game, but it takes about 30 seconds for the first nag screen to pop up asking for more money (on top of the purchase price).

Never before I played this kind of game that to without ads.', 'Loved this. Loved the realistic interior and exterior of the castle grounds. Very clever, mystical and thought provoking.', 'A lot of fun. A methodical approach works. I kept lists of clues and unsolved puzzles and continually tried to match them.', 'I enjoyed it. Nice way to relax. Nice to look at. Music and sound effects fit the graphics.', 'Well done fetch quest puzzle game. Where things belonged was generally easy to figure out when you found the in-game clues. A couple puzzles were easy to brute force without the clue, but it would be very tedious to try beating the game brute forcing some puzzles. Though I never got stuck enough to need clues, I think the pricing for unlocking clues and fast travel was very reasonable, at $0.99 each, especially since the game is otherwise free', ""Awesome game!

It does this even when pausing the game, minimizing and pulling it back up. The controls are frustrating. Characters run or walk a few steps after a jump making the ferris wheel scene infuriating."", ""Excellent game! Challenging puzzles with great stories and characters. Exactly the sort of dark humor I wanted from a Double Fine game. However, touch screen controls are frustrating at times; it can cause your characters to be uncooperative.

So why only 3 stars? The controls are ABYSMAL! The jump mechanic alone is enough to make you scream. Watching my character impaled for the umpteenth time in a pit of spikes really sucks the fun out.

Particularly, this game borrows a lot from Maniac Mansion. It is a lot more level- and puzzle focused and not as much focused on narrative. (You play out the narrative for each of the characters as part of the level, but not in a classic adventure game fashion.)', ""The game is quite interesting. It's not a master piece of adventure games but it is quite fun and the story is nice and funny. It's a good game and I recommend it. What I don't recommend is the mobile version. Don't buy this one. Get it on steam or a console of your choosing. The controls are simply poorly ported. It gets really frustrating to control the characters sometimes, especially if you are trying to speed around. And since you control 3 characters, you will want to speed around from time to time."", ""With the amazing gameplay and graphics...I'm completely baffled how such a talented team could do epically fail implementing a proper control scheme.  I mean what were you guys thinking? Not only does it take away the experience for the player...but this small aspect completely craps all over your hard work."", ""Bought the game just because of Ron. Read nothing about it beforehand. Finished the game three times for all characters and I still want more. Sure, it has its problems, control could be improved, ending is a bit not here not there. But it's definitely a great adventure game. I can possibly do some even harder puzzles too."", ""I had this game on my XBox and loved it, so when I found it available for my Galaxy Tab I was pleased! However, as others have noted it doesn't work. Although it claims compatibility and downloads and installs okay, when you open it you get nothing but a black screen and some emotive background music. I left the tablet for 3 hours when I went out and came back to the same thing, so it's definitely not a winner sadly.  Hopefully this issue will be resolved soon, until then I've uninstalled and requested a refund. What a shame.""]"

I'm playing it on a UMX phone, model: U683CL with 1 GB RAM. You'll probably need at least 200 MB of free space on the internal storage after installing the game, as the game creates a large cache when it's run the first time. It created a cache of 134 MB on mine. This is probably why some people consider it's stuck at the loading screen. It just takes a long time for the initial loading on some phones. Subsequent loads will be much faster if you don't delete the cache. That is why I've whitelisted it in 1Tap Cleaner. You can jump forward or backward and you can jump straight up. You can also jump while running, which may be necessary to reach farther ledges. Many things in the game can be pushed or pulled. An animation will show suggesting the possibility to grasp something when you are close enough to it and you tap and hold the jump area (on the opposite side from the run/walk side of the screen). Turning off battery optimization for the app and closing apps that are running in the background might help those who are claiming to be having issues with the app closing on its own. I'm on level 15 and it's tough. I'm going to check that sound under my feet when I'm up on the platform near the cogwheels."", 'Its honestly a really good game.It has fun and tricky challenges and sometimes it tricky, but if you think outside of the box and really pay attention to the little things you can get through the challenges!

If you don't read the game's description on the Playstore; however, there's no way of knowing that you're searching for your sister the whole time. But the only real disappointment is that the game is too short. :( They should definitely make a chapter two. Perhaps even multiplayer, where one controlls the sister; they'd have to work together, and they'd be no communication between the two. Just the understanding of working together."", ""This game is definitely one of the best Android games of all time. You will not find better indie than this. The physics are just wowing!! The way the kid's legs chopped off by machine, the way he drop dead, the animations are so smooth! I honestly never seen this detailed and smooth of animations in Android. In my option really worth the money. You can see how much developers have put effort to this game. Truly creative in making puzzles too! I rarely see such a details in each puzzle. Love it"", ""Had some problems with the install, but overall, it's a damn good game! You'd think a mobile port would suck, but it's actually really good! I'd recommend for people who like trial and error type of games, and platforming. The mystery is the best part, everything is shrouded in the darkness, and the creepy atmosphere is awesome! 5/5"", 'I rarely play any game on mobile. This is so incredibly well done. The visuals are awesome and the sound is fittingly eerie. It\'s a puzzle game and a tricky one at that. There were times when I thought to myself, ""how in the heck did the creator come up with this?"" It\'s challenging and fulfilling. Highly recommend, especially if you enjoy brain puzzles!', ""It sucks and the controls don't work. The character is a Little douchebag that doesn't do what you need him to. THIS GAME SUCKS! I actually really like this game but not enough to go through the B's of the controls not working."", 'Really creative and challenging game. Poetically gruesome. Simple but in a really great way, easy on the eyes. Controls are so cool. Wish it had more interactions with creepy critters and creepy peeps but i really dont have any complaints.

This gam soooooo..... much. PLEASE FIX LIMBO!"", 'Fun game. Slow precision timing puzzles. Some were relatively complex. I loved it. My ONLY complaint is that it is too short for the cost. 39 puzzles. I was done in just a couple of days. I came back and upgraded my rating to 5. I really liked this.', ""I loved the game up until scene 11....the controls don't work properly on the new gaiety note 10 plus he didn't jump properly and it seems to only be an issue with this part of the game. Every other part prior worked fine... But I've replayed this same section 83 times and died the same way as before because he doesn't jump. He walks off the edge to his death. Hoping for an update otherwise it is a waste and being uninstalled."", ""Very fun experience. I liked that you could play for very short or longer stints. Controls were only frustrating once or twice. Some of the challenges we're tough, but could be figured out. I liked that the game left you to figure out the mechanics."", 'This is a really fun and difficult game that your would need to use every inch of your brain to solve the obstacle course in front of you. I would recommend this to anyone who likes adventure and puzzle games', 'Absolutley love this game. Its a strategy game and you have to really think about what to do because theres no cheats, theres not even a demo/model or something to show you what to look for? What to do? Etc. It really gets you thinking', ""Very fun but for some reason on level 24 the elevator won't turn on I can't figure out how to fix it very annoying. I looked it up after struggling for a bit and still found nothing. A little pissed off but not upset with the game maybe it's just a glitch."", ""When you reopen the app on a Chromebook at a later time, the screen will go all black and it will allow you to move around but you won't be able to see what you're doing. Please fix this. Also I would appreciate it if you can map controls for a Nintendo Switch Pro controller for this game."", ""Bought the game today and finish the whole game on the same day. It's so immersive and challenging that you just can't stop playing. The money was worth it. Glad I was able to discover the game. Bravo to you game creators 👏"", 'Beautiful artwork. Toward the end some of the challenges became time-based and thus a lot less enjoyable. But loved the game overall.', 'Decent game. Pretty cool graphics and puzzles. Controls were very clunky and I felt the game is a tad short to justify $4.99 price point. On the other hand, there is only so much of the (though beautiful) monochromatic graphics one can take.', 'Fantastic storyline, this is one of my favorite games ever. I finished it in just a couple days and now I want to play it again from the beginning. Congratulations to the developers!', ""Just finished the entire game. I am sad that it ended.

I especially like how the game loops unless you reset it, your relationship with your 'ancestor' increasing by a generation each time. :) The only thing I would ask for is more time for the underwater puzzle. The time currently given is far too short, necessitating skipping an eminently soluble puzzle. Edit: Extra kudos for having the screen go either direction after the force into landscape mode."", ""Graphics were amazing, color was bright. I really enjoyed the game till I got to the candles and I cannot go any further. I know I have solved it right but nothing happens.

Thankfully there is an automatic mapping system, and a notebook that records key clues.

You can do things out of sequence if you like. The end was amusing and ironic. You don't have to pay for hints, there are no ads."", ""My only complaint is that it needs some hints to help you know where you're going.

I like linear games a little better. Games like The Room and Rusty Lake Roots. I used the map which was quite useful. I liked the game overall. Lots of puzzle and gorgeous scenery.

Graphics and story line we're great. Great idea, just a little too cerebral."", 'Best game to date! This took me days if not over a week, hour+ a night. Very challenging. I doubt most kids could do this without clues and even then I had to really think outside the box. I am so impressed with this.

Too bad because I really wanted to play.', 'This is everything I like about an adventure/puzzle game. Plenty of scenes and puzzles and it took me days to finish it.', 'When I started this is thought it very cryptic there was no flow and the hint button was not helpful.....until I realised if you tap the hint list ie 1,2,3 etc it gives you detailed steps to solve or direct each phase. Some of the puzzles really need your focus and attention the underwater puzzle case in point. It is possible to do it in the time it gives you. The graphics are well done story line is clever and the end amusing. The real test is to do it with as little help as possible. Excellent more please']"

Some parts get a little repetitive but the progression through the game keeps you hooked. Finished 2 of the 3 & looking forward to the last one!', 'Perhaps the game is a bit outdated. The graphics are OK but not up to par with nowadays games. The gameplay is very predictable, but still OK for children. Very average. Controls and stability are good.', 'Great to have all three games in one shot. My only two complaint is that they were all way too short and the ""hints"" were full on solutions. Over all well worth the money.', 'It is great having a game that makes you look for clues and figure things out to solve mysteries. Best is the clues you can get after enough time to search and not loose interest.', 'Simple, enjoyable suite of games.

Background Story -------------------------------------------------

It’s 1972. Love is free. Flipflops, English leather and bandanas are the height of fashion. Meanwhile the Cold War is more than lukewarm and a real one is going on overseas. Movements are happening. Environmentalists, the female liberties movement, and on the dance floors an entirely different kind of movement is overtaking the underground clubs. The winds of change are certainly blowing over the country.

Somewhere in the big city, in a tall, faceless government building someone left a window open. All the winds of change are doing here is blowing leaves all over Joe’s newly-swept floor. He’s been there for two years now. Working a dead-end attendant job making sure the building is as spotless as the suits walking the halls. It’s been like this for years, going from one soul-devouring job to the next.

Our protagonist is Joe in more than just name. He is quite literally Joe Average. Average height, average weight, average IQ. In fact, the only thing remotely remarkable about him is exactly how much he conforms to the median of the hypothetical everyman, and up until this point, Joe’s life hasn't exactly been biography material.

This is all about to change...",Follow Joe on his journey between past and future in this funky 70's adventure.,"1,000,000+",1000000,4.5698237,108336,26560,0.0,True,USD,True,22M,5.0,House on Fire,6591256262518052841,info@houseonfire.dk,http://houseonfire.dk,http://thesilentage.com/policies/privacypolicy/,6591256262518052841,Adventure,GAME_ADVENTURE,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Z75c5Ipm4KDMZH4oyoNffORAIp164wsjFR9cTsVEhyqL65B3Kwx-GEeirbWAH0AF6jw,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-gfIJl-P0Et_VRVnEnvGJBZ-9sMtDYpWiKv0SHc6XZSKlLZhBQTVk2KzVVZv7mq-ifG1,Teen,"Use of Tobacco, Language",,,"Jun 23, 2013",1580304865,2.16,General bug fixes and improvements,"[""This was a fun point and click adventure game, with neat graphics and a cool story line.

I would have liked to continue with puzzles to help the other two cryogen patients begin recovery. That would have made it 5-star for me. It'd be great to see a 3rd instalment!"", ""Probably the best adventure mystery point and click game I've ever played. Genius in it's simplicity of game play and format.

But very short story comparing to the price, and the end of story looks like that the writer had no idea how to finish it. A little bit more work and could have been a great game.

Whether they're free after watching a video or you have to pay for them through the app. My attention was lost and now I'm deleting the game with no plans on recovering it. If you havent already, try Forgotten Hill or Rusty Lake... those are the best I've played so far.."", ""This game is one of the best I have ever played!

Highly recommended.', ""This game really threw me for a loop. At first I didn't want to pay for the second half, but by the time I beat the first half I was hooked! if you like point and click puzzle games, give this a shot. you won't be disappointed."", 'Brilliant point click escape game with a great story line and snarky commentary.

The ""almost"" is because I love this game, like a fat kid loves cake...', ""The game is quite easy, quite good story, sometimes you spend more time by walking between screens, the time travelling adds nice twist. There are some small issues I didn't like. However the game has perfect atmospehere. Graphics style, sounds, enviroment, plot, everything contributes. Second (paid) episode felt somehow longer and definitely well worth the money."", ""Absolutely brilliant game i really enjoy the story based part of this game yes you have to pay £4 to continue to play the second part but it's entirely worth it. It's not a game that can be completed in mere minutes it took me about 4 hours but that is because I struggled at the beginning you have to think out the box for this game and I also believe it's one of the most original games i have played."", 'Very nice overall. The plot and controls are very carefully designed. The game has difficult parts that makes you think. Well done!', 'Great and fun. It was very interesting and not boring at all. I love the problem solving and the feel of it all; the nostalgia and the intrigue.', ""First when making a language choice it doesnt indicate that's what it wants you to do. The display shows only flags & thought it was part of the game. I chose a red, white & blue flag. It automatically goes to the next screen where you choose a character in the same language (which I couldnt read). I've selected the red back button & it takes you back to the choose character page. Ive also restarted the game several times & have not been able to change the language. No menu key for options either"", 'A beautiful, immersive point and click game with just enough deviation from the standard puzzles to count as truly interesting. The sound and graphics really add to the seventies feel of the environment and the ambience is a lovely distraction from hectic day to day life. Not bought here but on Steam :)', 'Great story, game created a fantastic atmosphere, hope they do more, knocked a star off though as the ending was a little bit of a let down', ""Truely excellent. Great story, very good graphics, keeps the brain going, thoroughly satisfying. Probably the best game I've come across."", 'I love this game. Very interesting and challenging.

I'd be really thankful if you fixed it."", 'The story was great and the overall game experience was great too, I was always in a state of curiosity while playing the game, so much that I completed this on the first day of downloading, it can be more better of course.', ""Although the concept is nice and I love the game graphics but I can barely understand what I am supposed to do in-game... The character simply can't always do what I want (obviously), I get stuck half-way every chapter and have to search for a walkthrough online."", 'Pretty good puzzle adventure science fiction game.. An interesting life story of Joe going through his unwanted missions to save earth by stoping of spreading disease.. Make more games just like Silent Age 😊', 'Awesome game.

Thrilling and puzzling at times, it's a fun game. Five stars."", ""I'll start with the bad: it's too short! A couple of puzzles aren't based out of logic. There is attempt at humor but just makes for awkward dialogue. The good: EVERYTHING else. The time shifting is an amazing element. The art is lovely and the movement of the game is really nice. It's more mental work than stupid candy crush type games. Wish the population of earth wasn't mostly morons so we could have more games like this..."", ""I absolutely loved this game! I played episode one and two. I've never played a mobile game like it. It was incredible. Props to the developers. We need more games like this for mobile users!"", ""A scary story with a happy ending. It isn't based on the multiverse theory. So the story doesn't really answer why the doctor was alive. It's an old-school type of time traveling story. It's long enough worth buying the chapter 2. You can deny all the permissions and still play the game without a problem."", ""It's a great game. Good atmosphere and excellent music. It could've been more challenging, though."", ""I was looking forward to playing this game until the permissions boxes popped up and the first one requested for approval on making and managing phone calls. Never have I had an app ask permission for that nor am I comfortable giving permission. It doesn't make sense that an app would need permission to manage my phone calls and this seems very suspicious. DONT DOWNLOAD THIS APP!"", 'Sci-fi adventure game, nice plot, descriptions and dialog. Puzzles are a little on the easy side. Still, one of the better ones for Android, recommend!', 'Incredible story, graphics, and puzzles though I wish the full version was free', ""Great timeshifting scifi story and beautiful 2D artstyle. Puzzling to find needed objects in various places but they are indeed findable. The flavor or feel of the story and visuals is excellent, and each area is memorable. Story has some surprises. Timeshifting between current, past and future. First half of game is free to play, then buy the game midway. And it took me a number of hours, but that's me, I take my time. But I don't remember how long, because it was about 2 years ago. I felt was well worth the price. Also had flawless operations, no bugs. A high quality product overall. Think I will replay it now. ... I feel irritated at people who think that quality games should be had for free or $2. The same people who expect to get paid for every bit of work they themselves do. Good original games take tons and tons of hours to make in design, software, and graphics, testing, sound, etc. A LONG time. And then it costs to have it distributed by Google etc. The returns are usually slim (a labor of love) and often do not achieve high volume due to market timing, variables of marketing, etc. So most indie dev's have to have fulltime jobs and develop games on the side.""]"
Hard Time (Prison Sim),air.HardTime,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.HardTime&hl=en&gl=us,"The toughest prison sim in the yard - now celebrating over 10 MILLION downloads!!!

Create your own inmate and attempt to survive in a prison where every sentence is a ""death"" sentence. Rub shoulders with up to 100 fellow inmates in a sprawling jail of 12 unique areas, each filled with fully interactive furniture and props. Plus a life beyond the jail populated by real civilians, with wardens enforcing dozens of different laws to stop you from making a break for it.

Each day, you will find your health and mental state slipping away. Both can be restored by sleeping - which is also a good way to pass time. You won't always be permitted to sleep, though, so consuming food and drink bridges the gap. These, along with many other activities such as reading or watching TV, can also help to improve your mental state. If you ""lose your mind"" you will break down and will temporarily lose control of your character (almost certainly getting into trouble!).

Your character also has a set of attributes that you are challenged to improve:
- STRENGTH indicates how much damage you can inflict or absorb. You can improve it by fighting or lifting weights.
- AGILITY determines how fast you move. You can improve it by jogging in the yard or scoring baskets.
- INTELLECT reflects your knowledge - including fighting skills such as counters. You can improve it by reading books.
- REPUTATION is how much other prisoners respect you. It can be improved by accomplishing tasks or intimidating others.

There are also opportunities to earn money - whether you work for it with a broom, trade items at a profit, or run with a gang. Having money increases your opportunities to grease the wheels and make your life inside easier.

You may find that you need to go to the toilet from time to time, in which case you must race to the bathroom! Alternatively, you could find a toilet to sit on or grab some toilet paper to spare your blushes. Failing to do so will damage your reputation and mental state.

I regret that there is more to this game than I could ever explain here, so I hope you enjoy figuring some things out for yourself.

Upgrade to ""VIP"" to enjoy the full experience without ads - plus access to the editor that allows you to customize your character and every other.

BASIC CONTROLS:
(*Look out for tutorials within the actual game)
The game uses buttons where letters like GTA represent what they do:
G = Grapple / Throw weapon
T = Taunt (interact with handheld props)
A = Attack (on its own to kick, with a direction to punch)
R = Run
P = Pick-Up / Drop

OTHER CONTROLS
- Press ATTACK and RUN together to launch a powerful attack.
- Press any button with any direction (or none) in a grapple to trigger different moves.
- Press RUN and PICK-UP together to set fire to a small object (which can then be used to set fire to a large object).
- Touch the clock to pause the game and bring up options to exit.
- Touch any speech bubble to speed through conversations.

PERFORMANCE
- If you find your device struggles to display lots of characters, considering keeping the ""Population"" option low.
- ""Speed Up Frame Rate"" sleeping will require good performance at the default frame rate.

I like the game.', 'I honestly love this game however there are some things that need to be added immediately. 1. If we become a police we should be allowed to arrest civilians, or prisoners whom do something wrong. 2. We should be given the option to also interact with whomever sim we want. 3. The stores and all of that should be open to us. 4. The relationship view should be the same as the one in ""School Days"". 5.

This game definitely needs some work. I literally can't even run through the prison without being randomly attacked by a warden or officer.

I've been taken to court 3 times in the past 2 days (in real time), and I won the case 1 time. Another thing is the fact that you can't choose what you want to say in court.

The sounds, the graphics, the challenges, and hidden truths to alchemy. I don't normally rate games. This game deserves it.

I am so impressed at the way this puzzle was ( very thoughtfully ) mind you,. Planned and executed! It is my pleasure to play such a well made Masterpiece!

Keep up this wonderful work on', 'Hello people 👋🏻 I\'m really enjoying ""The Room: Epilogue."" I saved up Google Rewards to buy this game & I see myself purchasing more from Fireproof based on this experience. I\'m only moderately skilled in puzzling & found the game intriguing and challenging. The clue system is clever and rewards patience, frequently resulting in a gentle face palm for me. Some of the controls were not intuitive, so a minor knock there. Overall, this is a beautiful and well-executed puzzle game. Nicely done!', '""The Room"" is absolutely one of the best puzzle games ever. Albeit it has it\'s own weak spots. Amongst them is having excessive chest puzzles and less various riddles; unlike the Room two that has more liberal environment and variegated mystries. Likewise having a few levels is another problem which should be paid attention if there are going to be more spectacular puzzle games from Fireproof. Wish you a great future👍', 'The game has stunning graphics. Effort was visible throughout the game and leaves the users a good impression. It has the most challenging and creative puzzles I have seen yet. There are no bugs encountered although one major problem in the game is that the brightness keeps adjusting to low which is not suitable especially if I were to play outdoors. I would definitely buy the sequel for this. Must download for its worthy price.', ""I love this game and the three that follow after. These are the only games I have ever spent money on and would all over again. I wish I could have my memory of the game wiped just to play it over again. I still do anyways, it's so much fun and there is so much, it's easy to forget it all and redo it again with almost as much of a challenge as the first time. Hints are free, but the game makes enough sense to not need them frequently. I HIGHLY recommend this game!"", ""Such a great game. The puzzle boxes and the atmosphere are mysterious enough to keep you going. I passed on this game for years. Didn't realize I was missing out. I commend the developers. Great job!"", 'A-mazing Game literally! This game is very well made, the graphics are awesome. There is a great amount of time and detail put into this series. It is challenging and addicting.

All are 5 star games!', ""The game is great when it works, but I don't understand why it's so hard to double tap something to zoom in certain spots. Some elements have time limits and I find myself fighting just to zoom in to perform an action. And it's not now and then, it's constantly fighting just to press the correct thing over and over. I really want to like it but it's completely unplayable."", ""This game is really great! Totally worth $1 if you like puzzles and escape type games. Superb graphics. Super smooth gameplay. Somewhat short, but it's high quality. Definitely gonna go buy all the other Room games by these folks. Nicely done."", 'So far I have only completed 2 puzzles but I am hooked. Best 99 cents I have ever spent. There is a guy on YouTube who finds complex puzzles and figures out how to open them. This game is like that but virtual and I love it. The ambiance created by the music is superb!', 'Thank god this game has consistently progress saving! Spet over an hour on this game disregarding the fact my phone was dying xD But loaded it back up and right were I left off. Thank goodness. It is a fairly addictive game and worth the $1. Kept me preoccupied so far😁 Looking forward to buy their new series. Might be complicated for some but they give you plenty of clues when you are completely lost.', ""Brilliant game if you puzzle solving and mystery. The music is beautiful and the gameplay is smooth and relaxing. Sound effects and 3d graphics make you feel like you're actually solving a real puzzle box. All the sequels are well worth the money."", 'This game is so awesome, really was wanting to start puzzling and was inspired by Chris Ramsey so when he showed this game I was pumped to try it out. 10 out of 10. The clues are in thought provoking not just the solution!', 'Beautifully made and very well built. The puzzles are a perfect difficulty to challenge but not make you rage quit. When you solve a puzzle it feels so rewarding! Will be buying the rest of this series.']"

Also, you have way less ads if any, than other games. Great job and please make more of all of them.', ""Usually don't play these kind of games because the puzzles are extremely hard or they want real money at some point. This game has a slight learning curb, but fun to play once you get the hang of it. Puzzles are challenging but not so difficult that you want to throw your device across the room. Good job developers."", ""OMG is this game hard. The puzzles are great but trying to figure out what is a puzzle or not and what does or does not open is a pain. There are no directions so you spend a lot of time clicking everything to see if it's important."", 'I genuinely love this game. This is my second game from the Adventure escape series and I prefer this one to the Hidden Ruins one.

I wanted to solve that puzzle with the family tree but accidentally hit skip.', 'Was a fun game until putting the letter together and the ""skip"" for 25 stars is so huge i accidentally touched it since its in the part of the screen to put the letter together. So i used up stars to solve something i was not needing solved. Very poor placement of that. Was a huge interruption of the game for me and a waste of potential hint usage.', 'Still pretty good, but an oldie I think. The zooming on the puzzles makes me dizzy and some of the clues are really not very clear. Also the hints are not as useful as they are in more recent games. Fortunately all these issues are not present in the latest games (which are usually a solid 5 stars)!', 'Addicting! I was looking for a different type of game since most of the ones out there are very similar. And this is exactly what I was looking for!!

I will edit my review if I figure this one out!!"", 'Nice variety of moderately difficult puzzles, however, it seems quite glitchy. I know what I need, but am unable to pick it up. Also, Back button and Skip are right next to each other, so I tapped Skip when I juat wanted to go back. Graphics are dated.', ""I would give this game more stars but the clues don't help. It gives you a clue to what you already know. For example as far as adjusting the emblem for the bird, it tells you that three rings move at the same time. Once all the rings are there you already know this. So it doesn't give you a clue on how to adjust it. They could tell people the flower goes at the top instead. Also when I was in the garden I tapped for the handle to make the water come out, it did noth till after I tapped hint"", ""Really good puzzles, challenging but not impossible. This is the second game I've played by these guys and they have both been fantastic."", ""That was great!! I played Asylum last night and this one today and I'll either be playing cult or carnival after I rate this. The puzzles weren't too hard until the billiard room. I won't go into detail for those who haven't played it yet, but that sucked lol. Eventually I got it but geez. Loved it, keep them coming!!!"", ""Frustrating. Got to a chapter where I knew the solution but the game had missed a step and not given me all the numbers I needed. Even the hints were convinced I had the numbers, but I didn't, I only had three of four. Was enjoying before then. Would like to continue playing if the dev can fix this bug. Spent all my points getting hints to a puzzle I already knew the answer to, but it wasn't that I missed something. Looks like something just didn't work correctly...."", 'Just awesome. The visuals and graphics are superb. The levels are a bit challenging, means you have to click at the screen to get an idea about your next move.

Either the tasks are ridiculously easy n boring or too difficult or impossible to work out because the clues do not aid enough. And it will cut to the next scene when you haven't prompted it to yet. Annoying and frustrating. Also the dialogue between characters is not entertaining n pointless"", ""No instructions at all. The introduction is boring and doesn't make sense. I got to the point where I picked up the letter i and it automatically went into a white square on the side of the screen. No explanation for what the squares are for.

Eternium,com.makingfun.mageandminions,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.makingfun.mageandminions&hl=en&gl=us,"Eternium is an amazingly fun and beautifully crafted Action RPG, reminiscent of the great classics.

Eternium stands out from other mobile Action RPGs by its effortless “tap to move” and innovative “swipe to cast” controls, and its player-friendly “no paywalls, never pay to win” philosophy.

With the exception of a couple of online-only features, the game can also be played offline after the content download completes.

Drawing signs to cast spells is easy and rewarding. The tap-to-move control is more natural and relaxing than thumbsticks, and it’s also truer to the vintage point-and-click Action RPG experience.

The game can be really played for free, as more than 90% of our players do. Purchases are completely optional. Gems, the game’s main currency, can be collected from enemies and quests. There is no limiting stamina or energy. The best things in the game are obtained by playing, not paying.

As of fall 2017, major new features are in advanced stages of development, including real-time multiplayer, town portal, and a fourth world.

Enjoy the visceral satisfaction of responsive, fast-paced combat, with spectacular special effects, pleasing sounds, rewarding damage numbers, all set against immersive backdrops and atmospheric, inspiring music scores.

Play as a Mage, Warrior or Bounty Hunter, wielding a sword, axe, staff or gun. Level up to learn new abilities and increase your attributes.

Battle skeletons, zombies, automatons, aliens, demons, dragons and many other creatures, across three beautifully hand-crafted worlds, or in endless generated levels.

Venture into dark caves and dungeons, explore forests, villages and graveyards, lay siege to demon controlled castles, brave snowy mountain peaks, travel to the moon to slay strange creatures among craters and canyons, and beyond, to the deserts, pyramids and jungles of the red planet.

Open treasure chests to loot gold, gemstones and battle gear. Equip shiny breastplates, menacing helmets and hoods, spiked shoulder pads, mysterious cloaks or capes. Protect yourself with a shield, or choose to wield two weapons as a warrior.

Rescue your tank, healer and ranger companions who will join you in battle. Use their abilities together with yours to create rewarding and powerful tactical combos.

Experience a refreshing storyline, filled with interplanetary intrigue and seasoned with funny characters. Hunt your arch-enemy, Ragadam, across the worlds, while trying to uncover and undo his twisted plans.

Progress from common to rare, epic and legendary gear. Find gemstones that fit in your armor’s sockets. Craft socketed rings and amulets, and fuse three of them into a higher quality one.

Unleash awesome offensive abilities, such as Whirlwind, Shockwave, Arc Lightning or Blizzard, control the enemy crowd with Frost Nova, Vortex, Silence, or sneak and assassinate with Smokescreen, Traps and Snipe.

Each hero class has access to about 20 abilities (skills or spells), and each of your three companions has four more. The game starts simple, but culminates in a flurry of tactical possibilities at high levels.

Once your hero reaches level 70, your experience points go into Champion Levels, which are unlimited and yield steady stat upgrades. Champion Levels are also inherited by your new heroes, so they will have an easier time growing up.

Aside from the three story acts, an endless progression of beautiful, randomly generated levels awaits in the Trials of Valor game mode.

I've played a lot of Rpgs in my life and can say that this game is average, it's not a bad game but not a classic either. Tbh, I've had this game for 2 weeks and I'm getting a tad bored with it already. The gameplay is decent enough, the story I couldn't care less about and the equipment is repetitive. It'll keep you occupied for a short while."", ""The game is a nice light ARPG with an interesting draw gesture system. The crafting system is great as well The game is much too simple however. The most important thing in a video game is CHALLENGE. Without it there is no fun. I dont want to blitz through levels one-shotting everything. That is not fun for me. Make enemies adapt to the player's power level and allow players to select any difficulty they want from the start. These 2 things will allow players to customize their experience better."", ""So far (about 90 minutes), really good. Gameplay is simple and fun. It easy to level up the first levels, and enemies are not overly tough. I don't know whether it gets more difficult later or not. The adverts are optional and you receive gems if you choose to watch them. Otherwise, you can choose not to watch them and simply continue with your quest. My favourite element is that this is NOT pay to play. Nor is it watch ads to play either."", 'This game is perfect the way that it is Its like playing Diablo. The controls are very easy The quests are simple to follow. No constant every 5 minute ads pop up. You only get ads when you find a mystery box to get more gems. And trust me its worth the watch you need gems to unlock stuff and makes the game easy to play. I really enjoy playing this game. I been playing it for days hours I recomend playing this game You can add friends when you complete a level. Theres so much more to it.', ""So far playing the game has been pretty fun the micro transactions have not been to bad the gems you get are plentiful if used right and you dont have to pay money to get through the game . The graphics are good,the controls are pretty good only complaint about them is the fact if you back up with a range character it doesn't auto hit you have to tap again to hit them . I highly recommend this game it's like a pc/console RPG but with the normal mobile stuff in it. My review may change...."", ""Gameplay is entertaining until you reach a certain level and then it's just a heck of a hurdle to get past, esp. when there are few tutorials or info for the game. Also some of the quests I've completed I've had to repeat over and over again as if I had skipped them, and I know for certain that I completed those quests.

This review should say something then. I primarily downloaded this to play during down times at work but I found myself pulling this up at home. It's a hub based rpg and very easy to use controls and features a very interesting way of using abilities via symbols. You can build a party, craft, transmog your gear etc. Everything you'd want in a mobile rpg. In app ads aren't intrusive and you're typically rewarded for watching short vids. 5/5"", 'First off I am loving this game. With that being said I have a few suggestions. 1. Less time to wait for abilities or no time at all. 2. Bank tab markers. 3. Higher gem drop rate, the ones you need to add sockets and buy chestes 4. Make it so after you get all five stars on all levels all chests are openable. 5. More achievements for gems. I hope this helps. Thank you for a great game. I still continue to play every day.', ""I have often had trouble finding good RPG games. This game however, is certainly high on my list. It is simple in gameplay yet woven together in a very effective way that captures the intended effect. It has a good storyline, gameplay and is overall hard to find any observeable flaws with. I am highly doubtful that other players would regret installing it, I certainly don't."", ""If you love quest games I swear to god this is it, they dont have ad, they dont try to get you to buy something every 5 minutes, you receive gems through out your play, and did I mention no ads.

I just wish it was a bigger challenge .I would recommend you try this game out."", ""The items and crafting are done really well! The game looks alright too but feels dated compared to newer ARPG titles. Cons: Movement is the worst and number one reason I can't keep playing or recomend this game. The lack of control options to move and attack using your thumbs. But u play the entire game with your pointer finger. Gems are the premium currency that you NEED use to improve far to many quality of life options. Many I feel like should be unlocked using Gold or after quests."", 'This game is fun and entertaining! I have almost finished one run through and I love the graphics and game play. Buuuuuuut, every time I attempt to play the very last level, it crashes when I hit the start button!! Gaaaah!!!!', 'I reinstalled the fame after a year still there is not much content but a lot of quality of life improvement, i hate to see this game put to rest there is so much potential. The developer has should put more ads choices eg the skill leveling or ads for refreshing recipe instead of five gems because it breaks immersion watching ads in the middle of the raid. Its better if u can watch the ads during loadout', ""So far really enjoying the game. Visuals look great. I do like how gold and gems are shared between your toons so you don't have to do major grinding. But I'm still early in the game, so that could change. Other than that, a solid game."", ""Are rated 5-stars so I can get the gems that's the only reason. It's cool enough that it's occupied me for a while... but I'm only venturing through it to see if getting past the normal stage of the game actually has you take damage. So far it's been extremely elementary feeling. Playing the game without fear of death takes away the spice and adventure. Game is long and repetitive and the options at the vendors in town are rather remedial."", 'Great game easy mechanics and good graphics, and one of the good parts of the game is that you could adjust the graphics and its so awesome and cool adding the great gameplay and the monsters are quite unique in their own way and so is the level designs.', ""Eternium's game save feature where you need to create an account is a joke. Issue was solved with support Great game but Still a useless issue in my opinion. Aggravating non the less. So 3 stars. There should be no need to create an additional account. If the devs want to draw people to there website they should try other methods Google play offers cross platform game play already with some games already."", 'Nice ""Diablo"" style game, I was looking for something like this for a while, currently enjoying the few first easy quests with an upgraded purchased weapon that was so cheap and irresistible, 4 stars because gem rewards are very little and upgrading abilities takes a lot of time.', ""The game is a little simplistic, but it doesn't seem to rely too heaviliy on Gem purchases. The gameplay is quite easy to grasp, and the gesture system is a good way of controling your character (especially if you're using a stylus).

Idk, it just doesn't feel like the same game."", 'Worth the Download!! Downloaded it on a whim. Glad I did. While there are a multitude of mobile games committed to vamping your wallet, this is not ONLY NOT one of them, but its story and character customization is pretty fun.

I would love to see some graphic improvement tho."", ""It brings me back to the golden era classic RPG with Diablo feeling on it!

It just goes on a continuous loop telling me to restart the app. I've even uninstalled it twice just to try and fix this but it won't go away. Please fix this for a 5* rating from me,as I really love this game. Thank you."", 'This is one of the more quality rpg games youll find on the play store. Cool collector game, with end game as well as newbie features. The chat needs work, and the story line too, but over all really quality. Edit: in response to the developer, thanks for taking time out of your day to talk to me. Yes, advertisement should be your main concern, however the community should be made to sustain the customers you gain from advertisement. This means an update to the chat and guilds. But thats just my two cents.', ""A good game ruined by bad auto AI bugs, extremely low energy (very bad) and despite having a great core concept behind the main character control the content is shallow with a low amount of gear options and customisation... everyone ends up as the same class and META. Gaurdian are a fantastic concept but this game simply doesn't have enough of energy (I'm done in 6 minutes) or customisation to actually enjoy it more. Fixing these issues would make it an EASY 5 star vote even for critics like me."", ""The game was nice and well designed; although it's not an open world type of game. The graphics was excellent, I don't experience any lag nor bug. But please improve the game's character level (improve its max level from 50) and guardian level to make it more fun to play. Also, add more guardians! I do admire all guardians in this game as all of 'em were beautiful and cool."", ""This game soo addictive! Keep update and add more heroes and others and it'll great!"", ""It is a good game, and I am captivated already by this, tho I can't get good guardians, and the players are really nice, especially channel 300 because they help newbies with everything."", ""This game is gross.

I went ahead and didn't do the background download after that and waited for the content of the game to actually take its time. The issue still occurred and is still currently happening. It's extremely upsetting 😔"", ""I've been playing this game for several months, the idea is good, but the most noticeable downside is, the guardians almost have NO A.I., keep targeting the empty space, hitting nobody and wasting the cooldown. Yes, they sometimes cast their AOE skill on the right target, but this doesn't mean they have A.I. -- The target is completely random, not an efficient fight and wasting so much of your time. Others like too buggy and bad foreign language translation."", ""The only issue i have with this game was that whenever i tried to participate in the 'world boss' i couldn't. This was because everyone was way to powerful( i'm currently level 24) and could beat it within 5 minutes of the challage being open. I strongly suggest that you make groups based on the level of the player so everyone can participate with the world boss and not just ridiculously over-powered players, however i still love this game and love the time tou put into this game 😁😁"", 'Hello Trollgames, i really enjoying this game but there is some bug issue some of guardian doesnt have animation skill and attacks, like Lucifer and Farnesse maybe others too.

Its like based on summoners war then a rpg game where you use skills.. feels boring, cause getting 6* is so easy that u just have to auto every quest and get the in game currency for scrolls, seriously? I only loved this game for a year cause of dark buddha,replaying it now feels boring, i'll just play summoners war instead, this game needs more original ideas, but I have no issue, this game is not P2W which is the one that hooked me for 2 years in the game, though another problem is, I was buying crystals for scrolls before, guess what I restarted the game but it seems that there are 15 crystals left which was supposed to be 214, then I look at my inventory new 3* units were there?

I have been playing it for the past 6 hours now, the game play is smooth, they give you A LOT of goodies when you start playing, but I have to say as an avid lover of RPG's this is literally the BEST storyline I have come across, this is mainly why I have played for the past 6 hours without a break, lol, the storyline is just incredible. The characters are beautiful, I just have no cons to this game, 5 stars all the way!!!"", ""Great game but has game changing bug for my phone right now. I've been playing the game for about 4 years now and I absolutely love it, but there are some issues and everytime I press mail my game crashes.

Sometimes the dialogue is delayed, fooling me into restarting the game.', ""EXCELLENT but need improvements. I've played this game first bfr around 3 years ago and it was a bit boring but still fun. Now that I've come back, I see the game made TONS of improvements and I love it. It is not necessarily too easy to play and win. It needs strategy and enhancing so that's what made this game special. Altho, I would love if the packages here are cheaper rather than 5 packages and all of it is $99.99 which is very expensive and annoying. I can pay, but not too much at a time."", 'Game is way to confusing.im just plodding along trying to get the hang of it. It seems to be good. But waaaaay to many buttons to look for stuff.

I'm not sure if it's the UI design or the way the tutorial is structured, but it feels cluttered and overwhelming at times and half the time I don't even know what I'm doing as some game modes require some ridiculous high level parties to participate. Also unhelpful messages that say I haven't equipped blackaria whatever, a shortcut takes me to inventory but I can't find this missing equipment. Needs QOL improvements."", ""This game is probably the most new-player friendly gacha I have played. They make sure to give newbs everything we need to get up to speed with vets, jump in, and have a good time. Graphics, gameplay, and sound are all pretty solid so far. Story seems engaging and interesting. Tons of ways to earn currency. The various power-up systems seem overwhelming at first, but after quick (and mostly optional tutorials, that you are massively rewarded for completing) it's all fairly straightforward. 10/10"", ""I believe the game explains everything too fast. For example, there is very little information when the Allies are introduced, and we don't know what to do with all the rewards we get after the first battle (login reward+event reward+battle reward) - and there is too much emphasis on this loot while we actually give no importance to it, as we don't know what they are. Graphics are very nice and the plot is interesting though. I suggest some visual info to explain smoothly the importance of Allie"", 'Beautifully crafted, confusing UI, fun and distinct art style give this game charm. Except the UI part. Throwing everything at new first time login players is bad! Nothing to indicate which event / activity are new players friendly / recommended for. But once you got pass the UI, it a beautifully crafted game (graphically;).', 'I hope they create features where you can bulk sell heroes, apparently i have 160s same S rank hero that I dont need but it feels troublesome to tap 160s times of delete and confirm delete buttons each, since the auto pets feature doesnt function if theres no more higher rank heroes to be enhanced.', 'It is beautiful, the art is just stunning.

Dungeon Quest,com.shinybox.smash,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.shinybox.smash&hl=en&gl=us,"New Features:
Graphics Overhaul/Enhancements  - We have added several levels of graphical additions to Dungeon Quest. Dynamic Shadows have been added to all areas. Players have full control over the quality of the shadows through the options menu.

Legend and Eternal Legend Crafting - Our new Legend Crafting System allows you to Salvage your unwanted Legend and above items in return for Crafting Dust. If you have already unlocked a Legend item, you can now navigate to the LegendEx and create it for Dust. If you haven't unlocked the item, you'll be able to unlock creation of the Legend item with Dust! This provides a new way to target the Legend items you want while not being a slave to random chance.

Eternal Item Codex Tracking - Not only will you be able to create Legends item from the LegendEx in Patch 3.0, you'll also be able to create Eternal Legends from the brand new Eternal Tracking Section of the Codex.

Pet Crafting System - To facilitate customizing your pets a bit more, we've enabled the Diamond through Fluorite and Topaz crystals on Pets. The only difference is that these Crystals will consume 5 of each type instead of the usual 1 crystal.

Bug Fixes and System Adjustments:

Stat Change and Reset - Having near 300 stat points was always a bit tedious to assign and respec, so we've cut down the amount of stat points you gain per level from 3 to 1, and have tripled the effectiveness of each Stat. We've also improved the speed a bit of stat assigning.

Better Gold Purchase Value
THANK YOU for supporting Dungeon Quest and for helping us make even better games! With recent economy changes and improvement in past patches, the gold purchase had become unfortunately outdated. Each purchase now yields 100 TIMES the amount of gold as they did before!

The #1 reason why im giving two stars is because there is an ad that pops up in the upper right corner CONSTANTLY in the middle of gameplay, which completely ruins the immersion of gameplay for me. An ad inbetween levels is fine for me, but one that constantly pops up is unacceptable. Until that upper right ad BS is removed, im never playing this game again.', ""Pretty okay app!

I would also want to have multiplayer mode & some new maps"", ""Great. This game is awesome, and it really passed the time when I'm bored. I do, however, find it disappointing how you can only choose between the Wizard, the Knight, and the Archer. It would be cool if you could make the characters boy and girl, and make it possible to customise the character to make it look like you.

Seems a bit stingy on currency, but since there isn't a separate premium currency I guess it sorta makes sense. Also, since it's promoted as a game that can be played offline, it would be great if the user could choose when to save the game, instead of it automatically trying to save constantly, it interrupts game flow."", 'It\'s a great game. The experience I gain everytime I log in is always out of my ""worry world"". What I really love about it is the daily quest that would reward me with some coins. Unlike most games that would only give the option to purchase the in-game coins. Not that I can\'t buy the coins, but the dollar price is expensive for the coins in my country.

Creos look awesome, the element/evolution system is pretty good though I prefer the standard evolution mechanics that we're used to, I like the addition of healing moves and replacing pp with cooldowns and it doesn't force MTs down your throat. It has a few issues imo though. The ability bar looks old and out of place, only having 5 Creo with you at a time, the map is too small, the game is waaay too easy and it relies on status effects too much."", ""Could be fun but sadly ruined by greed/ gacha mechanics and some odd design choices.

I am no longer able to play it on the big screen (no Android TV controller support) but the touch controls are easy to use on my phone. That's the 10k foot view from a dad. From my 11yo, she absolutely adores this game. She's a self-proclaimed Pokemon expert and I often find her coming back to EvoCreo as it does a number of things really well. First, the ability to see the strengths and weaknesses of each type simply by tapping on the Creo type while in battle. She finds that super useful. Second, she loves the variety of Creo. Third, the story is good and she feels like there's more to it than simply trying to become a champion. For me, the dad, I'd love to be able to play this on my tv again. It really is a wonderful game and we've enjoyed many many hours of playing it. Keep up the good work Ilmfinity and we're looking forward to EvoCreo 2!"", ""I've been looking for an alternative to Pokemon and a lot of the games out there on mobile advertise themselves as being similar but are actually pay to win. Evocreo is a full game with gameplay very similar to Pokemon. In some ways the mechanics are better. You can get healing moves like in standard JRPGs which make a massive difference and moves have to recharge so you can't spam the most powerful move. Overall it's a brilliant game with really creative monsters and mechanics."", 'I saw the trailer, looked interesting. So I paid the reasonable price, was hyped about the game. Played for 10 mins which turned into 3 hours later. This game is simple, addicting and beautifully done. Will definitely have to buy the extension packages.', ""Well, I really like! Tbh I prefer it over most Pokemon games. A lot of creo designs are really pretty and nifty looking as well, like Valnot and Furen. The world feels p full, not like how it is in BotW where everyone had a motive and life, but it still felt nice to read dialogue that made sense and was placed well. For improvement, I would suggested adding more. Add somethings for those of us who don't care about battles. Like maybe a pagent for creo? Or perhaps camping and things like that."", ""I love the game. I realy like the battle scenario when there's a different moves that can be used for each creo, so one creo will not use all its slot moves with all powerfull moves. It make the battle more exciting because u dont need to expect a creo use a powerfull moves constinously. I also love the storyline, i didnt expect the ending. Hope double battle will be add to Evocreo 2 and with more awesome storyline. Great job"", 'Honestly this is the best mobile game I have ever come across.Really does scratch that pokemon itch, no comparision..I would even go as far as sayin it beats the modern pokemon games on ""monster"" designs.. hands down..absolutly brilliant game, hours of content...My only gripe would be this, I am doing a second play through on a different phone than the first, and for this second playthrough, I keep getting game freezes, where i have to reload the game and loose all progress since my last save..', ""This is a great game! It isn't easy peasy like some other turn based monster games and has cool mechanics and I love how the game looks and artwork of the creo. This is by far the best monster turn based game. I can't wait for evocreo 2 as they said will come out in a year or two."", ""I usually don't buy apps and games, but having tried the lite version, I was really impressed. This game is way better than Pokemon. The sprites, music, battle system were excellent. Wish if the game was a bit longer. I'm looking forward to play evocreo 2, when it gets released."", ""Tbh, probably the best Pokemon fan type game I've played though the thing with Google + being shut down doesn't let multiplayer work or even other saves. Probably should use other accounts such as Facebook or Instagram if possible. Sadly I wish I could play with my friends for I love this game"", 'This is an excellent game, whilst it does have slight bugs, its much better than pokemon in terms of designs of the creo and the types and battling mechanics. However one thing I would like to see in the new games is similar to something that is in pokemon SwSh where there is a wild area, not like the park but with different areas of snow desert, furthermore more developed towns like the final city in Evocreo. I love the inclusion of the creo that can evolve into many different types like naja.', ""Only issue I'm having is accessing the storage for my creos it just goes to a black screen and I can still here the music playing in the background other than that issue it's a wonderful game to play with the graphics and controls if the issue gets fixed I'd give it 5*"", 'For me i gave it a 4-star because the game is really beautiful and all but the in app purchase is a bit expensive i really really love the animation and for me it surpasses the GBA pokemon Games because the story is long and understanding so that is it', ""The game are very addicting but after finishing the game you will get bored because your enemies are still the same and also when you're catching creos. The man in Hydro City is right. Wish you'll add something special to the game."", 'Honestly, i thought this was another fake pokemon game. but it blew me away. the game is better than Pokemon, with vast Creo, prestige and more...... and it was just a dollar. best game I bought, keep it up imfilmity. and i want to see this on Switch i would buy it no matter the cost. u guys rock keep making the game better we all love it u guys. dont listen to haters 😜😜😃😃😀😀🤗🤗💪💪', ""Love this game. Have played through and beat it before and was wanting to play through again before the second game comes out. Just as great as I remembered only issue I am having is when I open the Creopedia my screen goes black. The music still plays but it won't let me do anything and I have to reset the game. Now I can manage to play the game without having to look in the Creopedia, and there is a creopedia online so not huge problem. But I'm on an LG Style 3 if you wanna look into it."", 'The best adventure, capture and battle monster game. The graphic and animation are awesome! But only one thing which is multiplayer, if it fixed I will give 5 stars. Overall its a very amazing and fun game to play ^_^', ""It's very similar to a pokemon game and it's pretty fun.It can be very addictive.It doesn't need much space and you can even play offline.It's totally worth spending some cash on it.If you don't like this game it's because it's not your type not because it's bad."", 'This game doesnt get old to me no matter how many times I play. I beat it for the first time the other day and its still fun but...now I wish the adventure didnt have to end. I have the dlc wit the extra Alphite story..but even thats not enough. Give this more updates at a time and add maps and Creo..make it live on!! Not a lot play still but I do, hoping some sort of hype hits this game soon. Anyway. Great game overall and still love it.', 'It really is a great game. I love that you have so many creatures to choose from! Its a really great game that at first seems like a rip off of Pokemon, but it really is just that same form of game rather than a blatant recreation. The mechanics are similar only in the form of rpg it is, even then only in battle, but other than that its entirely independent and unique! 10/10, would play again!', ""This is one of the best games I've ever played! Some additions though, would be amazing: -More quests. After I beat the colosseum, it was pretty boring. -More moves, abilities, and traits to the creo. Once you've unlocked all the moves, its just the exact same moves. For some creo, they aren't even that good. -A multiplayer setting! -The option to have more than one game slot. Thank you, though, ilmfinity, for this great game!"", ""This game is very good. Definitely way better then Pokemon. I love how there are a lot of features and tactics you can use. I'll for sure get evocreo 2 when it comes out."", ""I would rate 5 stars, but the game doesn't load, only showing a black screen. The game used to be amazing and I loved the story. Please dix the bug asap. Edit: The game loads now and I love it. Just seeing the variety of creo and NPC's is amazing. Although I would love to see more quests, creo, fights, and areas added to the game."", 'THANK YOU SOOO MUCH DEVS FOR FIXING THE BLACK SCREEN! I APPRECIATE YOUR EFFORTS SO MUCH! I don\'t experience the black screen anymore ^^ edit: Hello ilmfinity! sorry for bugging you devs again, but I have another problem. While using the game, I clicked on ""creopedia"" and then the screen turned black. I Constantly restarted the game, it didn\'t work. I couldn\'t use my creopedia anymore. Sorry if it\'s another black screen problem, haha. Again, I\'ll appreciate it if you all can help! <3', 'Really fun. Quite unique take and very unique attacks. And the difficulty is pretty high which keeps me very interested.', 'I actually really like this game, mainly due to how it differentiates from pokemon. The mechanic of evolutions based on the elements used is great and it seems you all tried hard on this. The designs are also consistent across the board with only one I didnt like much. I have a good feeling about the sequel and I hope it will be great. :D', ""I'm not sure about this game. I played the free demo and I was intrigued enough to buy the full version, but I don't know... Battles get kind of repetitive after a while and there's just not that same incentive to explore the map as other similar games... It just... It feels kind of dull after a few hours of playing."", ""I absolutely love this games,I think it's great,it could improve on the story a bit and you finish to quickly but overall it's a good game,part 2 really sucks tho"", ""This game is very very fun to play if anybody has free time. Me personally I enjoy every minute that I play the game. Can't wait until the Creator's come out with something new for the game."", ""I just wanna recommend adding more ways to earn prime gemmas like daily login or smthng.. I really love playin the game and I still play it even though I have completed the game. It would also be good if there are more ways to enjoy the game like battle tent or something.. The only thing I do now is farm for shinies and genetically modify creos and it get boring on the long run. Btw I'm not complaining, I do enjoy the game thats all"", ""It's a super fun game and I've honestly enjoy playing it. I am however having an issue where when I try and open the Creopedia, my entire screen just goes black and I can't go back to my game, even though the music is still playing. I really hope they can fix this issue..."", 'This game is great and really fun. It is also really calming to play and it is well made. I love all the Creo and over all it is great to play!', 'Disappointed. The game freeze when i want to meet the mom and i cant pick-up any gem. Moreover i cant sync the account with my google. I already play free version of the game in the past. I decided to buy the pro ver and i got a big expectation. Sadly, so many bugs and i cant play multiplay. Will play again if these bugs are fixed', ""I personally really love this game. I find it fun and it's definitely worth the price, but the only reason it's not getting 4 stars is an issue I have when using the creopedia. Everytime i try to open it I get a black screen that doesn't seem to go away."", ""I really enjoy this game the only problem I have is that it tends to freeze every so often. Not sure if it's just my phone or what"", 'This game is fun to play! So much creo to find and places to visit. The design of the creos, the battle mechanic is unique. After the latest updates, everything work smoothly! Overall, I love this game.Thank you for the hard work!', 'The game is really great but, whenever I tap the creopedia option my screen would be all black. I tried tapping the others in the options and it works fine. I also tried clearing my cache and restarting my device but it keeps happening. Pls fix this problem...']"

But the huge downside for me is the download of the game. Thie size of the download from the AppStore is something like ~ 71 MB. No problem. After starting the game it says it needs to download another ~ 1170 MB. Sure, go for it. But that second download will take hours if not days. I (re) downloaded the game yesterday. My WiFi was and is perfectly fine and I was not running any other apps on my tablet during the download. The game download gets stuck at around 10%. Every restart of the game nets me another ~3% of the download bar. so after 30-something restarts the download is finally finished. Took me hours to get to here. I start the game, want to spend some energy on World Boss - Game crashes. Restart and try again, same thing. So today I tried World Boss again, game keeps crashing! Okay, time to redownload the game.. AGAIN! And guess what, the download gets stuck AGAIN. Honestly, the game is fun. It really is. But this downloading fiasco is the worst I have ever witnessed.', 'It is a very nice and very addictive game on the downside however, if you do get a high lvl and acquire desirable summons hackers seem to be attracted. If you get hacked no real support to recover your account unless you keep track of money you spent on it ( if you did) my account got hacked 2 times should have learned my lesson after the first one', ""Good graphics, fun gameplay, clean and simple UI, no obtuse or confusing character progression/upgrade systems and many different units to play...If you can get them. Which leads to this games major problem: The 'Gacha' (the chance to obtain stronger, rarer characters or equipment) is truly awful, scam level in fact and among the worst of all gachas in that regard. Add onto this the constant pop-ups aggressively pushing absurdly over-priced packages and I can't in good conscience recommend this."", ""I really do love this game. Sometimes I find myself getting wayyy to sucked in and have to force myself away from the grind. I do have one wish tho. Another element type for Monsters. A green Earth type would be nice. We have Water, Fire, Wind, Light and Dark. You could even make it brown! There's so much potential with a new element type. New mons, new bosses, who knows...maybe even new runes. Please take this into consideration 🙏"", ""I've been playing daily since 2014, I had only 1 year pause from the game so that's still a lot of time active in the game. Despise me summoning so many light and dark scrolls in all this year's, I still didn't get any L&D Nat 5 however my husband that used to play, for a very long time, way less than me, he has one for over an year now.

I'm using my hive account and i wasn't notified about any maintenances or what.. please send support. -sincerely, a summoner war veteran returnee Edit: i play in asia server and my account was created a month before the update and it was fine not until the update. BIG EDIT: I've found a solution for this problem. Simply delete 5 of your friends and go in a quiet channel."", 'Very very free-to-play friendly. One of, if not the best turn based mobile RPGs on the market. Very well established, tons of content to explore. There is always something to do. People who spend might get an upper hand in the Competitive Scene, but it is still possible to be strong and thrive without spending a single penny. Well crafted and the devs are very in with the community on a consistent basis.', 'Been playing for yrs, i love the game but things could be better, like having another tower for the people thats been playing for years so we can update our stats. Game takes up so much room on my phone. The games addicted. But i spend money and love the game. Wish we would get more things for free more often.', 'In my opinion,since we all have different thoughts,its a great game! Lots of characters to choose from,unique designs for each character,and great battle mechanics. For whoever is reading this,the game is easier if you can understand each monster you have and how their attacks have different effects. Synergy is key!', ""Excellent game once you get used to it. Don't, please don't, for the love of all thats good, don't compare yourself when starting this game to the players who have been playing for years. Competitive free to play, IF and only IF you are playing consistently. Don't expect free to play to be competitive if you only play 5-10 min a day. Awesome game otherwise. Been playing little over a month and highly recommended this game. Just keep your charge cable on standby..."", 'I love the game and been playing it since I was 7 and I am13 now but it been rlly hard for me to get good scrolls and better monster for my self. The only way to get good scrolls is if u buy them with money and as a teen like me and i dont have money like that to be buying 100 dollar bundles. So i feel like they should add more quest to get better scrolls and ruins. And keep adding events and updates. This is a very good game and I enjoy the grind but i just cant get good scrolls.', ""This game is truly incredible. There are so many things to do, you can play for hours on end. The auto battle feature make it perfect for when you're semi involved in a project of one kind or another. You can quite literally grow stronger, level up, and farm with a couple taps of the screen. On the other hand, there's a ton of engaging and challenging content for when you can give it your full attention. The fully customizable monster based gameplay allows for thousands of different strategies!"", 'This Game is so good. It will teach how to grind to do better to best and it will also teach how to be patient all the times and be responsible, in such a way on how you will spend energy and mana stone. Its not just a game their is deeper on it. Dont just stick on what you have grind more to be better at the game just like in life grind and grind until you succeed. More events to come. Thank you', 'This game has its ups and downs. The PVE based content in the game is very easy to clear once you invest time into it. Competitive is the endgame for players, and has 3 forms. Arena is ai based pvp, its broken for a long time now, everyone basically runs the same defence. Guild content is balanced, boring, but the rewards are great. RTA is real time pvp. This is THE endgame, since its the only true competitive mode. The rewards are mostly cosmetics though. As for Summoning rates... they suck', 'Great overall theres plenty of content. Suited for any type of gamer you are. Also can easily rank up in the game over time legit . No need to buy /play to win to still be competitive. 5*Community(worldwide) thats eager to help new players. Highly recommend you to start downloading! Very strat and stat orientated and can be quite the intellectuals game. Happy summoning', ""Good game. But im leaving 2 star review. The developers have left out auto farming when every other game offers it now. They don't care about your quality of life, and want you glued to their game 24/7. Moving on to calibria where there is an auto farm feature. Value my time com2us or i won't value your game."", 'I became unhealthily addicted to it, I enjoyed last fun moment today and now I declare quitting the game, I wanted transmorifigation but RTA is too tough and takes too long, also 6* monsters is hard to the point of making me lose focus of my old job, (that old job one of co workers introduce me to this game), please make it less addictive. Now I quit, I hope this is a lesson for everyone.', 'I do like this game and I want to give it more stars, but in the world arena (good will battle) I will accept an invitation for a battle and then it will say Error you will be brought to the tittle screen and then it makes me reload the whole game. I am quite annoyed and frustrated by this, so that is why it gets 3 stars for me.', ""Playing this game since beta and I've watched monster and rune drops go to an all time low it's very repetitive to get either a decent monster or runes for them...if they put a repeat button in for dungeons it wouldbe worth grinding but every single time having yo hit the button again makes for a long dragged out process that has a good possibility of not even getting anything of worth."", 'My favourite phone game. I love the variety of monsters and working out what teams work, often 3* are worth training up, not just super rare 5*s, and most 4* monsters are worth keeping. This game is pretty light on the power used to run it, updates regularly and love it enough to play on two devices. However, it keeps crashing on my tablet - which is a Huawei MediaPad T5.', 'Og player here This is the most time consuming game i ever see even if some parts can go in auto. The rune upgrading system is designed for make you upset. Not free to play at all. Highly depends rng whats make you do insane in the long run. And here i am playing this shity ass game for 4 yearhs now but why? Someone just end ny suffering at this point. Pls dont play this :(', ""Great game. You can really play however you want, but of course there's one way that let's you progress faster. People need to stop complaining about droprates because plenty of very good monsters are free, farmable, and really help you in every area of the game. Edit: contacted com2us. Crashing has been fixed. The new transmogs are nice, but please make the event end at some point so it's actually special to have them. Some monsters recieve lower stats upon awakening. Please fix this."", 'Hello com2us in need of help here. The game have a problem with me after 15 days of playing. The scenario and cairos won\'t open for me. It force closes and wastes my energy. I have already deleted the app but it\'s just the same, forces itself. A message flashes itself, it says something about a ""debugger attached"".', 'I love this game but the new update with the world arena rune is sooo dumb its just a wast money any time i want to fight my friends. For example: I would get a new rune i would like to put on my monster, so i did then time to go and fight my friends it is not on the monster and i have to put it on again and have to remove the rune i had on before with money and it is very very Annoying!!!!!! And a wast of my gems', 'Summoning sucks. I went threw over 30 mystical schrolls and a legendary schroll and only got 2 4* monsters. Wouldnt be such a bad thing except the mystical schrolls keep giving me 3* monsters that ive already summoned over and over again. I would say that maybe im unlucky but ive reset my account numourous times to find out if this was the norm and turns out it is. Overall i think this game is all about making money and they want u to spend that money in order to gain 4* or 5* monsters', ""Latest update to the old arena wrecked it. Now if some troll wants to lose on purpose 20 times my history is full of successful defences that I can't fight back and earn glory point. My arena rank is then too high for me to fight and beat anyone so my only option is to pick a few players to fight and lose making them have the same problem. This game keeps sliding down hill. Also I will not be getting the sequel to this game unless everything from this one transfers. Events still are broken too"", ""The game is a scam. Played for 5 year's to get to lvl 50 and get my first nat 5 star. Really don't recommend this game unless you have thousands of dollars to spend for nothing. Come2us is a greedy com that only care how much money they can get with the least amount of effort. Hope you give it 1star review cause that's what it's worth."", 'Everytime i click something a pop up shows up. All the new content and monsters that have been added are purely for meta cash and time wasters. for instance they installed a component to craft runes, the component drops in the same location the item it crafts into drops. on top of that you get one reward for 8 energy and 90 max energy. they added a lot of new content but you spend so much time grinding runes you have no energy for said content. which is a shame, game could have be fun.', ""Used to love game 5 stars only because people need to know if your not going to spend hundreds and thousands of $$$$ don't even download. They may have made it easyer to get scrolls witch I s what u use to obtain units they'd rates are so so low don't even want to no the light dark rates it's 50$ for 1 scrolls and u only have a 1_16 chance for a 4or 5* unit. I love the game have played 1 account since 2013 and have summoned 6 Nat 5s the rest are fusion. And only have like 450/1200 units"", ""It has been an amazing game so far have had lots of fun playing it. I have ran into a problem with the game it will open normally and do it's loading stuff and when it gets to where it says ready to start I press the screen and the game closes itself."", 'Hello com2us. I aappreciate your efforts for better arena experience but I have a problem in my runes. The problem is when I changed and fixed my runes in my monster storage it went through but when I entered world arena it did not change or update at all. Please check it com2us and I love your game.', ""Great game been playing for years. Always new things to do, and feels great to play even if you don't spend much time playing. Events are fun and plentiful. Would recommend and have to my friends. If you play make sure you invite friends in game rather than just tell them like I did.😃"", ""Getting boring. It's a really really good addictive game you won't regret playing for sure and I've actually spent money on it. But i haven't had a nat 5 in about 6 months now. I just want some new monsters to play with. I've started to look for a new game to play because im getting bored :("", ""Lovely graphics and visuals, and the gameplay was simple but masterfully addicting. Not much to do post-story, but it's definitely still worth keeping. Social levers were built into the platform so as not to be a distraction, but isn't just a waste of space either. 111% recommend."", ""This is a strategic rpg game with complex characters and gameplay designed to test your wits. It's a lot of fun and anyone can be a top player. Plus there are always events that grant you exclusive rewards so there's never a dull moment."", 'A good game for both f2p and p2p. The game is very newbie friendly and the ongoing events is pretty luxurious for players. However, only the summon rates and drop rates bottleneck the rest of the game specialty. The rate of getting good unit and good runes is quite low, which requires too much time and effort investment.', ""The game is wonderful and it has God like characters and runes, but the time it took to download and update it took 2 days. I really like it, it's just I had deleted the game twice because either an update was available but I couldn't, or I needed space. Either way I love the game. 😃😃😃"", ""It was a nice game but after 5 years of playing and still i don't have Light And Dark Natural 5 star monster.. com2us always giving you a hope in every event but still always Nat 3 star monster.. you can get LnD Nat 5 monster if you purchase to them..so for me its ok hehe..if i don't have money to buy the packages hehe.. but still THANK YOU COM2US because i found some good friends in my journey of playing this game..keep up the good job..GOD BLESS"", 'This was a ok game but now i cant play i have perfect connection running at 60mbps and every time i load this game it goes to a black screen for 5 mins then sais network cannot be found not the first issue iv had with the game either overall a great game when it works tho. The biggest issue with this game by far is its storage space and the fact that you cant move it to sd card especially with thousands of texture files.', ""This game sux. It can't remember passwords.

And it's almost impossible to get a good monter without the spending."", 'This game is VERY GOOD. I started playing i think about 2016. I quit and started playing again in 2020. One thing is that the game needs to be more active. I feel like nothing is really happening and game creators and developers are doing nothing to help revive the game. Also, add a new concept, just battling monsters feels a bit boring, dont it?Add variety. Some advertising is deserved for how well developed this game is. Dont just add new monsters and events.

So much content, team customization, can make for an endless experience. Reminiscent of classic ff titles, while keeping it fresh. Feedback: On the record sphere home screen, put a check mark on toons fully dived. Orb exchange, have a button to ""convert all orbs to major"". More organise categories, like sort magicite by passives like dampen or atk boon, or sort characters by SB type, or ability schools. Need a drop down menu tree to avoid so many load screens.', ""The game is literally unplayable on my phone, note 9.

This is unfortunate because I heard great things about this game and I was looking forward to it."", ""I want to play the game, saw my friend playing it looked awesome but when I downloaded I don't even have the bottom portion of the screen. I tried looking up fixes but there are none, wish this would get patched soon. For now one star is all I will give due to an inoperable game set up."", ""Pure FF bliss lol. Most people I know who read the comments don't trust they were posted by a User. Building my FFVII team in this game while patiently waiting for the ps4 remake to come out. Another bit, this game pretty much hurls champions at you for free lol"", ""I'm having a ton of fun, it may be me but understanding all that it is to get heroes, relics and all that had been a tad confusing. Other than that, I can't wait to get Sora!"", ""I've played this game for years, downloaded it again today to get back into it and the bottom part of the screen is missing!

I don't know if it's a Samsung Galaxy S9+ problem or what but please fix this..."", 'Great game. One suggestion though: another XIII focused relic draw.

I've been playing it for years and still love it. Its very free to play friendly. Most of the content you need the latest and greatest relics to beat ends up becoming permanent game content or recurring content, so if you can't beat it when it launches and don't want to spend money, no problem, just wait a few months and all the free pulls you get alongside slow and steady power creep as the game progresses will get you caught up! The nice thing about this game that makes it easy for new players to get into is all the current banners we can pull on offer up the newest and best relics available, so right from the start you have access to the same top tier relics veteran players do. There is no need to spend months or even years grinding away hopelessly trying to catch up to everyone else just because you weren't around since day 1."", ""I have been playing this game since it first became available years ago. It combines all of the final fantasy storylines into it's own unique story. The developers are great. All of your favorite characters are available. The pulls for equipment are generous and content is pretty steady. I just had an issue with my phone settings after a recent android update and after requesting help, they swiftly assisted me in adjusting my display settings to fix the issue. I highly recommend this game."", 'I was FULLY enjoying the game, but then suddenly, hours ago the game got stuck on a loading screen for a certain stage in the main story dungeon just before FFXV fifth door, I have already Uninstalled and Reinstalled it but it is still stuck there. please help me i have spent so much time on this game and im really in love with it.

Only dropping 1 star because; it has been entertaining, and I plan on grinding for the materials I need.', ""I really enjoy this game's gameplay mechanics and its retro style. The multiplayer system is also great, but you have to complete the first 4 Books of Trials. These things are so absurdly tedious to beat since you have to play 15+ levels every time, and it gets annoying if you just want to play Multiplayer.""]"
