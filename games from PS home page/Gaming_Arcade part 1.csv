Numerous bug fixes","[""THE NEW 40TH ANNIVERSARY INTERFACE IS UGLY! Please bring the interface back to the old version. The interface of the mazes menu (relaxed, challenging, and elite) to select any mazes I want to play is totally awful! The mazes grid view dissapeared and changed to scroll side-by-side, which make me frustrated cause I have to scroll them one by one to choose, and there are no crown icons on each thumbnails so I can't notice which mazes I've completed or not. Better make a grid view like the old one."", ""Every version update gets worse and more commercial. Now there are more commercials than ever and constant pressure to watch more apps. Has become very invasive and ruined a good game. I'll have to give up on this game. Tried it again with new update. Now it's even worse. Only three tournament credits at s time? You can't even play one round of all 3 tournaments! Who's lousy idea was that? And try not to be juvenile and patronizing in your responses. You've ruined a great app."", ""Great game. However, after the update it won't you to collect the coins after completing a mission. The old missions just sit there"", ""Love the new UI!

I'd 100 percent buy them if you did!"", ""I really like this game but man.. it's sooo frustrating!!!! The amount of times it has crashed, it just keeps circling & I have to restart! Ruins the flow.. all I wana do is play? So annoying coz I really like the game."", 'This game sucks when the ghost get close in pursuit the Pacman tends to turn around on its own accord or just quit working altogether I thought it was me at first but when the pursuit is hot the game has a flaw even the direction arrow will be facing the way you had directed although Pacman just turns on its own and usually directly toward the ghost', 'I really like playing this Pac-Man game and playing all of the difference stages make the Pac-Man game really interesting and fun for me.', ""It's fun but needs fixing game makes Pacman die making him change direction so player does not see his or her potential to get much further and to Garner more game play points."", ""Could have been worse, but it doesn't actually have original pac man in it at all, just a reasonable facsimile with alot of unique mazes"", ""Pretty cool game but it would be and awesome game if pac-man would keep going the way that I try to move him, he even sometimes turned on his own! And when I win it will ask if I want to watch a video to double my points and I don't know y because it just says no current offers available and it's the same thing when I try to get more points, but it makes u watch 5 seconds of a video and give nothing for it! That's bulls**t if they aren't going to let me willingly watch any videos y offer?!?!"", ""Game play needs a little improvement controls are slightly erratic at times, if you are going to offer commercialized game play then you need to have something to offer or don't on my phone it just doesn't seem to work ever. That's a Motorola G7 power! I play everyday and I love this game, ever since it came out back in the 80s and no I don't miss the old Joystick controller!!!"", ""This is a great game but I already had the game for more than 2 years and purchase more points to play more levels. And just today I wanted to play my game and the program wouldn't allow me to play so I had to uninstall the game and once I installed the game again this time I lost all the points I had from my purchase. I had 250 points. If you can please give me my points so I can play my levels again that would be a nice thing to do. It's not my fault that the game crashed. Please respond!!"", 'This application gave me the classic maze for free when I download the only version on Google play games which was free which is socool. However, when I bought the premium version on my iPad and it worked well for more than a year but then dispite the fact that my iPad was convicted to a network which I know for a fact that internet was available decided to stop conecting to the internet.

Same games every day!! And I can't watch an ad to increase my rewards on regular games or daily rewards, says not available, but then an ad pops up when I try to change screens. Really???"", ""Great game orginally but this version has to many bugs the power pellets either don't last or work at all so there's no chomping ghost's for points and the ghost's are faster than Pac-man able to run him down even after he's already evaded them guaranteeing you die no matter how good you are at this game..this needs to be fixed immediately or we all need our money refunded...these obvious problems are what's keeping this all-time classic from being an easy automatic 5 star rating."", 'This game ate my battery faster then pacman could eat the dots. this game is extremely heavy on the battery and is laggy if you dont have a high end phone, during the lag (or just randomly i really dont know) the game will take away your control to let you get killed off by a ghost, the control loss can take from 1 second all the way up to 10. i suggest that if you dont have an extremely expensive phone and you dont use your phone for playing games more then for calls, then do not get this game.', ""Always nags to play an ad to claim rewards or continue to play when you are out of lives, but the app comes back saying that there are no active campaigns to choose from yet plays ads on existing game. Thanks for nothing, you're welcome for a single star. Would prefer 0 stars bug google won't all it. (Typical bs)"", 'It used to be a five star game but play time has drastically gone down because of advertisements. There seems to be plenty of commercials until you hit boost or attempt to get more charges to play the tornament. Then if you win the tornament you dont get the prize coins anyway.', ""Soooo,this game is quite good but the only thing is it keeps on crashing and stopping.Once , all of the pellets,ghosts and pacman disapeared leaving only the map and me trying to understand what happened.I wasn't even able to complete one stage without the game crashing...so it leaves me with 2 stars"", ""Brings back memories, when there were places full of video machines that we'd spend hrs there playing as kids. So fun"", 'I still like the game alot but l can only ply two rounds of one game then l have to ""close all"" and tap the app for pac man and start all over again. I have to do this over and over again to be able to play the game, or just not play. Can you remedy this problem? Thank you.', 'My question is this, How are we supposed to get free coins if the videos are NEVER AVAILABLE so basically your just gonna dysfunction that so we have to use money to buy coins. This is a great game but how it is ran by the app owners is not right.', ""Great Game, Awesome..... but please fix the bug. It's been hours since I haven't been able to open the game. FYI - every other game is opening except Pac-man."", '*sigh* why did you take away two challange staminas and double the refresh time? Do you want me to play the game less?

EDIT: Ok, so after a long time playing I can say that it's repetitive, not that is bad, but the first time you play it'll be the last time you'll play it in term of gameplay and what's changed. Oh yeah, and Limited Time Events that while some come back many don't, and that'll hurt the score to me..."", 'I\'m gonna give my honest opinion of Sonic Dash... I do really love it, and can see how it\'s improved over time. However, with good comes a little bad, and the bad being that you can\'t unlock other characters, unless you collect enough animals to finish building separate ""zones"" for each character. However, I do love how many characters are available in this game, so that small inconvenience is forgiven. However, it\'s still annoying.', ""I was surprised to find out that this game was still being work on. While the core gameplay is mostly the same, it gives you a lot more to work with now with the included environment building (as i call it at least) and events featuring new characters and locations. I'm honestly glad that I redownloaded this game after 3 years"", ""When the game works, isn't showing ads after you die or killing you with cheap traps, it's a fun game that can feel a bit grindy. HOWEVER, the game constantly hiccups causing missed inputs, falling through the floor after making a jump, deaths after dodging a obstacle & breaking loop sequences (Camera gets stuck at end of loop). I rarely play this with an internet connection as its the only way to prevent ads from playing after death & there doesn't seem to be a way to stop them."", ""It's pretty basic so far, but challenging, and nostalgic enough to keep me going for now. I'm sad that I'm coming in at the very end of the baby sonic event and won't be able to get him, but the character selection is okay, definitely most of the main cast, but not as varied in the sonic universe as I'd like. All in all, okay. You guys made a passable runner, well done."", 'I absolutely love this game if its offline. I love the online part of it also, the perks of being online makes it so much more fun than when its offline. What kills the idea of me ever going online through this game is the ad pop ups slow down the game so back it causes my game to freeze. This game works so much better offline. Other than the bugs, i love this game.', 'This game is really fun, better than the old version. Its graphics are amazing, the boss is really challenging for players who want hard mode. My most favourite thing about this game is that you can save pets and give them a home. I really enjoy this game and hope I never have to leave it', 'I remember why I unistalled it now. I go back, and after being forced to play the tutorial, I encounter a glitch -- this is literally like maybe two minutes in. It darkens the screen so you HAVE to hit whatever button they\'re so adamant on getting you to tap on, but when you do it\'s like, ""You have to go to this area first"". Um, okay, but how when everything else is greyed out, and I literally can\'t? Lol, I downloaded the game with intentions to play it, just to uninstall it 3 minutes later...', 'Some obstacles are almost impossible to avoid. At one point I was on the lefthand side (to avoid the two tall obstacles to my right) with another two tall obstacles in front of me and I swiped right twice to avoid them but still collided with the middle one. What puzzles me is that both swipes must have been registered as I heard the swipe sound twice. Either this is a bug or the game is creating obstacles that may not be humanly possible to avoid. Camera angles make this even more difficult.', ""This is a great runner game for anyone who enjoyed subway surfers or temple run. In the beginning when it first came out, it felt like a serious cash grab as everyone in the game was rediculously expensive. But, it's recent updates have really improved it, as most characters can be warned over time. The courses with original music are pretty sick too! Great job on this one, Sega!"", 'I love this game so much! I played it years ago but had to delete it because i needed space.This game has chaned so much! Althi wonder why you cant buy certain characters, its amazing! Although i would like it if you maybe brought down the prices of silver and those ones for the ring thingys because its almot impossible to get that many red rings without buying.', ""It's a fairly standard auto-runner/Temple Run clone but this time it actually fits the property like a glove. Very addictive but in a good way. Has a strong Sonic feel. Where it loses a star is for some characters locked behind a paywall and the graphics have been updated to resemble the movie more than classic Sonic. This leaves Robotnik and the Badniks looking a bit boring. Hope it's only temporary while the film is out."", ""Probably one of the most addicting endless runners out there, sometimes I feel like the controls are not responsive? The level design can feel cheap in lot of places, and I'm bit disappointed that Green Hill is not based on the Green Hill from Generations, but Sky Sanctuary is. Otherwise it's a good time waster with our favorite blue blur"", 'wow. just wow. a decent running game, which would be a perfect fit with old school sonic and you ruin it by bloating it with as much advertising as you could. title page? adverts for the movie (sure why not). play a game? popups and adverts afterwards. and random ones that pop up just because. uninstalled because it wasted my time and broke my heart.', ""Wow got baby Sonic a new one. So still moving on. Love to play,Didn't realize there were that many. So fun to play . Fun to play. I just keep going .Been playing for a long time!!!!! Yeah level 49 now. Guess it looks like this is the last level and got all the characters stared out so just playing to be playing. Lots of fun.Still going strong and fun to play."", 'This Game is A great game. A variety characters to unlock and event happen often. but I have a few things I want to be improve. First of all, the animations of character, please put more animations in,maybe some voice clips,different sfx for each character and please give unique expressions and animations to different members of the cast. Ideas= Silver gains his Phycokenetic Powers when dashing and glows cyan,Shadow activates Chaos Control turns red like in his own game Hedghog and Sonic 2006.', ""Very fun game and it is addicting. To be honest i didn't think i would like it because i really not that big into endless runners but ya this and as well as sonic forces( that was the game that hot me to try this one) are highly fun . my only gripe and ya i knownit it is to keep us playing but 500 token for teen sonic from the new movie is a little high"", 'This is pretty darn good game! I do have my complaints, though, like not being able to get normal rings with just red star rings. In my opinion, in-app purchases should only be for premium currency (like red star rings) and bundles. Also, there should be another way to get gems besides achievements. Other than that, the game is really good!', ""This game is awesome but the only thing is that I want in the game is super sonic, no ads, and at least 1 hundred badges to collect baby sonic and movie sonic because then that will be awesome. It already took me 2 hours to get teen sonic and I know its gonna happen again with baby sonic because it always does and it's so hard. Still it's an awesome game and I really support the game because it is the best sonic runner game I have ever played..."", ""One of the best free to play games out there. They handle their optional payment methods well and I've gotten all the characters i want in the game 3 times over the years without paying anything. If you don't have the patience for grinding you can throw a few bucks in"", 'This is the best game that I have ever played when I was 5 till now! With all of these new events and new characters that keeps you wanting to play the game more!! Sonic has been a part of my life and I am very happy that Sega is working hard just to make us happy and have fun! Thank you Sega for being amazing!', 'I am personally really nostalgic for this game. But this game is just fantastic to play on the go. All of the new events for new characters always get me hyped about this game. I do feel like Sonic does belong in the endless runner type of games because it suits him, well lucky for you this is the game to play.', 'This brings back memories, to when I was 6, all the way to 12, this game still is addictive and beautiful, it lags a bit, probably because of the phone, but it still goes all out, creating dreams and fun for kids like me, thank you so much Sega, for all the loving memories you have given me.', ""The game is good, but it needs some more graphic update, for example on the new map they look kinda weird running, and the design it self of all the characters is kinda lacking, you can do way better, oh, and please, change Amy's running animation, it's truly awful, besides the graphics the game is great, please let's upgrade the graphics."", 'Have been playing this for such a long time and it just keeps getting better. You dont have to pay to have a better experience which is awesome. The missions are not impossible and the gameplay is smoothe. Alsoo seems like the new update fixed the espio glitch that i was having so 5 stars for you. Good game', 'This game is absolutely amazing!It has amazing graphics and characters,it runs smoothly on my device and the graphics are of course beautiful to look at. And i quite enjoyed playing it so my rating is 10 out of 10 and would definetly recommend.', ""It's basically a reskinned version of Temple Run at its core, but fits well to the Sonic theme because arguably Sonic's quick step mechanics were first. It's fun, and expansions to the content over the past year have made it compelling to return to. Restoring the habitats of Sonic's tiny friends is surprisingly enjoyable even if after the first 4 areas the requirements get pretty extreme."", 'This game is awesome. This is the best running game ever. The controll is easy the graphics is fine the game play is good. My fav character is Teen sonic,baby sonic and tails. Give em a cheer of this delightful game. You should add a sonic dash 3 and put all the characters like hipster sonic,tails,teen sonic,amy and more il give this game 5 stars. Cuz i luv sonic games but not sonic.exe it gives me nightmares everyday when i play it.', ""I played a lot of this game years ago, and dropped off because of the little variety. I've come back to see that it's much improved. More backgrounds, more characters, graphical update, and just enough added complexity to the controls. It's a solid and enjoyable time-filler."", ""It's good! This game is a old time favourite for me! But I wish they made it easier when I come to getting the characters, still I think every kid should play this! It's amazing! And adding that it's hard to jump up on multiple things."", ""I think it's a great game and a time killer but I feel it shouldn't make you wait for a missions time to run out the reason is because it's an endless runner its gonna be bland quickly even with the events and it would keep you more busy and make you wanna play more but great game. END"", ""I had re-downloaded this game today, and as soon as I got onto the title screen after loading it's loaded a hand pointing to the settings button, indicating for me to press. However, no matter how many times I press said button it is stuck. It's not taking me to settings and won't let me do anything else at all on the app. Really disappointed as I used to really enjoy this game"", 'Awesome game! Please optimize the game, it lags in offline mode and I dunno why. And the events are worth grinding especially, Sonic from the movie. The graphics is good, the obstacle is kinda hard, it has blind spot that you cant see if theres an obstacle.', ""This game is best because it's about you can you quit any characters on sonic dash to get sonic, tails, knuckles, Amy, classic sonic, metal sonic, and more but you can't get all characters by building animals home and beat the bosses is eggman from sonic dash, zazz from sonic lost world, and dr. Robotnik from sonic the hedgehog: 2020 because they just upgrade Sonic dash on January 31st 2020 to be teen sonic and baby sonic""]"

Highly recommend because in my opinion one of the best if not the best games series on mobile. Great developers. I've been playing sharkjira recently and i'm not sure if it is just sharkjira but it occasionaly stutters. Doesn't take away from the experience. A msterpiece that will change your view on sharks. Thanks FGOL and Ubisoft"", ""Edit- I lied, this game is actually terrible. I tried to use my mako shark but you guys are just money hungry and at 5:06 an electric shark comes out of nowhere and kills me, due to that I don't wanna waste gems so I have to watch an ad. This game is also HUGE pay to win. If you don't have enough money to spend they don't want ya. You being a pay to win makes people want to hack and even some people do hack such as myself starting tomorrow. Stop being so money hungry ubisoft.> ☆ < (One star)"", 'I like this game on my phone, but controlls do not work on my computer even though it breifed me on the controlls for my device. If you could fix this error it would be great. Another reason is whenever i play this game on my other devices there is always a bigger shark to eat me, and it takes forever to evolve for this reason. PLZ UPDATE.', ""It is a really fun game to play, I find it alot of fun when I'm just laying in bed at night playing this game. The only thing I wish for is a new map or multiple maps that you can be in that are not timed and that ate much larger than those portal ones. Other than that I find this game to be one of the few mobile games I play."", 'This game is great, I already played it a long time ago and glad to see that the game is still alive. However, I cannot give it a full 5 star due to the fact that, I have problems with how the cloud saving works because I saved my progress before I uninstalled the game and when I came back there is no load system and there was no room for me to continue my last progress and it forced me to go back from the start.. I hope you guys can fix this issue. Thanks for the game! 😇', ""I used to have this game a while back, and I loved it. Some things are new to the game since I had it. Right now, I'm on the Hammerhead shark. I think the prices for the sharks are reasonable so far, and I'm happy with all of the new sharks they added. The fact that you can't earn gems easily sucks. That's one of the reasons this game doesn't get five stars. Another is the fact that wherever you go, there's some crazy special shark that kills you immediately. Fix this, then I will rate 5 stars."", 'I think the game is great, has a lot of special sharks and even sea monsters including The Abyss shark. But since there is a Godzilla Shark, How about a Reaper Leviathan!! My two favorite ocean games is Hungry shark and Subnautica and I thought it would be cool if you added The Reaper Leviathan to the game! I would be amazed and extremely happy including other players if you added the Reaper Leviathan. But still a great game', ""I like this game, I love the sharks...but with that zombie shark, it's practically impossible playing! Seriously, what's the deal with it?!

Please tell me how to beat the shark, or take it away"", 'I like this game alot. It takes forever to get a decent shark if you dont pay. Ive been playing this game to try and get sonething cool. It takea lls forever. And frustrastion only gets you blown up or eatin.and start all over. So if u want to play to retire. Good game. But needs alot of fixing. No friend gifts. The daily bonus is laaaaame. I habe no problem payin some cash but damn. This game could be a hell of alot better. I isually dont rate stuff. So do not waste time unless u got cash', 'I stopped playing for a bit, got back on last year and it was working fine on Bluestacks. I use Bluestacks since my phone overheat and storage space got filled up quick. For some reason, since the last 2 updates or so I haven’t been able to play AT ALL. I can open the game on Bluestacks, make it past the ""Ubisoft"" screen and then get stuck on the image of the newest shark and nothing happens after that. Right now I have Moby Dick and I\'m not starting over AGAIN, so I hope this gets fixed soon!', ""It's a really fun game for people who have patience because once you get to like 5th shark it takes a long time to get coins and level up to get the next shark.

Guess what... 2020 and it is still freezing and loosing progress.', ""It's ok. But the only reason I rate this 4/5 is because there is one thing they didn't add. Is the map!

Why does This hungry shark seem to have a lot of special sharks but the hungry shark word seem to have non!!!?!!!"", ""The game itself is okay, but I hate it how it always loses my progress. Even when I have it saved up on cloud on Google Play Games. It's every time I download this game I always lose my progress. I thought that if I download Google Play Games it wouldn't reset. But it did. Can you somehow fix this? I love this game very much but I can't play it if it keeps deleting my progress."", 'The game is great for when I get bored and want to play every now and then, although at first I enjoyed the deepness and darkness and almost scary feeling of being small in a huge, deep dark ocean with new creatures behind every corner, and id love fir a newer amd deeper and darker ocean with even bigger sharks and new fish.', 'Good BUT Two problems, one even as a beginner shark very strong sharks spawn. This can be a problem for newcomers. Second- As the hammerhead I encountered the plane. It was shooting at me I fled but the bullets were going through the rocks. It then launched me away and the game broke. I had to end my run early.', ""This game is my No.1 favorite game because I like the sharks,gears,and the texture but the time I'm playing this game before it's updated, I can't go to the Crab Lair but I wish right now,the Crab Lair is always available to enter and also new gears."", ""The game that I like to play anywhere I can turn it on in the car while you're gone on long trips it's really fine you have to watch out for certain things after you really get into game you're going to love it I mean it's amazing you'll never want to stop playing it so go ahead and start downloading Hungry Shark Evolution because you're going to love it five stars guaranteed if you don't like it I'll send you money to unlock more sharks bye thanks start playing Hungry Shark Evolution"", 'I love the game. But if you could make an updated rewards for daily rewards. Please update. Since I really love the game I always make sure to visit it daily but after 5 days it will return to day 1 again. Hope that you can change this so that I can also look forward to play it everyday.', 'This is an amazing game apart from one thing. There are not enough sharks. But apart from that one thing this a great fun game. I also love how there are barely any ads at all. I love how you can save your progress and everything is so easy. 100% recommended.', 'Its a fun game, but the zobie sharks kill you every couple of seconds wicth kind of make it impossible to enjoy with all the adds you have to watch everytime you die. I cant play the game for more than 10 seconds before getting killed by a zombie shark. I am literally just watching ads 90% of the time. Not worth it anymore.', ""Usually fun game; but gets VERY irritating when you have the special edition sharks attack you, one bite and your dead and there is no escape, then you get an ad (very clearly a way to get you to see a tonne more adds) because of this I've had games as short as **5 SECONDS**"", 'This is a great game with great features, and all i want and need to say is that i have an idea for a new special shark, so i call it ""angler shark"" with a light on its head and its special ability would be to stun predators with its bright light, causing it to be worth x2 points and this shark should cost 75,000 coins like the ice shark and electro shark', 'It was an amazing game at the first moment but now as we go to higher level or to a bigger shark it seems the ocean is ended and this gets boring. As well there are no new creatures in the ocean. I reached till BIG DADDY and now I cannot explore new things. Please fix it else it is Superb.', 'İts a great game love new abyss shark but can you make the ad for 1 gem to ad for 2 gems like ın hungry shark World and make updates more often i love this game it has alot of potential (atleast i think it does) so keep up the good updates (the only way i got the abyss shark was watching 112 ads) its a great game really so maybe like make a new game like ... Hungry shark 3D? Idk but i hope you make more games like this and you can update them more and i have all 3 of them its really fun game.', 'Very good game loved it you should add more fish and things instead of just more sharks and this is very fun I am on nessie and it is fun and an addicting offline game I like the special sharks as well I started playing it back in 2014 left for a few years because I switched phones and forgot to download it and was surprised to see all the new special sharks and the new normal sharks I would rate it four and a half stars If i could', ""It was good at first, and still is, it's just the game wouldnt let me swim or control the shark and it's gotten very frustrating. I tried to get off the game and get back on, but it didnt work. I also tried to switch the shark, still didnt work. I hope this is just temporary and will be fixed soon, or I figure out how to fix it. Either way, I still really like this game, it's just not functioning how it used to."", 'I love the game i use to play as a kid but when i played it now once i reach hammerhead shark and i go to the same spot as i use to with my last shark in the deep I saw litteraly a shark that i cant kill and they can instakill you if your hp is not full and they will keep trying to attacl you and the worst part thier EVERYWHERE and i cant play as the hammerhead cuz i will get insta kill its so unfair i unlocked it barely and i get that thats so unfair thier everywhere in the map ;(', 'It was fun at first... Like the first shark is the reef shark. After that you just non stop die... Really? Underwater mines on the beaches?? Fire breathing sharks?? Definitely worth playing but gets pretty stupid with as much stuff that kills you....', ""This game is is pretty fun and all but there are some things you need to update one for example you need to make a better way than just eating one fish every 25 times you play the game I'm getting gems cuz sometimes you're going to need a lot and you can't pay 😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁"", ""Why are there so many other sharks? Im not even a minute into a game and there's about 4 chasing me, I can't even play long because wherever i go i get chased and killed unless i have a bigger shark which i don't at the moment. Someone should fix that it's really annoying and unenjoyable.😑"", 'Its the best ofline game in the world!Now ,Im at the great white shark.But thanks for making this game.It is realy fun bacause it has a lot of sharks.But my favourite shark is the leo (leopluradon).I like it because it has big and sharp teeths. Anyways im ratingthis game 5 stars because it looks super realistic.', 'I love the game. I used to have 5 stars on it until they added the new shark, which everywhere I go in the game it is there and my shark is too small. Once again the game is great they just have to many sharks everywhere.', 'This is one of my favorite games. And for a reason. The controls are easy to use, there are little to no ads, and money is easy to earn. And with the easy earned money, the upgrades are very helpful. I 100% recommend this game to everyone!', 'Great game to play when you have nothing else to do. My favorite part is that they make it to where the small sharks level up faster than the big sharks, sense the small sharks are harder to play as.', ""Great game pitty I lost all my progress. Support was not great asked to turn WiFi off etc tried still lost my progress. Cannot prove the items I had. Probably won't install if it happens again."", 'Really fun, i love the seals addition. I had this game when i was younger, and its still a blast. My one complaint is when the mutated sharks kill me, they ""puppygaurd"" me.

VERY disapointing can u make it were i can get it please that would just make my day...kay byee', 'Game is good but the developer wants to become billionaire by forcing the player to spend money on buying sharks or gems.

However, the pricing is a little on the ridiculous side. I would probably spend money on this game if it were more reasonably priced, say in the same range as a standard XBOX or Playstation game for purchase. Being as there are still advertisements in the game play it seems like this could be done. And with the prices being the way they are it makes it almost impossible to get past a certain level before you would have to start buying add-ons.

Don\'t get me wrong, you can quite easily spend much more than that trying to moderate this game\'s occasionally insane difficulty levels, though if you\'re like me, you are too cheap, I mean cost conscious, to spend real money if it\'s not absolutely necessary, so it is now my personal to take this game down without paying a cent.', 'This game used to be very fun and relaxing but recently the developers had a genius idea to make it harder to play and it\'s a constant source of high stress while you play this game now. The enemy alien ships are more tougher and stronger than your ship. And the system mostly now matches you to compete against much higher skilled players. Good thing there are other games like that from other developers who still follow the concept that ""Games are to relax, not to stress you out"".', ""Edit: Latest update keeps freezing and quitting in the middle of play. ------------------ Addictive game, but seems to have a few bugs. Currently, stones don't seem to drop in either hard or crazy making it difficult to evolve ships and get skins. Hopefully this gets patched."", ""The ads eventually take you right to the play store after making you watch them, before you can close them, which is VERY annoying. Also, the game hangs when I try to sign into my pre-existing account that I purchased content on. I tried contacting the game developers for a fix using their email contact and have not received a response. Hoping they will fix the issue. It would be pretty scammy if they didn't. =/""]"

Get in quickly, this event is a limited time only!","[""Great game. I remember playing this years ago and when I redownloaded I really enjoyed it. I have had it for about a month and now there is a problem that's making it really hard to play. Every other second the game freezes for a little under half a second and then continues and then freezes again, etc. I think this is a bug that will get patched and believe this is from the new update, but until a new update comes, don't download it because it is freezing far too often to make it fun to play."", ""The gameplay is just amazing! The fact that you gave us Gadgets and Power-Ups just made the game even better. Also, the events are just spectacular because you're allowing us to get exclusive stuff or even Items we need to buy so thank you for that. This is why I rate it 5 stars!"", ""This has gone downhill more than I could imagine... It's better to watch ads instead of actually playing the game, it takes time to go throu the menus, because of all the fancy animations wich take longer when there is an option to watch ads to continue or something and as soon as there's a update you are forced to uptate, so you can't use any older versions. The unly good things that have been added were the powerups and a few new backgrounds for the map, nothing else was added since 5 years."", ""I ❤️ Jetpack joyride! It is the best game i have ever played! I love the fact that the game gets faster as you go further. I have just updated it so I didn't really get the chance to write about the new features. Anyways, BEST GAME EVER!!!!!"", 'This game is great! Id play it alot when i was small, it was really addictive. Its just as addictive now! The game mananges to have simple mechanics, yet is also extremely polished and fun. Keep it up, Halfbrick!', ""It's very interested!! When I played it for the first time, I found that - it gives me pleasure!! So, I can say it's nice and I dare myself to rate this game - even at least 4 Stars!!"", 'Really like this game although I have some thoughts about removing the old menu, anyway I bought the starter pack and it charged me but somehow I didnt get anything from it and I still have it showing on the menu like I havent bought it, I need help.', 'Too many intrusive ads with no option to skip. After 1-2 games you will loose interest in the game. Feels like you are watching ads most of the time instead of playing.', ""Great gameplay, still getting updates, and finally an app that does free to play right. Doesn't overwhelm you with ads, and some of the in-app purchases feel worthwhile. Great game overall"", 'This game is amazing my favorite part is all of the power ups that you can use to help you I think they should add a Sorta miner going underground power up I also love the daily updates.The controls are good cause their so simple and the gameplay has very good fell to it over all very good game.', ""A good game and is definitely different from other games alike, it's good when you have nothing to do however it can get quite repetitive over time, but I would definitely recommend for in your spare time."", ""Has become very glitchy with the most recent update. Says I haven't fulfilled the requirements to complete a mission when I actually have. The app also crashes occasionally."", 'Very fun and exciting with all the events , Though I would very much like to see a fluffy feline friend join in so I could use a kitty instead of flash, I like cats better. It could be called mittins, waffles or kitty😊', 'I remember it you starting slowly and after hoping back to jetpack joyride after a few years you start with the speed of light barely reaching 1500 distance cant you make it the way it was before?', 'After sometimes,the game automatically start my jetpack and I die every time This is now worst game I ever played I love the before jetpack joyride and now this game has a biggest bug.', ""The game is cool but the commercials are too much for me it's like a commercial app and every few minutes you get to play a game I give it a 1 star"", 'Super fun game, everybody can enjoy it, little kids, elder people, hell even my dog loves this game! Everything in this game is so awesome. Just keep bringing new stuff!', ""I love the game an quality, but theres a bug. When I enter the game and play when I'm in little stomper it glitches. Please fix!"", 'It\'s a decent game but don\'t bother with the ""watch adds for free stuff"" most of the time it Doesn\'t work', ""Awesome game, definitely my favourite.

Jetpack Joyride should have a cult worshipping this!! Only 1 request... Can you please make the items just a bit cheaper? This game is perfect (kinda), and i thank you for making this game!! And anything else i like about this game? Everything. This game is awesome, and I've spent so much time trying to unlock everything, and inevitably... never get there. This game has so much content, and you just can't complete it! This game is awesome, and thanks for making this! :D"", ""Still the best game around REPLY: Wow, that's the first time a dev replies to me. For me in part it is definitely the nostalgia, because this game has been around for a while. I come back years later and it is still every bit as fun. It is bigger though and has no paywalls, so I love that too. Hope that answered your question Chloe, keep being awesome over there!"", ""This is one of the best games. I would give it five stars but there's a glitch. Every time I collect an event token or complete a mission in game it freezes for like 0.25 of a second. This is very annoying because I usually die right after. Can you please fix this glitch. If you do I will give five stars. Thank you. :)"", ""This game is now like it should be! I talked about a bug last time but now it's gone. I like this game alot now!"", ""I give this 4 stars for a few reasons. First, there are a lot of ads, but I understand that. Not many people purchase the packs, so they'vs gotta get the money elsewhere. Second, the game gets pretty laggy at the start of a run, but that has died down of recent. Third, even if you complete the tutorial for Magic Brick Wars, you still cannot recieve the special skin. That really isn't a huge deal. Other than that, the game is pretty fun. Very addicting!"", 'My favorite things about the game except the the addictive gameplay, are of course the so many gadgets i can use,the powers, the roullete at the end,the many rides,and of course the little details like flash having his own gadgets and his ears having through the wind while flying. Its little details like that that makes the game amazing:) and pls create more awesome gadgets, more the better:) Goodluck', ""This is one of those nostalgia games. 101 games, plants vs zombies, doodle jump, fruit ninja, I played all of them as a kid. And it's still great! The game has very good elements, I love everything about his game. The fact that you shoot bullets out your jetpack is cool! It's super cool"", 'Well for starters, I personally think this is one of my favorite mobile games so far, the only reason i would ever give a game I like a below 5-star rating is because of some kind of glitch. For this particular game the glitch was black screening me after a couple of ads, which is really annoying because i have to exit the game and load it back up. However, I have only had this glitch twice now and I hope that this glitch will no longer bother me in future gameplay. Thank you.', 'PLASTERED in ads! If you want to play this game for more than 30 seconds, you\'re gonna have to PAY! Real money, and not just pennies either. Or else there is the ""ransom your attention"" option. Watch the same ad, over and over, for some other freemium game. It\'s odd and it really breaks the mood of what is supposed to be a quick action game. Game-smashing power ups if you\'ll only watch 30 seconds of some utterly different game¡ i remember this game from years ago and it was fun, but not now..', ""It's so fun!! I left the game back in early 2015 cause it felt repeatitive and at the time the only good thing IMO was S A M, but I decided to pick it back up for no particular reason in late 2019 and man has the game improved so much, I was generally shocked by how amazing the game has become and all the new challenges that I encounter throughout each gameplay! Best game I have ever played and I am so happy I decided to pick it back up again! Q: Whats my fav thing about the game A: Power Ups!!"", 'Good game, gets a little repetitive after awhile but still a good game and not to many adds', ""I've played this game when I was younger and now that I've come back it's gotten laggyer in I can't even play a full match"", 'Even after all these years, jetpack joyride is, just that. A joyride. It hasn\'t gotten many updates, but I don\'t think it needs any. It\'s an amazing game as is, and best of all, ITS NOT PAY TO WIN! I mean, it sorta is, but it\'s not as in-your-face ""hey you need more cash, wanna buy some?"" As other games. Ya fun good halfbrick', ""One the better mobile games i had, notice I said had. Spent several days trying to unlock the most expensive items in the game. Was really enjoying, when i uninstalled it to get more space, thinking i would reinstall it sometime. When playing the game again, I was left with none of my progress, I'm almost positive I was signed into google play as I did with every game prior to this one. All of that time spent was wasted when I made the decision to uninstall it. Please fix this. Sincerley, Sggy"", ""This game is fun and I haven't had too many issues with ads but it would be cool if the game was on play pass so that I could still support the game without paying specifically to remove the ads. And also I am having issues with slowdown and lag on the OnePlus 3t. Which considering the tech when this game was originally released should be more than enough to run it smoothly so maybe work on optimisation"", 'The ""new things"" that was added just can\'t make up for the crazy amount of ads added in. I only tried it again because of nostalgia. But yeah, if anything this has became just one of those generic mobile games. Gameplay gets old real quick, get to this certain distance, die, watch ad, die again, watch ad and repeat. Clearing a task get the rewards and upgrades and then what? It ironically feels not so rewarding. The game\'s too repetitive to have this much ads. This is just greedy.', 'Game is completely based around ads. Everything can be achieved by watching more ads. It even forces you to watch ads even when you dont fall for their pathetic scheme and watch a video every time you lose, itll just force you to watch one anyway. Not only that but it hides the X fkr 5 seconds or more so you have no choice but to watch the ad or close the app. Well ive closed the app, permanently. What an absolute trash product. Make a game, not a program that tricks people into watching ads.', ""Edit: this last release is filled with bugs. I've tried twice to get my day-5 SAM, but on the fifth day it says it's day 1. I've paid for the app, but all of a sudden I'm getting pop-up ads again. Minorly, my challenge progress is sometimes not credited (i.e. the challenge is go 1,000m without the machine gun jetpack and I'm on 4,000m with the bubble jetpack and no check mark). I love this game and play it casually, but it's frustrating me with the recent bugs. Thank you!"", ""It is a great game to pass time, i've been playing it since 2015, and i always had a great experience with it. I decided to reinstall it and try it out, but it looks like all my progress and all my in-app purchases have gone to waste, i had a coin doubler, and i was looking forward to use it now, but it seems i have to buy it again, since i can't seem to find a restore in-app purchases button. I hate to be stingy, but i don't really want to pay up another 5.99€ for it again. Great game otherwise""]"

I am told if I watch a 30 second video ad, my player will be bought back to life so I watch the entire ad, I've even tried installing the games but to no avail, I will finish watching the ad, click the exit button to continue playing but am forced to restart because the game thinks I have not watched an ad and keeps my player dead."", 'Super fun to play when bored, good progression (if you remember to open chests alot). Active development that helps to get rid of any glitches. Not alot of ads but there is a bit of a paywall to access the high tier characters, but its not necessary. If you do want to put money in, the membership is astronomically expensive but one time purchases for characters is cheap. All the different weapons have a unique feel but the characters share some weapons so youre never totally lost.', ""If you've seen the review by someone named Ken Edwards, you'd know the awesome new update breaks the game. In my case, when I attempt to start the game it doesn't work. I start the game, but I can't move and there's nothing I can do. I uninstall and reinstall the game and lose my chests and money, that's fine, but after I played the game a bit more and turned it off the next time I tried to start the same thing as before happened. Please let me play this amazing game?"", ""It's a good game but it gives you an option to watch an ad to revive or get 30 stars and it doesn't even give it you when u watch the ad , it's so annoying. And then the tournament, it takes a little time to get the red envelopes and then when u get the 100 coins to play you just die instantly cause there's no place to land. What's the point of it."", 'good game, but unfortunately uses a practice I like to call ""ad shaming"" where everytime you die, you get an ad, and it\'s super annoying. I\'ve even had one to where I couldn\'t get out of the ad, everytime I hit close, the video would wind back and restart.', 'The game is good and all, but there is one problem. The ads. I mean I understand theres ads but I dont get the rewards or get and extra life after I watched the ad. I hope you can fix that so I can give this fun, addicting game 5 star review👍', 'Very repetative. Only way to get good without grinding for days upon days is to pay real life money. When i revive with an ad, i have to watch the ad but it never actually revives me. If these would be fixed i might give it 4 stars, however not an overly-original game, even so.', ""This is a really fun game!!! Like everyone else says, graphics are awesome and the different helmets are so fun! Lots of chances to get chests which u need for things and although there are a lot of ads to watch for things, that is a good thing! Almost a must I'd say."", ""Very funne all in app purchases are worth it and you can test them before you buy them which I've never seen any game do before and it's not just one round you have to test it, it's five rounds. So what I'm saying is get this game. If you don't want ads just turn off internet/data."", ""I like it because you get to get different skins and the more skins you get you get to unlock different weapons and then if you get 200 you get to defeat these bosses and then the levels will go up and it will be 200 anymore but it will give you pets that you can get and do not pets but they help you and you I have one right now which is the princess and she's amazing cuz if you don't have a weapon don't you just wait for them to fight for you cuz they get swords and it's just a awesome game"", ""Game now broken, tapping does nothing. Emails to dev bounce back undeliverable. Before that, lost over 100k gold and countless helm upgrades.

So it kills the guys you're trying to push into the abyss for a quest, and it kills the guys you're trying to TNT for a quest, and it kills the guys you're trying to sword for a quest and it interferes and interferes.

I think the games bad because honestly its not really a ""fun game"" its just like a rage game at this point.', 'The January 2020 update is great! And after they fixed some game-breaking bugs, I am back to playing it daily. Kudos to the dev for pushing out a bug fix so quickly. I LOVE this game.', ""Wish I could give 5 stars, but there would be times I'd watch ads to stay alive and after the ad I'm back at the beginning. Too many ads in general. Edit: had to take another star!!! JUST TOO MANY ADS!! TO MUCH NOT GETTING REWARDS I EARNED FROM WATCHING ADS!! Please fix"", 'Amazing game! I like how they made the helmets and orcs. Also the weapons are pretty cool too. And you get to try some helmets.', ""Ugh this new update has the helmet selection icon blinking no matter what. Even of you've played all the helms you have. I'm OCD enough to find it annoying as heck. The adds are dumb and I get you can pay to have them gone but them popping up EVERY TIME YOU DIE is bat doo doo"", 'I love the graphics and the gameplay.

I pass the loading screen, it gets to the start point and just gets stuck there. Nothing loads, can't play, can't exit. Disappointed."", ""Idk If this is a glitch but my friends gets 300 on the portal and gets the pet. O got eight hundred and didn't. And if you watch a vid to unlock a chest, it doesn't work.

I tryed to press on something and it did not work', 'yeah the game is good.. its fun. but the ""tournament"" options is having some problems. like, it doesn\'t show the results immediately, it needs a lot of time to load, and why does it requires Google Play sign-in every time I enter the game.. and if I don\'t sign-in I can\'t see the tournament results or progress. I hope you are gonna fix this. Thank you.', ""It's a fun game but when I got my old game (from the cloud) I couldn't get my chests that I gave gotten before, not even see them!

I ended up just going to the right infinitely, I got a score of 1269 before I just closed the app. Please fix this bug."", ""So I've got the update working with a reinstall but its jittery and laggy. Not enough difference in the game to warrant this slow down."", 'A bit confusing at first, but otherwise this is a really fun and addicting game. I reccomend opening chests while you are away. There is a wide variety of skins to collect. The only problem is that sometimes the game automatically pulls you back into the void. Anyway, you should get it!', ""It's so annoying when you watch a ad for like a revive, and it doesn't even give you a revive! It makes me so mad that I want to chuck my phone across the room. It wastes your time when you dont get ANYTHING from watching a ad. The game is just here to waste your time and steal your money. I do not recommend, at all."", ""sometimes you get a spell that you don't want and when you get to the boss fights you can't kill them because you don't have a good spell I think you're game would be easier to beat if when you get to a spell that you can choose what spell you want Please do this as I have asked makers of different games to improve with my feedback but they have ignored me Could you also get more spaces for chests. I keep asking to watch a video for a revive and when the video is done it won't let me carry on."", 'Scumy ads but somewhat fun game I have changed my review as the emojis the enemys say are extremely annoying. Ive had to remove another star as the people you rescue can be re-captured which creates an annoying game. When rescuing someone you do not have to feeling of happiness yet you feel that you must make the most of them before they are taken away again. I do not recommend.', ""I really think you should change the game. sometimes when I play it there are orgs before you get a chest with the weapon... and also.. orgs eating you?

I tried uninstalling the game but its still the same...it won't give me energies"", ""I was enjoying this game so much until I got to the Doughnut House. Levels are impossible to beat without boosters. Upgrades are way too expensive. On the top of this, I had my pig full of diamonds for which I had to wait more than 24h to collect (so I could buy the boosters).

This cooking game puts your hand and eye coordination skills to the test. I actually think it is one of the better cooking games. It is similar in mechanics in comparison to the others but the fast pace plating of food, colorful characters & bonus opportunities sets it apart from other cooking games or gives it its own uniqueness rather.', ""I like the app but I can tell that it's all about making money. Example: if I need to reach 18 but reach 23, I dont get the key. How is that right if I passed the stated goal? There is no need to cheat players into purchasing. If the app is good, players will buy.

I don't get a responce when issues arise. I love this game, I love the events and the daily tasks so you don't run out of games. That being said I am very Frustrated that when I buy an extra 30 seconds, you should get 30 seconds! By the time the customers come back in your left with 24 seconds so I end lacking 1 or two points, needing more time. The game should pause until you decide to add time, then resume where it stopped.

However, for the past week or two, after the video plays there is no x for me to go back to the game and pressing the back button does not bring me to the game either. I have to close the app and reopen it. This has gypped me out of multiple rewards. I'm furious. The game is so good but I'm getting so fed up. I don't want to stop playing and uninstall the game because I used to like it so much and I am on the fourth world."", ""All the cooking games so far are all the same! They want you to upgrade with recommended items, but you barely accumulate enough coins to do so, and when you don't upgrade when they want, you start losing.

I'll see how it goes as I progress as it's got my hopes up it's a good game."", 'It was a great game up until the pay to pass levels came up. Making certain levels impossible without boosts. Using boosts are fine if you have them. Getting further into more restaurants i dont have anymore boosts so i cant pass anymore levels. Also the event is also impossible to beat again without boosts. So unfortunate cuz the game itself is so good. Pay to win however is never good. Of course everyone who plays these games enough know how scammy mobile game devs are. Other reviewers agree.', '🔊 Is there a bug/glitch coz the touch control selection does NOT respond, it delays, so the food keeps cooking then burns?. Lost a few games. Some restaurants have food ingredients in awkward position that its quite difficult to manouvre, unless the player has long thumbs. Would be better if the food size is as large as the "" Breakfast restaurant "" in Western World? Please FIX. Anyways the game challenges are GOOD FUN and addictive, with quite generous rewards. Cheers 👍', 'The game is good to play and keeps you busy but on some levels its not fair that the timer runs and noone has walked on yet so you loose time before you even start serving anybody. Then in order for you to get any specials for help you need way to many diamonds, there is no real way to when them. This is very nerve racking.', ""Fun game But is too fast paced. Maybe you can add an option for slow medium and fast. Also is very annoying that you run out of energy and have to wait 30 minutes for it to refill. Don't understand the purpose of that at all."", ""I like this game but the thing is y'all should give us more time when we cooking and the customers leave way too quickly I keep losing energy and coins from upgrading y'all should really make the levels easier instead of keep making us lose coins and you should lower the price for extra time especially if it's only 30 seconds I hope you see THIS COMMENT SO YOU CAN CHANGE UP THE GAME AND LEVELS SO IT CAN BE EASIER PLEASE AND THANK YOU 😡😡😡😡"", 'Fun, but very quickly becomes impossible to pass a level without purchases boosts.', ""So this games is literally a pay to win. You can't get passed level 13 without some kind of help or diamonds. Mind you that's level 13 in the first city in the first restaurant. They don't give you enough time or people to complete any goals they ask you to spend 35 diamonds just to get what u need. Mind u I had already bought all of the upgrades needed to the restaurant. Yea the game is rigged to make you spend money. Crazy part is that's it's so many games like this that are way better."", 'Just like cooking frenzy. But this game is way better!

Is this a way to try and get me to buy the missing balls, or just an incredibly unfortunate coincidence? Also, I spend way too much time watching ads for diamonds, especially while playing challenge mode. I don't like passing it up, because there's no other way to earn diamonds in any kind of timely fashion, but I also hate it. Also, I wish clean shots mattered in challenge mode. They feel very rewarding in timed mode, but very pointless in challenge mode. Maybe they could count for 2 points instead of 1?

It just puts me off the game completely if I'm honest. Every time I die an ad just keeps popping up!! It's really annoying!! I can't believe the developers haven't bothered addressing it!! I know i can pay to remove the Ads if I want to, but why should I? Why can't you just take them off? At least more people would play your game and give it the respect it deserves."", ""look, i get it, developers need ads to pay their bills. but this is too much, they made you watch an ad every single time you die. and this is the type of game where you die a lot. that will get annoying very very quickly. plus at the beginning the game will ask for access to phone calls and files on your phone. for what? that's ridiculous. such a shame for a simple and addictive game"", 'Although I can simply turn on airplane mode the adds are after every single round.', 'Amazing game and super addictive!

Its almost after each game. For developers: it takes more time to watch ads than in time induced in playing game which is irrirating... ads are OK...

It's much better than before."", ""doesn't quite fit the screen but playable. decent. *edit* fixed. The screen issue is due to the resolution setting within the mobile phone settings.

The only downside is no Play Store sync.', ""The game would be a DX if they didn't remove 10 min."", ""Great game, fast paced and easy to learn, (duh its pacman) but championship edition adds a lot of twist to the gameplay. My only concern is darkness levels are buggy. When playing a darkness level. Sprites e.g. ( pac-man, ghost) dont emit light. You are basically blind on these levels. I can see the food. The power pellet and everything except the maze, its just plain black background, and eating a fruit also doesn't show the maze. Hope you guys can fix this. Overall the game is stellar."", ""amazing! this game is guite different than edition 2 plus. but this game is fun. this game is funly awesome!😃 really hope namco make a new pac man game wether be pac man championship edition 3 or pac man world 4 a whole new adventure! this game is so cool 😎! and so much fun! glad it came to phone. thanks namco! you're awesome. I love this game!😊 Also I want a 10 minute mode in this game."", 'Great game, but the collected fruit that displays on the sides gets in the way of the play area.', 'I love pacman and this is just amazing still waiting on PacMan Championship edition 3', 'thanks for fixing the screen issues', 'Several things are missing in this gamw, the Power Pellet Siren, the Speed sound, the correct speed of 30 and 50, The Collect color scheme to the Power Pellet along with the waviness of the maze when the power pellect is active, the ghost eye mark trails, the rainbow colors of the 3200 Point ghost lines, the Eyes of the ghost on one of the skins on the front selection screen, the Original CE Music, the DLC Packs, the music option pf Pac Rainbow, and the 10 Minute Score Attack', 'I never expected that this game would be updated.. I thought I got cash grabbed coz I thought the game was abandoned. The update for support in notch/x64 devices took too long but at least its better late than never. Now the game is fully playable!! No sound/display problems anymore', 'A fun and challenging game. This game has more than just 4 ghost that follows you in a chain line, similar to the game ""Snake"". Basically, the more ghost sees you, the longer the chain becomes, thus making it more difficult to navigate through the maze. Also, the gameplay speeds up the more score you earn, thus adding more to the challenge to the already challenging game. Also the art style of this game is beautiful. Love the neon light art style. Overall, a really fun game.', ""It's a pretty alright port with controller support. The music could use a higher quality though. I hope Namco hasn't forgot about this game and that they can fix this to be the best portable Pac-Man game on mobile."", ""The scroe points don't get any higher because for some reason the game time is way too low to even get score points so I gave up because the game design is impossible to even finish it's terrible to even finish on the PS4 version"", ""Now this bugs me, I've bought the game, but since the aspect ratio is set to smaller devices, or tablets, it doesn't fit my Galaxy S9. So I cant even press start. Like come on.

That being said,  there\'s not a lot of variety when it comes to gamemodes or maps, and loading takes a weirdly long amount of time. There\'s no music or sound effects when not in-game, either.', ""This is a fantastic port to the Android OS. The only sad thing (and reason why it doesn't work anymore for me and some other people) is that the new One UI OS Version update cuts off the right hand screen, effectively labeling the game unplayable. This could probably be fixed by reverting to the old OS Version, if the developers updated the app, or if the One UI reverted the change that caused these problems. By the way the game is amazing. Just don't download it if you have the One UI OS update"", ""This is the best pac man game I have ever played I've played and I've also played championship edition 2 and it was really good as well but I've never played the first one until now and I'm glad I have both of them thank you namco for putting this game on the playstore your the best👍"", 'S9+ DISPLAY ISSUE FIX: Settings>Display>Full Screen Apps.

There's a big black bar left on the left side of my phones screen due to this offset."", ""Much better than the original Pac-Man Championship. This deluxe version has better gameplay, better graphics, better music and is more cheaper (because I got it for sale) than the original! You can't go wrong with this game."", 'Horrible app. Screen mode is too large and unable to play game.', 'This game is amazing I love how you can change the graphics and the different modes. This game obviously had a ton of time put into it and it is definitely worth every last penny.', 'Everything about this game is awesome and worth the price.

It's something to keep you busy if you find yourself bored and it doesn't feel too demanding in both attention and microtransactions. Ive never felt pressured to spend money, so that's a plus.

I remember playing it when I was little and I'm hooked again! I love the visiting friends feature, although it takes a bit to sync and I wish you could do more with friends.

My one little gripe is the constant loading times which is unusual for a game that's not very intensive. Every menu change you'll see that green spinner..."", 'Im trying to get to a certain point before I actually give my review. This won\'t be able to happen because I cannot get far enough with the spamming of ""please give us a review."" I\'ve been ignoring it as best as I can but when you are questing and you have to change stages. You have to go back to town, where you immediately get the pop for ""please review your game experience."" This is my review now. Maybe I\'ll change it, maybe I won\'t.', ""Great game, I do love the heroes and their soulbound weapons and I do really love the 2D graphic style.. although I'm having an issue regarding of accessing to the game, in which it takes me some time to log in... I'll vote it 3 stars at this point because the reason above, but still I do love the game. Please make an update that should be easy access to it.."", ""Overall definitely a great game. It is very possible to do well without ever spending money. Grinding isn't that tedious because rewards are usually pretty sizeable and the devs are definitely very generous with gifts and events. The pixel art is great and so are all the actual illustrations. However I will say that, as someone who started before SBWs, I feel as though there has been a decrease in translation quality, and the English can sometimes sound awkward and broken."", 'In Less than a day I reinstall ""twice"" this game, because the file easily corrupted. When I minimize and maximize it back, it resets and it got stuck at Hangame. Sometime it also tells me to switch my network. I am using my mobile data to play this game. Because of the above issue I have no choice but to clear data and redownload it. It also happen in the past aswell. This ""error"" should have been dealt with. Please fix this, my data is limited. Redownload 750mb everytime it corrupt is pain.', ""Very few pixel art games are impressive nowadays. However, I can wholeheartedly say that this game is among those few. When I originally played for the shield hero crossover, I fell in love with this game in a way that I haven't before. I can't recommend this game enough as it is stunning, or as how Keanu Reeves would say, breathtaking."", ""I want to rate it higher, but its painfully slow. Anytime you click on literally anything you're met with a loading circle for at least 5 full seconds. Which is completely ridiculous for just going through your hero's and looking at stats. Also, when I downloaded the game for the first time, it did it's own seperate download that took almost 5h. And I know it had nothing to do with my internet speed because every other device was still fine."", 'Im really trying to give this game 5* as in regards to gameplay it has everything that any gatcha fun can dream for. Unfortunately its UNPLAYABLE due to loadong screens literally popping up like mad. Everything you do equals to seeing green circle of death. You scroll your screen? Loading. You click whatever? Loading. Its a real pity as the game has a lot of content and its really good. Unfortunately no way to play it.', ""I've been playing this game for awile and it has been pretty good most of the way but ever since inheritance was introduced ALOT of heros fell out of favour & use. They desperately need to balance this game so that every character is viable and not just a select few. They need to buff them so that they are more viable in the Modern CQ cause right now they are stuck in the old CQ collecting dust because for some reason they left them behind. I'm taking a 6 month hiatus off of this game, GoodLuck."", 'Starting 2/3/2020 the game started to have alot of connection problems. Im using an Samsung S10+ (dont know if thats part of the problem), but it really hinders me from playing the game. Everytime i click on a feature it has the green circle loading for at least 2 whole minutes while showing ""reconnection problrm"".

For now im uninstalling the game until this problem is fixed, because its a waste of time.', 'I finished the first chapter of the story mode and my characters are already high level which is nice, the character progression is rather fast and so far I have ran into no issues with the game gladly. I think this was a rather thought out and well developed game for people to spend their time with although I do hope to see more characters added in the future especially more gunners.', ""It's not obvious that's it's pay to win until you play for a little while but the way they do it is by allowing characters that you pay for to remain overpowered. The game lacks balance and after playing for a really long time and grinding it just becomes frustrating, though to be honest it's not nearly as bad as a lot of other games"", 'Very fun if you like anime themed games and anime in gereral, i esspecially love the 8bit vibe the game has. I would give it a 5 star but i always believe that there is always room for improvement. I have found nothing wrong with the game so far so yeah give it a try', 'The ads are a lil slow to load and i wish something was done about the loading at times...not that its super slow like some games but this has got to be one of the best rpgs for mobile ive ever encountered..kudos to the development team for an rpg that i dont lose interest in after a few days like i do with most...i could play this for as long az it exists!', ""It's a fairly fun game, but the slow loading times take me out of it. Nearly every time you press a button, it takes ~5 seconds to go through. While this in one instance isn't a long time, the fact that to do anything you have to sit and wait for upwards of 30 seconds just ruins it for me."", ""VERY good story and gameplay is enjoyable but after a while it gets pay 2 win and and harder to grind meaning you barely can get any jewels at launch it was simple and now even finishing hard episodes and side quests you cant get any it's like they want you to whale also log ins are terrible Please fix the resource jewels grind."", 'Awesome game, great storyline, easy to control, Definitely worth the download. This game sets the bar on how developers should run its games. The only ads are voluntary and get you free chars/equip thanks for the fun and entertaining game!', 'Great little game. More fun than I thought. :) Just the slightly long loading times are a bit annoying. But they are no game breaker.', ""Fun little gem. Sure it's got massive monetization embedded within the core gameplay.

Also NOW the game can't let me in, always stacked in 9.7% !!!.. why!?"", 'I was so excited for the rising of the shield hero event. I wanted Noafumi so badly. I spent over 400 dollars on the summoning banner and did not pull a single copy. I instead pulled 9 copies of file, 3 raphtalia, 3 glass, 4 filotoria and 2 of the green hair character. That is ridiculous. Spending that much money I should have multiple copies of noafumi!!!!!!!!!!', ""Despite the developers' insistence that they only need a small subset of permissions for device information, this game IMMEDIATELY asks for permission to make and manage phone calls upon installation. There's ways to establish a unique user ID without relying on this incredibly shady method. Instant uninstall from me. Might revisit if this is changed."", ""Why is this game always stuck to loading screen 9.7 % then wants me download 721mb (but I already fully downloaded the game) every week or every 3 days?

I have 2 save slots in which one of them was unable to generate another platform so I could proceed. Basically, the world didn't go on a loop or anything, the platform just ended. If I walk through it, I'll fall out of the map and somehow went back to a random spot until I run back there again to fall on the same spot. *spoilers* The second save was really frustrating, I managed to insert the last relic, but nothing actually happened. I've searched it up and after that part you were supposed to choose to be a deer or go back as a human. So I quit the app and closed it and then opened it again, nothing changed.

The stats on my save file icon remained the same besides to deer age. Otherwise, great game with very beautiful graphics (especially the lighting) and interesting puzzles.', ""The pixel retro graphics still deliver and I really love the sound and music of this game.

I remember downloading it in all the craze when it first came out when I was growing up, and it was so addictive. After some years of getting busier and not playing much on my phone, I've downloaded it again for a bit of nostalgia - and boy did this game deliver. There are new stages that absolutely amaze me, even more than the original stages did. There's a retro stage with characters from old arcade games that is just so much fun!

The controls are simple, the gameplay is amazing, and to be honest, if you can get quite good at the game (hitting 100k), the ads aren't that big of a deal. Oh, and the themes are wonderful. A slight problem is that sometimes, when I play, the doodle becomes stiff as heck, and sometimes it feels like he's high on sugar. But that just makes the game more interesting. It's a great game, with great mechanics and great gameplay. Great job, and keep it up."", 'Doodle jump is a really fun game to play but there are way to many ads I know you can buy the thing to stop ads but there are still way to many the last complaint is that it takes up a lot of space for such a simple game overall it is a really good game and fun game to play 💞💖', ""This is a fun game if your favorite part of watching tv is the commercial break. I've been playing since 2009 and it's consistantly been one of my favorite games. But recently they added ads and have completely ruined the gaming experience.

I'm uninstalling and can't reccomend anyone play this advertisement disguised as entertainment."", ""This was a good game, fun and a good time waster but seriously? All those ads? The game consistently annoys you with ads to the point where you either pay for the 'no ad version' or you just delete. The game was good but of course the hungry developers got money hungry so whenever you die you get an ad, and with those horrible controls you're definitely going to get a bunch of ads. The game doesn't see the people downloading the game as people they see them as a way to make profit. Disgusting. 👎"", ""WAY TOO MANY ADS! Okay, I know there's a remove ads thing for $0.99 but I mean, come on! You guys have your own ARCADE GAME,and you guys have so many downloads of your game. Every single time you fall, there's an ad! Like you guys made such a great game and now your getting greedy. I would understand maybe every like 10 trys you get an ad, maybe 5, but every single time? I suggest you lower the number of ads for a better game play."", ""Fun game, WAY to many ads. Literally after every death there's an 'interactive' ad that forces you to wait for an x to show up twice, and it also asks for your age in order to play."", ""I'm disappointed 😞. Honestly it's a great game, fun to play and addicting. The controls, gameplay, and graphics are great! But there are way to many advertisements. You have left me no choice but to delete it.😞"", ""Recently I keep getting 30 second long unskippable ads after I die in game. Some of these ads don't even let you close out of them when they're done so I have to close the whole game. A shame that such a classic app has been ruined by greed."", ""Theres a problem where you can't control your Doodle, and you just jump to the right side of the screen please fix this"", ""Terrible Ads. It was fine till the ads could be closed in 5 seconds, but now they're supplying ads that don't go away unless you click on them. Freaking pathetic. Not expected from a legacy game.

Its mentally degrading really."", ""This game used to be so fun, so I downloaded it again, not even 5 minutes in and I get bombarded with all these annoying ass ads.

I talked about a bug last time but now it's gone. I like this game alot now!"", ""I give this 4 stars for a few reasons. First, there are a lot of ads, but I understand that. Not many people purchase the packs, so they'vs gotta get the money elsewhere. Second, the game gets pretty laggy at the start of a run, but that has died down of recent. Third, even if you complete the tutorial for Magic Brick Wars, you still cannot recieve the special skin. That really isn't a huge deal. Other than that, the game is pretty fun. Very addicting!"", 'My favorite things about the game except the the addictive gameplay, are of course the so many gadgets i can use,the powers, the roullete at the end,the many rides,and of course the little details like flash having his own gadgets and his ears having through the wind while flying. Its little details like that that makes the game amazing:) and pls create more awesome gadgets, more the better:) Goodluck', ""This is one of those nostalgia games. 101 games, plants vs zombies, doodle jump, fruit ninja, I played all of them as a kid. And it's still great! The game has very good elements, I love everything about his game. The fact that you shoot bullets out your jetpack is cool! It's super cool"", 'Well for starters, I personally think this is one of my favorite mobile games so far, the only reason i would ever give a game I like a below 5-star rating is because of some kind of glitch. For this particular game the glitch was black screening me after a couple of ads, which is really annoying because i have to exit the game and load it back up. However, I have only had this glitch twice now and I hope that this glitch will no longer bother me in future gameplay. Thank you.', 'PLASTERED in ads! If you want to play this game for more than 30 seconds, you\'re gonna have to PAY! Real money, and not just pennies either. Or else there is the ""ransom your attention"" option. Watch the same ad, over and over, for some other freemium game. It\'s odd and it really breaks the mood of what is supposed to be a quick action game. Game-smashing power ups if you\'ll only watch 30 seconds of some utterly different game¡ i remember this game from years ago and it was fun, but not now..', ""It's so fun!! I left the game back in early 2015 cause it felt repeatitive and at the time the only good thing IMO was S A M, but I decided to pick it back up for no particular reason in late 2019 and man has the game improved so much, I was generally shocked by how amazing the game has become and all the new challenges that I encounter throughout each gameplay! Best game I have ever played and I am so happy I decided to pick it back up again! Q: Whats my fav thing about the game A: Power Ups!!"", 'Good game, gets a little repetitive after awhile but still a good game and not to many adds', ""I've played this game when I was younger and now that I've come back it's gotten laggyer in I can't even play a full match"", 'Even after all these years, jetpack joyride is, just that. A joyride. It hasn\'t gotten many updates, but I don\'t think it needs any. It\'s an amazing game as is, and best of all, ITS NOT PAY TO WIN! I mean, it sorta is, but it\'s not as in-your-face ""hey you need more cash, wanna buy some?"" As other games. Ya fun good halfbrick', ""One the better mobile games i had, notice I said had. Spent several days trying to unlock the most expensive items in the game. Was really enjoying, when i uninstalled it to get more space, thinking i would reinstall it sometime. When playing the game again, I was left with none of my progress, I'm almost positive I was signed into google play as I did with every game prior to this one. All of that time spent was wasted when I made the decision to uninstall it. Please fix this. Sincerley, Sggy"", ""This game is fun and I haven't had too many issues with ads but it would be cool if the game was on play pass so that I could still support the game without paying specifically to remove the ads. And also I am having issues with slowdown and lag on the OnePlus 3t. Which considering the tech when this game was originally released should be more than enough to run it smoothly so maybe work on optimisation"", 'The ""new things"" that was added just can\'t make up for the crazy amount of ads added in. I only tried it again because of nostalgia. But yeah, if anything this has became just one of those generic mobile games. Gameplay gets old real quick, get to this certain distance, die, watch ad, die again, watch ad and repeat. Clearing a task get the rewards and upgrades and then what? It ironically feels not so rewarding. The game\'s too repetitive to have this much ads. This is just greedy.', 'Game is completely based around ads. Everything can be achieved by watching more ads. It even forces you to watch ads even when you dont fall for their pathetic scheme and watch a video every time you lose, itll just force you to watch one anyway. Not only that but it hides the X fkr 5 seconds or more so you have no choice but to watch the ad or close the app. Well ive closed the app, permanently. What an absolute trash product. Make a game, not a program that tricks people into watching ads.', ""Edit: this last release is filled with bugs. I've tried twice to get my day-5 SAM, but on the fifth day it says it's day 1. I've paid for the app, but all of a sudden I'm getting pop-up ads again. Minorly, my challenge progress is sometimes not credited (i.e. the challenge is go 1,000m without the machine gun jetpack and I'm on 4,000m with the bubble jetpack and no check mark). I love this game and play it casually, but it's frustrating me with the recent bugs. Thank you!"", ""It is a great game to pass time, i've been playing it since 2015, and i always had a great experience with it. I decided to reinstall it and try it out, but it looks like all my progress and all my in-app purchases have gone to waste, i had a coin doubler, and i was looking forward to use it now, but it seems i have to buy it again, since i can't seem to find a restore in-app purchases button. I hate to be stingy, but i don't really want to pay up another 5.99€ for it again. Great game otherwise""]"

Thank you for playing Sky Force 2014 - we've made it for you! Please do not forget to rate the game every time it gets udpated.","[""Graphics is good. But what I don't like is the controls. Wherever you put your finger, your plane follows it. So your plane is under your finger. Your finger blocks your plane and you can't see it which makes you die easier. Try playing some similar games like this and you'll see what to fix about your controls. Try 1945. Controls are good."", ""Very little control. No forgiveness when being shot for very minor damage and then dead. Game over. I wish I could give this game less than one star. .

Never ever download any Sky Force game again! You people need to make this game fun and you don't. . I hope everyone follows my Lead and advice and does not s"", 'Like so many games, lots of potential wasted by greed. Ads AND microtransactions (seriously, pick one) & expensive upgrades compared to how much you earn combined with big jumps in difficulty between levels means doing a level over & over ad nauseam to afford upgrades to be strong enough to move on.

Permissions also concerning.', 'One of my favorite games of all time, along with its sequel ""Reloaded"". It\'s not pay to win, but to avoid grinding, it\'s totally worth it to pay for double stars, no ads, and buy yourself about 20,000 stars right at the beginning. After that, then the game is a lot better. This game\'s is better than most paid apps. I\'d pay $5 for the game. But it\'s basically a ""paid quality"" game that allows you to play it for free with ads. I look at buying those 3 options as just buying the game.', 'Not exactly ""pay to win"" , but more ""pay to have fun"". You have to spend stars to upgrade your ship and to play the levels (unless you want to wait for several minutes).

It\'s several years old and it kind of shows.', ""Very enjoyable game. Loads up quick and easy, means you can use it on the bus waiting in line or just fun purely at anytime. Best arcade experience.

This was a good attempt at the original, this app needs work for the controls to be mapped in addition I cannot change the video settings. I am requesting a refund. Please note that your experience may be better. I was using the Nvidia Shield to play this game.', ""It's the original! I've been so sick of all the Damned remakes. I've dreamed about the original forever. I loved this game since the arcade and haven't seen it since. Untill now. A dream come true. And coincidentally during the Christmas season.😁 Gotta love it."", ""My go to game for those times I feel like kickin' ass while taking a trip down memory lane. Talk about total nostalgia!

The good ol' days of my wasted youth lol"", ""This is a game that I grew up on and there's still not a dull moment when I play it. It really brings me back to when things were a whole lot simpler!

This was hands down, one of my very favorite games of all time growing up as a kid in front of my grandmas television screen with a NES controller in my hand. However it was a slightly different version, still just as good as any. The controls however seem to do its own thing occasionally and ghat gets a lil frustrating.

Thank you', ""Great game! The Double Dragon Trilogy is definitely one of my all time favorite beat em up games in the genre. This is a terrific remake of the originals too by the way, but I have an issue with the control's. It seems like good ol' Billy boy here has a bit of a mind of his own at times and the direction in which he is attacking (Or Attempting To At Least) is the opposite of where I intend him to attack his opponent, for whatever reason I just simply cannot understand whatsoever."", ""Nostagically speaking this game is great! But you could improve on the controls and operation of the character in the fight sequences. It almost seems that Billy or Jimmy doesn't have a fighting chance in hell when it comes to opponents because the controls aren't as old school as you think, because I whipped the game's ass on the Nintendo back in the day of the year 1988 or 1989 when I was in Jr. High School. Now that's Old School C.V.J. people."", ""Reminds me of the actual arcade when i was a kid, i love it i play it at least 6 to 8x's a day"", 'The game does not start. I have to re-install and then after playing couple of times, it agaij does not start/open', 'pretty awesome. controls could be a little better, but so can all old games brought to cell phone apps. all considered the controls are better than other cell phone emulated games. that and Double Dragon 3 is always going to suck. stick with 1 and 2. well worth the 5 bucks just for those 2 games', 'I love it keep up the good work the controls are great and I hardly say that with games on mobile great job guys', 'Controls are too hard but trying the game did bring back good memories.', 'The game crashes abruptly. Not having a good experience.', ""NOT the game I know and love. This is not the same game. I'm sorry I played dd2 a lot. And straight up the level layout is different. The controls are terrible even with a controller. Don't spend money on this if you are looking for the original experience."", ""controls are well wonky but the most annoying thing of all is that you get stuck in an AI loop of being pounded to the ground, AI pounds you into the ground again, then again and again and again etc etc. I've purchased both r-type games so please refund me on this please"", 'Awesome collection. The controls can be tough though.', 'Hello developers, my friend and I bought this game cause it said it has a CO - OP mode but that one does not work at all! Why is that?', 'Apart from controls games are cool. Played them on Arcade emulator. Sounds awesome music wise. Bought DD 4. See you soon for Double Dragon 5.', 'Absolute rubbish, won\'t launch on my P20, just sits saying ""Starting""', 'after palying for some time the game wont start. I tried restarting my phone so many times but still wont start. the screen only says starting. money wasted', ""Controls are awful.. You lose multiple lives by just falling off the edge or into water because you can't control the player properly"", ""it's not a bad game, buttons are nice. more continues be ok, online play would be awesome."", 'i loved these games as a kid and this would be some great throwbacks but one issue...the controls are HORRIBLE!!!!', 'Awesome bit of nostalgia! Reminds me of my youth, hanging around arcades.', 'Great game, too bad the controls are so awful!', 'No Multi Controller support for Nvidia Shield rendering Co-Op mode... WORTHLESS!', 'Its ok, fun for a while, controlls are abit meh but passes 10 minutes or so.', ""Double Dragon is the best fighting, acting game and have a them games on Nintendo and Super Nintendo too. Billy and Jimmy Lee awesome Martial Arts fighters in 1980's and now!"", 'love this game!!!! buttons are ok. i can manage. worth the price', 'Just like playing it in the arcade when I was a kid! Just playing DDragon on my phone now!', 'Game just says ""Starting..."" and hangs there.', 'Outstanding Job ! To keep it thw same as when it first came out! Wow! Makaveli!', 'Button placement could be better', 'Great game play. Easier to play with mobile phone mode.', 'Awsome with a controller! without it . . not good at all. .', 'Fun and action packed!']"

Numerous bug fixes","[""THE NEW 40TH ANNIVERSARY INTERFACE IS UGLY! Please bring the interface back to the old version. The interface of the mazes menu (relaxed, challenging, and elite) to select any mazes I want to play is totally awful! The mazes grid view dissapeared and changed to scroll side-by-side, which make me frustrated cause I have to scroll them one by one to choose, and there are no crown icons on each thumbnails so I can't notice which mazes I've completed or not. Better make a grid view like the old one."", ""Every version update gets worse and more commercial. Now there are more commercials than ever and constant pressure to watch more apps. Has become very invasive and ruined a good game. I'll have to give up on this game. Tried it again with new update. Now it's even worse. Only three tournament credits at s time? You can't even play one round of all 3 tournaments! Who's lousy idea was that? And try not to be juvenile and patronizing in your responses. You've ruined a great app."", ""Great game. However, after the update it won't you to collect the coins after completing a mission. The old missions just sit there"", ""Love the new UI! Will you guys be adding special mazes again for the 40th anniversary like you did for the 35th anniversary? Because that would be great! I'd 100 percent buy them if you did!"", ""I really like this game but man.. it's sooo frustrating!!!! The amount of times it has crashed, it just keeps circling & I have to restart! Ruins the flow.. all I wana do is play? So annoying coz I really like the game."", 'This game sucks when the ghost get close in pursuit the Pacman tends to turn around on its own accord or just quit working altogether I thought it was me at first but when the pursuit is hot the game has a flaw even the direction arrow will be facing the way you had directed although Pacman just turns on its own and usually directly toward the ghost', 'I really like playing this Pac-Man game and playing all of the difference stages make the Pac-Man game really interesting and fun for me.', ""It's fun but needs fixing game makes Pacman die making him change direction so player does not see his or her potential to get much further and to Garner more game play points."", ""Could have been worse, but it doesn't actually have original pac man in it at all, just a reasonable facsimile with alot of unique mazes"", ""Pretty cool game but it would be and awesome game if pac-man would keep going the way that I try to move him, he even sometimes turned on his own! And when I win it will ask if I want to watch a video to double my points and I don't know y because it just says no current offers available and it's the same thing when I try to get more points, but it makes u watch 5 seconds of a video and give nothing for it! That's bulls**t if they aren't going to let me willingly watch any videos y offer?!?!"", ""Game play needs a little improvement controls are slightly erratic at times, if you are going to offer commercialized game play then you need to have something to offer or don't on my phone it just doesn't seem to work ever. That's a Motorola G7 power! I play everyday and I love this game, ever since it came out back in the 80s and no I don't miss the old Joystick controller!!!"", ""This is a great game but I already had the game for more than 2 years and purchase more points to play more levels. And just today I wanted to play my game and the program wouldn't allow me to play so I had to uninstall the game and once I installed the game again this time I lost all the points I had from my purchase. I had 250 points. If you can please give me my points so I can play my levels again that would be a nice thing to do. It's not my fault that the game crashed. Please respond!!"", 'This application gave me the classic maze for free when I download the only version on Google play games which was free which is socool. However, when I bought the premium version on my iPad and it worked well for more than a year but then dispite the fact that my iPad was convicted to a network which I know for a fact that internet was available decided to stop conecting to the internet. But I still love the game for the gameplay. And love old school games like Pac-Man.', 'Great I like how you can double the amount of coins you get by watching an ad.', ""I always play the same game over and over why can't the game move to another stage"", 'i love the OG pacmanand this is great not five stars because it is not the machine and is not glitching through ghost', 'Good times, i got a nee phone installed the app, it reconozed my user name butlost over 1000 tokens, i basically am starting over, bummer, in the past when i changed phones but kept the same phone number i was able to continue my progress, i can only hope the app at somepoint lets me update to my saved completed progress, well i better get busy playing PAC MAN, Man!!!!', 'I am playing this game since my childhood.and this game is truly amazing with best GUI experience.hats off guys good work.thanks for bringing this.cheers.', ""It doesn't have enough video to let you get extras coins always says none at this time . ."", 'Decently good fun but these touch controls with Pac-Man feel like a sin.', ""Changed my rating from 5 because as soon as I got so far, the tournaments don't update anymore!!! Same games every day!! And I can't watch an ad to increase my rewards on regular games or daily rewards, says not available, but then an ad pops up when I try to change screens. Really???"", ""Great game orginally but this version has to many bugs the power pellets either don't last or work at all so there's no chomping ghost's for points and the ghost's are faster than Pac-man able to run him down even after he's already evaded them guaranteeing you die no matter how good you are at this game..this needs to be fixed immediately or we all need our money refunded...these obvious problems are what's keeping this all-time classic from being an easy automatic 5 star rating."", 'This game ate my battery faster then pacman could eat the dots. this game is extremely heavy on the battery and is laggy if you dont have a high end phone, during the lag (or just randomly i really dont know) the game will take away your control to let you get killed off by a ghost, the control loss can take from 1 second all the way up to 10. i suggest that if you dont have an extremely expensive phone and you dont use your phone for playing games more then for calls, then do not get this game.', ""Always nags to play an ad to claim rewards or continue to play when you are out of lives, but the app comes back saying that there are no active campaigns to choose from yet plays ads on existing game. Thanks for nothing, you're welcome for a single star. Would prefer 0 stars bug google won't all it. (Typical bs)"", 'It used to be a five star game but play time has drastically gone down because of advertisements. There seems to be plenty of commercials until you hit boost or attempt to get more charges to play the tornament. Then if you win the tornament you dont get the prize coins anyway.', ""Soooo,this game is quite good but the only thing is it keeps on crashing and stopping.Once , all of the pellets,ghosts and pacman disapeared leaving only the map and me trying to understand what happened.I wasn't even able to complete one stage without the game crashing...so it leaves me with 2 stars"", ""Brings back memories, when there were places full of video machines that we'd spend hrs there playing as kids. So fun"", 'I still like the game alot but l can only ply two rounds of one game then l have to ""close all"" and tap the app for pac man and start all over again. I have to do this over and over again to be able to play the game, or just not play. Can you remedy this problem? Thank you.', 'My question is this, How are we supposed to get free coins if the videos are NEVER AVAILABLE so basically your just gonna dysfunction that so we have to use money to buy coins. This is a great game but how it is ran by the app owners is not right.', ""Great Game, Awesome..... but please fix the bug. It's been hours since I haven't been able to open the game. FYI - every other game is opening except Pac-man."", '*sigh* why did you take away two challange staminas and double the refresh time? Do you want me to play the game less? Are the controls for Pacman getting worse? At least you finally took your claim for blutooth gamepad support off the description as after three years that might be a bit misleading.', ""This game is really hard I always lose the game 😭 like pretend I'm playing the game. But then I push the button for the game.I start playing and then I don't know where to go.🤔 Because the game doesn't have a path to go. Only dots."", ""I purchased this game back in May 7th 2017 I recently purchased a new phone and I paid $1.99 plus tax to have an ad free game Now that I installed it into my new phone I'm getting the Ads again please fix this I will be more than happy to give 5 Stars once the problem is fixed"", 'It is a fun game to play just need more tokens.', ""This game is awesome,,,I played as a kid and couldn't believe I found it and I could download it on my android phone,,but I have beaten every level twice and wish they keep surprising me with new games!!"", ""It's good but where are the different levels and the tournament buttons and I can only play the classic level and I want the other types of levels back please do you hear me whoever created this I like the game but I want the different types of levels I'm stuck on the classic only and that's the only one I can play so please can you and why is there some dumb holiday present thingy on the bottom of the of the right part of the app I want to know why okay from me Matthew Nunez"", 'I used to play Pac-Man on the PC back then but its alot better now', ""And yet another update messes up the game. No ads will even load anymore. What's the point of offering ads to skip or continue if there is never any available. Horrible."", 'The game was fun for me, and there was only ever an ad when i died. Great time killer amazing grafics, and exept for 5 lives and the normal having 3, the gamr is like a free version of pac man but better.', ""Good mazes... Can't play it offline.
