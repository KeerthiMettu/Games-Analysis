The only problem is the battle pass. I don't know if I'm the only one that doesn't know how it works. Oh can't forget about the Freakin' cool maps with good music."", ""it's good but the thing is it gets boring quick maybe you should add new game modes or make getting money a little bit easier because how hard it is in 3 mins you get like 3 coins like how is that so if you are reading this add a big update for that!! If you do you will get like 4 more 5 stars from from my other account wait I mean 5 more because including me so plz do this i bet everyone would like it."", ""I love this game, it's hard to get used to if your usually an Xbox or ps type of person like me, but it is easier than most games. The settings are adjustable just like one Xbox or ps so you can play comfortably. It's easy to work with and it's super fun, unfortunately there is a max level of 55 that you can reach, but fortunately it takes a while to get there so you can still have plenty of fun, even if you have reached the max level, you can still play the same games, but you won't earn any xp"", 'I think that this is a great game to play with friends, and it has a wide variety of maps, avatars, and weapons (at a reasonable price). However, whenever I enter the Battle Royale, the game just freezes. This has happened multiple times, and also the game is rather slow to load. I would really appreciate if you could try and fix this. Overall, I think that this is a great game, so thank you! üòâüòâ', 'I cant say how terrible this game has gotten. First of all, the one hit weapons. What the hell were you thinking? Oh yeah, you just want money, you dont care about the players who get 1 shot every time they spawn. And in deathmatch, players spawn right behind you and then kill you 1 second later. Theres no point in trying to grind because you will get put back down by players who spend money to buy weapons. Its pay-to-win and I dont recommend playing this game because you will waste your time.', ""Almost perfect game, a few issues: Players whom have a grapple gun make flag capture completely unplayable, perhaps lock out grapple weapons in games where they give too much of an advantage? And the bubblegum.. even if you're above it or around it, it still slows you down, this makes trying to avoid it pointless, as the hitboxes for it seem to be very cloudy. Other than that it'd be a 5/5, please fix if you can?"", 'Best game ever playes dosent waste ur battery. Good controlls. Very eaay to controll and if its bad u can just chane it and basacley its the best game i ever played and it so easy apart the ones when it starts to get harder but i can still do itand if this game was deleted i would have nothing else to do!! Anyways however reads this download the game staright away ;) and it dosent waste ur time and me and my cousin play it every day and we kill the people ;) and if u font fownload it ur stupid!!', ""So, about pixel gun 3d... In the past, you could buy every weapon with gems or coins, but now you can only win some of them (like 60 of them) anda whole bunch of event weapons. I played back when level 45 was max and you actually got matched with people with similar weapons or skill. Now people with level 400 efficiency weapons come in and one shot you. Which is total bs. And every one of them plays woth auto aim and the ones with max weapons who don't use auto aim are easy to kill. Fix it pg3d."", 'Its was a good game at first, its pay to win which would be fair enough if the tapjoy free gems worked but after completing it told me wait 2 days, its now been over a week and still nothing. Also if you watch a video at the end of a game for x2 rewards itll have already put you in another game by the time you finish it and then takes stuff off you for leaving. This makes it impossible to keep up with the people that put money into it and you end up being dominated every game by laser guns ect', ""I love this game, really. I used to play it all the time when I was younger and it's awesome to see that one of my favorite childhood mobile games has improved and is still going. People have said this game is pay to win or is a scam, don't listen to these people. The game never forces you to buy anything and it always give you what you payed for. You are NEVER required to pay any money in this game."", ""Terrible, I used to play the game alot, then the game got a rework to be pay to win. Unless you're too tier player, you will have to pay at some point. It's not like cod mobile where you just can buy skins that give your MINOR traits, but in pixel gun the average rifle will have you paying $3 for something that when you level up you will most likely need to replace, which is more expensive. This game is fun when playing with friends or on campaign, but they need to make the game fair for newbs."", 'I used to play a long time ago and it was great, it was fun and felt rewarding. Now i cant get my old save progress, and the way the game is now its just not as fun, i miss the old game with friendly chat rooms, there was nothing that seemed impossible to get or isnt overpowered. The game is ruined. They changed the format of the game and made everyone restart essentially and it is a brutal experience to new players almost forcing to pay to cut ridiculous grind times and get an advantage.', ""Pretty lit game, after the modules and all that advanced stuff lost traction. I still prefer the 2017-18 days tho, at least I want the old guns back. I only gave it 4 stars for the nostalgic memories however ive seen the game start to become annoyingly paytowin and I'm only getting along because of my grinding before p2w began. Really hoping they remove the stupidly high prices and upgrades because I really doubt new players would like the game and I'm also sure this is why all old friends gone"", ""I have decided to give pg3d 3 stars instead of 5 because of a specific issue that I've been having since the 2019 Halloween update. When I log on to pixel gun everything is going well... Except for when I go to collect my daily rewards, my game starts to lag, then the screen starts to look like it's being possessed by a demon. It literally starts showing random letters and numbers, and sometimes the weapons will glitch out and they show up on different areas of the screen. Please fix this PG3D!"", ""I love pixel gun 3d, don't get me wrong, but recently it's been getting SO pay to win, ever since level 55. Plus why would u add 10 levels and ONLY add 1 gun. Don't even get me started on the upgrade system. It is so broken and makes the game impossible to play without paying money. I'm level 37 and have aquired 6000 gems. I have spent 4800 of them upgrading guns and the other 1200 in the traders van. I have spent almost 100$ on this game and just BARELY gotten by. I hope u fix this pg3d."", 'This game is really addicting and it\'s also really good and btw, I would give this a lot of stars if you guys can like, Add a option to trade, And the game is not balanced, Like seriously It\'s just not balanced! It\'s not about the level, It\'s the loadout and gameplay, The feature for this, Is ""Progress Scanner"" It record one of the matches if you think you got better or the enemies are too easy, Then there\'s the progress, The progress counts how much your good at the game, Hope u like the idea.', ""This game is amazing and so much fun but I rate it 4 stars only because the prices on the guns are way to expensive I mean you can grind and all of that but still I think gems are a bit easier to get now. 1000 coins and more but you get like 5 coins in a match so that's gonna take a lot of matches all I'm trying to say is that you need to lower the price of these guns especially if the other players are free 2 play"", ""Dear PG3D developers... PLEASE add a refund system for the gallery. Since you can't even remotely test a weapon before buying it, it's really hard to tell if it's usable compared to... other weapons. Assuming this is read and taken into consideration, pretty sure no one would mind if there was a cool down for it and a limited time before a weapon can't be refunded, but I really like to use weapons I don't see and I'm constantly disappointed with what I get.Thanks for reading."", ""This game is really cool. I only have a few things I'd like to change. One of these things would be to fix the messages in the clan. Every time I'm in the lobby it says I got a new message in the clan and when I check there is no new message. This isn't a serious thing but I'd like it fixed. Another thing would be to make the guns and armour cheaper. I think they are a little expensive."", ""I think this is a great game because this game has a lot to do in it like racing and battle royalty.Also u can customize your character in it with the custom skin and there's a lot of events that happen like 2xp and 50% off on some guns but I think that they should make some more guns in this game but anyways I thinks is a 5 star game for that."", ""This game has on more than one occasion completely erased all of my progress and data, forcing me to start out fresh from bottom level without my consent. This means that all the time and money I've spent on the game is completely gone with no hopes of getting it back. The developers never address not attempt to communicate with their player base, even more so when the players are facing an issue and need help. Do nOT play this game, do not spend money on it, this game is a straight out sCAM!!"", 'This game is amazing! Theres just one problem, when we make characters sometimes the feature that makes both arms the same can be a pain like when you wanna make them look different. I could be absolutely wrong so please tell me. Have a nice day! ;3', 'The matchmaking in this game is really bad. Im a level 34 and i go against level 50 who can easily one shot me. With that happening, it is really hard to level up, get coins, exp, troph. I mean i have to rely on mini games and co-op which is not what i want to play all the time. Please fix your matching making system it is really frustrating. Update: now i am level 36 and it just get worse, now there is pretty much a zero chance for me too win any match except co-op and fort', ""The game is so epic and I love it and it's fun and I'm addicted to it not really but yea and it is so awesome and you should really get it because it's really fun and It is really cool and I love it and I think I already said that but it is the second best game ever and I think everyone should get it because it is like really cool And now I am running out of letters so bye."", 'Its have a cool graphics,so many guns,and nice player but the guns are too expensive.its need to be 1 victory=5 coins not 3.pls read this pixel gun 3D DEVELOPER.And also the GB needed is so high my memory is full now.And the skins is so expensive too and the upgrade.PG3D now is pay to win but i still play it pls fix this.But thz cause the updating is kinda fast i wish it could be more fast than now.But the installing is so slow and if its done it gonna repeat again and again every updade fix ths', ""A true classic. Controls are a bit difficult to master, but once you do, it's THAT much easier.

First , they made the ' predator ' gun fire way slower and make that amazing 650$ shotgun lose thee fast firing ability that allows me to hit more enemy easier .

There are unfair one shots and all that. I still love the game though. Also, we dont need more 1 shot area damages!

It's a good game but whats the point in an option to watch an ad to double your coins only to press no and having to watch a 30 second unskippable ad anyways. Its ridiculous.

I enjoy playing the game but there are problems. The option to watch an ad to keep running is a joke. If I hit no I still have to watch an ad so I might as well watch it to keep running.

I spent about 5 minutes just retrying that specific jump to no avail. Veeeeery sloppy controls."", ""In the earlier levels, the game runs very smoothly and there are no issues with controls. However as the levels become longer and more complex (especially the later construction site ones and the Technology Park levels), the timing and responsiveness seems to waver drastically, to a point it almost feels like luck as to whether you reach the top of alternating wall-jumps.

Part of the difficulty is from the bad controls. Fix the controls, and I'll give it a 4."", ""I'm only uninstalling this because the controls suck really bad. I have some recommendations, instead of swiping, maybe tap in the middle to jump. And I think tap to the right to accelerate and tap to the left to kick the cop if he gets too close.

FOTONICA is simple, but is not easy: it follows a tradition of arcade games that are easy to pick up and almost impossible to master. A multi-layered level design across eight different tracks, together with a procedural endless mode make for a game that is incredibly deep. Think you can outrun your friends? Try the split-screen versus challenges. 

The visuals are a treat for the nostalgic player but also for those hungry for new aesthetics. Every pixel is drawn to convey the maximum sense of speed, an exhilarating journey through light and void.

- 8 Levels to explore and master.
- Plus 3 different endless levels to compete for high-scores.
- Two-player split-screen multiplayer mode on the same device!
- 18 Achievements to unlock plus game stats. 
- Online rankings.
- Beautiful, smooth, and unique vector-style graphics.
- Electronic music by Michael Manning, Nicol√≤ Sala, and legendary composer Baiyon.
- 2 Difficulty settings to let you play an even faster version of FOTONICA.
- Play in landscape or portrait mode.
- No ads, no in-app purchases.
- Record and share replays of your best runs.

It's amazing, I just love playing levels. But, Robtop, 2.2 should be here already. It's been so long. Come on. Now that I think about it, I actually don't care. Mobile lag. I can't do this much longer. It really limits what you can do on hard levels, and you have to adjust your timing for something so stupid that can easily be fixed. One level. I want to upload one level. Months. I just want to make a level for my buds to test. Error after error. Come on."", 'All I am asking for is there to be a way to get your levels back when you delete them because I was working on a level and I accidentally deleted it when working on the description.

Yea, the updates take too long, but that's good! It helps sharpen your skills before the update with a bunch of new stuff! This game is SO fun, and those 2 bucks that I spent on that was worth it, because this is number one of my favorite games!

Thank you RobTop for creating this wonderful game."", ""It is a good game but it sucks as well because my phone makes it clip so I cant jump or dash or anything for a split second and the game is all about jumping at the right moment and my phone just doesn't seem to want to do that, but everything else about the game is great!"", 'Best game; has trouble loading sync data when you download the game on a new device however. I found that if you uninstall the game and the download it again it seems to fix the error. Still, great game, fun to play with your kids and really helps to establish hand eye coordination for the little ones; at the same time the older ones are able to learn how to use their creativity to build their own levels, icons, etc. Highly reccomended!', 'Ok i know i had gave this a 3 star before but that has changed. This game is amazing! Its really fun actually. it can be frustrating but thats what keeps you playing! Its always fun to go in to the level editor and show others how you create, and the main levels are such a great way to introduce you to new mechanics. Just have patience and play through the game, youll love it! This game is incredible if you actually stay put and try. 5 stars rubrub. Thank you for this wonderful game!', ""This game takes time to master. It's easy to pick up, but levels start to increase in difficulty. Hours turn into days of trying to complete a level. That also makes this one of the most rewarding mobile games. There's only a few problems I have with the game mechanics such as auto jumping and unresponsive clicks. Great game overall. Oh, and Kara, don't give this game a one star just cause you suck ass."", ""It's an exceptional game, it's disappointing that it isn't being updated now... I have seen people writing reviews saying that it's bad because of its difficulty, however the game is made to be frustratingly difficult, so that makes them reviews useless. It's a good time killer and I would recommend to anyone who wants a challenging game to play."", ""I like geometry dash. It's challenging and simple. I mainly spend my time creating, playing levels online, or being competitive with friends. A major issue I've had is the lack of updates. I understand the developer is still working on this, but I have trouble frequently playing this without having anything new to do"", ""I like the game but I play on mobile so I dont think this happens to everyone. Sometime when I tap it doesn't jump/ring jump/ go down in ball or spider. Also when I'm testing my level and I press the button in the corner(the one that let's you save and exit) to stop testing I cant move the screen and place anything meaning that I have to go out and go back in.

When you get bored with playing levels, you can make your own level in the level editor. There is unlimited entertainment in this game.', ""The game is broken! Every level is impossible, including the ones that are not even close to the hardest difficulty! I barely stand a chance on this, and I'm having second thoughts on buying the game. Would have deleted it by now, but that would be wasting money on nothing. So I'm stuck with the game. The game just punishes everyone who buys it and it's unplayable.

The hitboxes could use a tiny improvement, controls on touch screen are good, I assume it would be played better with a controller since a touch screen is usually small and in a dungeon game like this you'll need joysticks to turn and move faster.

Hard to get these right on a touchscreen for fps I know so can't knock ya."", 'It\'s a great game, however, I really hope the newer features of the PC version eventually make it over to Android, like the breakable crates and the chunkier cave structures. Additionally, an option to use the Android ""immersive mode"" would be nice. I\'d gladly donate if such improvements are ever implemented, and hopefully I wouldn\'t be the only one. I bought this game twice, once on Steam and once here, and since I no longer have a PC I\'m hoping the Android version hasn\'t been abandoned.', 'Great game very fun. Cant wait to see where the game goes. I would suggest putting the toolbelt on the bottom of the screen. Hard to fight and switch weapons. And something like a flame arrow to light up corridors down the way. Or change the brightness of the game. would like to be able to play the game somewhere other than a cave or in the corner of a dark room. I have several other ideas but its not my baby. Excited to see where Delver goes. Oh and when you level up it is forcing me to look up until imove']"

THE SETUP
-------------------------------------------------
Welcome to Shibuya, a mishmash of attitudes and styles in the heart of Tokyo.

A boy named Neku wakes up in a crowded intersection, alone and unaware of how he got there.

THE PAYOFF

Activate your combat abilities, or ‚Äúpsychs,‚Äù with simple touch commands like tapping, slashing, and dragging. Comfy with that? Control Neku and his Game partner on the same screen and take the combat up a notch. Like loot? Boost your item drops in battle with the revamped Fusion system.

‚úî Deep replay value
Finish the main story to unlock a hilarious bonus chapter, more quests and items to find, new combat challenges, and secret reports that flesh out the story even more.

‚úî Explore a living, breathing city
Neku‚Äôs sprawling world is based on the real-life Shibuya in Tokyo. Visit real locations and absorb some real Japanese culture through a hip, fantasy lens.

‚úî Exciting arcade action

I've never played Garou until my friend mentioned that I should try it out. I found it on mobile here and it is fantastic! Best $4 I've spent in a long time.

But still one of the best fighting games I've played"", ""Hands down the best fighting game port on Android. I've been trying out many of the ports available on Android and this one is by far the best. Great graphics, smooth gameplay. I'm not a big fan of touchscreen controlls on ports like these, or any on screen buttons for that matter, and you really aren't getting the full experience unless you get controller. These games where built for those. But then again, if you're a fan of fighting games that's nothing new for you."", 'This game is incredible. It has beautiful graphics, a genuine story mode, nice background scenarios and a really good game play. The game play actually feels really smooth. The game does have deep mechanics. Each character for instance has a move that can be cancelled and can be combined with a super or combo. Characters also have feints, a taunting move, which can also be used to string certain hits or moves and thus do long combos+desperation moves or even implement cancels. This game, along with kof 98, is on my top 3 fighting games list. I personally use the touch controls of the screen. Sometimes they become unresponsive but the issue can fixed by swiping the top screen with your finger.', 'Good game. Very easy to pick up and play, recommended to anyone.

Not only have the graphics been optimised for android but the controls too. Whilst there's nothing feels as good as blutoothing a controller, I appreciate that the team porting this gave mobile users, and on the go gamers, the option of new buttons to make up for the touchscreens lack of speed and responsiveness. SF pay attention this is how you port a top fighting games."", ""It's a great fighting game to play on android for sure but the lack of remapping and adding button on the screen makes it a hassle to play without a controller. C+D is necessarily to play it fully and there's no button that combines those 2 which is a reoccurring issue on every fighting game port for the Android. The lack of online multiplayer is also a big downside. I hope you update the game at least to add the C+D button to the on-screen controls."", ""Need to improve on the super combos but besides that it's epic."", ""I love most SNK fighting games including this one during the good ol' arcade times.

Introducing Diamond Dark Fate TERMINATOR, the 1st ever mobile BRUTALITY, Diamond ASSASSIN SKARLET, a new brutally difficult LIN KUEI TOWER, and 10 new pieces of Lin Kuei Tower Equipment! Reach the top of the new tower to earn a Diamond Sub-Zero card and Kuai Liangs‚Äôs Scepter and Bracers needed to perform the first BRUTALITY. We‚Äôve also redesigned the back of character cards, added a MK11 Stadia link, and crushed more bugs.","['Hello there, hope you are all doing good. I love the game, play it every day since its released, really enjoy it. However, sone of the challenges, sometimes, does not worth it. Lin Kuei tower, which just finished, seriously is not worth the effort at all. I finished it and the price is not what you expect for the effort, since the bosses are incredibly difficult to kill, need days, literally DAYS to pass them. Hope you can do something about it. Thank you, have a nice day.', ""Previously gave this game a bad review but I just unboxed the dark fate terminator and I gotta come clean. This game is pretty good for a free to play mobile game. The graphics hold up and the game has plenty of content. The controls are simple enough yet lack any tactical play. The in game store is a little high priced for a mobile game but to be honest I've never spent a dime and I have almost 80% of the characters. Wish they kept the sub zero tower around longer though."", ""The game is a bit tedious and works very similar to all combat games in a team format. Getting new cards is based on souls collected by completing tasks. Finishing moves are limited to Diamond cards and won't be given to you even if you purchase a Diamond soul pack. Happend to me twice. In Battle mode you may grind to a halt, as the game designer prevents you from blocking. In all, the game is gun for a short time but don't expect it to be anything like MK2."", ""I love the game, except for the difficulty of some of the towers. Every since I got MK11 Sub-Zero's health to halfway, I been stuck on 110 on the Lin Kuei Tower. It doesn't matter who I get. Six punches and my whole team is finished. I can't block ANYTHING from him. C'mon now!! I don't mind a challenge, but that's ridiculous. I can only imagine 200 on the tower. Also, can you get some new players!? Shang Tsung? Stryker? Sindel?"", ""Horrible customer service! !!! But other than that it's a very fun game my wife and I both enjoy playing, even though they are quite stingy with their epic drops. It is now a pay-to-play game,meaning if you want those epix you have to pay to get them you will not get them in the Lin kuei Tower. Previously you worked in the game to level up and never had to spend cash. It has great graphics it's easy to play fun yet also frustrating as you can't get the characters you want or equipment cards."", ""the game is great, it's pretty fair if you spend your souls wisely, I've spent a little money cause I wanted to support the game not because it pushed me to it and that it's remarkable good for a free to play game, highly recommend for F2P players who are patient and can set goals, Lin kuei tower was difficult but that's the essence of mortal kombat pretty good job from the devs on that challenge. Hopefully we will have similar challenges in the future."", ""Where is all the stuff I worked so hard for? I haven't been able to play in a while, and I finally got to reinstall the app, I sign into my wbplay account, and it still has me starting from the beginning. Also it will not restore my game data in the settings menu anymore. I used to live this game, but if I'm going to lose all the time and money I put into it, I'm just going to uninstall"", ""This game used to be good. Now you no longer can choose which characters to buy and you have to spend thousands of souls with a very slim chance of getting something useful. The Lin Kuei Tower challenge is impossible to beat even with the strongest fusion level X diamond cards, so don't even dream of getting a diamond Sub-Zero for free! It cannot get any more frustrating than this!"", ""Everything is well and good in this game but the game UI has to be improved, it doesn't start, it crashes though my phone has an 845 processor the loading screen takes a lot of time and sometimes the game doesn't start at all and during the fight it lags, there are a lot of bugs to be fixed and rest all the gameplay is very excellent, if you fix this problem I'll rate it 5 stars for sure"", ""This is a great fighting game and a solid adaptation of the console version. The graphics are amazing, and I'm glad they have special attacks for each character. My only complaint is that it is too difficult to get diamond character cards, and you often need to spend money to get them. Fatalities are good, but not as common as I would have liked. That is my #1 issue."", ""I absolutely love playing mk 11. The graphics and movement is fantastic. I've been playing for a few months now and I just want to suggest that you should have a spot where a listing would show people online playing and to be able to connect with friends and family for head to head fights and or tournaments. This would add another dimension of game play. This game is awesome and I hope you give my suggestion consideration."", ""love playing the game, been playing for almost a year now. after the last update it's been running slow, loading the game initially as well as pack openings. and pack openings are my biggest complaint. I have emailed on 3 separate occasions now. I dont see how the gold packs are randomized at all. I have maybe 12 gold cards that are maxed out. over the last 75 gold packs iv bought (150souls) I have got a maxed character at least 55 of those packs. other than that ridiculous issue, good game."", 'You know I really love this game, I really do. It has the controls and the graphics that any mk player wante on a mobile. I wish that you can add two things to make this game the best ever in mobile gaming history. Th first is adding guilds and making these guilds have wars between each other. The second thing is to enhance your story mode make a story of it keeping it like that seems dull, bring life to it. Thank you for your work and bug fixes. We ( mk players ) will always show you support.', ""Excellent graphics, the fights are very intense, I like the backgrounds when playing Im giving you 2 stars now, i uninstall the app because i have to record videos, and then when i erase all the videos i make, i have clean 5 GB of storage, and the same thing, can't install the app, what a great update you make right -_- Edit: installed, thank you for fixing this issue, you have my 5 stars now ;)"", ""I have played this game for five years now and, well it does suck that we need internet now, but at least it will let u play,.well not always there has to be a specific place that I have to go to in school for it to work, but rather than that, it is one of the most coolest games I have ever had thanks to my older brother that showed it to me, but anyways. It's not the worst , since well I now have 76 characters, and well I hope the next update won't be as bad as it is ."", 'This game used to be great & fun without having to dump tons of money into it. Now y\'all offer challenges that you can\'t complete unless you have certain characters maxed out. The only way now to accomplish that is to spend a bunch of money buying souls to buy card packages that only give you a card you already have & have it maxed out. I just used 7,000 souls to buy cards & never once recieved any of the 3 cards that you\'re ""supposed"" to have a chance of getting. Huge waste!', ""I thinks the graphics, movements and everything is going excellent! But there's just 1 problem I seem to be having, I have great Internet connection I can play other games and YouTube but I seem to can't play Mortal Kombat. I'm not sure if your games broken or is it just my wifi dosent want me wot play, but still keep on your work on making MK 12,i hope to see even better graphics and movements! I'll be playing!"", 'This game used be to be so great when it was known as ""Mortal Kombat X"". Now, it\'s terrible. Not only do the packs have low drop rates now, but the character store is trash. Why can\'t we buy what we want anymore? Instead of choosing, we have to wait quite a long time for something we want to actually show up. I also loved being able to see my favorite character whenever I logged in on the main screen. Now we can\'t do that anymore either. I hope you guys will consider changing things back...', ""The update for when some cards got changed to diamond lost my interest there. You can't promote any one you want. You have to wait for it to come out in the store. And I don't reckon some of the diamonds deserve to be diamonds. I don't like it when it changes rarity. Just really lost my interest"", ""A great game for a mobile version . I had played mortal kombat x at my PC and it was just amazing . I was expecting that the mobile version would be around 3 to 4 GB but you made this game under 1 GB. Its totally surprising and awesome . All around it's a great game ."", ""Its amazing just because of how the creator's make or put the right equipment or character in the game or like if your trying to get a character you need but its in the character menu where they have them for 450 or 250 souls an the card packs are great too but in my opinion getting a card pack is like saying im gonna win the lottery your never guaranteed a diamond or even mk 11 diamond so to me the diamond packs are a waste of souls but subtract that portion of the game an its really cool."", ""I've been playing game since 2016 the new tower challenges that have been released after tower of terror are way to difficult . Why spend hundreds or more when people can buy the console game for $60 . I know the company has to make money to support the game to a point and employ people but .. . Please adjust the tower challenges to be easier so more people can enjoy the game including me ."", ""Good storyline, but mutiplayer is so random, you are level 1 and you're gonna be put against levels 60. Really bad mutiplayer system. And I don't reccomend buying the packs, it reads DIAMOND pack, but you get GOLD characters, and you can't even claim your coins back, you won't get them. Controls response are really laggy as well."", 'I WAS enjoying this game for a long time...until I had to use a new Android for it. All my progress, GONE. And WB Support was utterly useless. Now I have to start from square one with crappy fighters and no chance of getting back to where I left off. Thanks a LOT.', ""I came back and things sill the same... cheaters and hackers anywhere. I just played with a hacker called TonyPRO that already charged Kabal's Fatal Blow in less than 20 sec without even taken dmg. Guys, when are you going to solve this issue? It's annoying and the most phatetic thing to lose against someone who does not even know how to play. I can't continue playing like this, sorry guys, but you just lost one of your best fans. I'm out"", 'Excellent and fun game, but 1 v 1 would have been better. Although I am disappointed that there is no story mode. The game is made very plain and when there is no story it becomes boring. I hope it would be developed and be similar to the ACTUAL console game.', ""Edited review. Please please fix the login issue in this game. Even if the internet is running at around 20 mbps still then it becomes difficult to log in every single time. I have already made lot of purchases inside this game. Please fix the log in issue. I don't want to uninstall it. I repeat plz fix the log in issue."", ""The Game would be perfect, except it freezes as well as has glitches when you play it on smaller, cheaper phones, and not necessarily less storage-space phones. It also seems like the better I do and try to do, the Game will not let me. It's weird and odd. I also think I'm right and have a great point to what I'm saying, that must be why y'all have to keep on Updating it. Also, some Characters aren't as strong, fast, and just plain good as They should be, such as Sub-Zero, and Lui Kang. Daryl D."", ""The app needs grid internet to get started not 4g connection. It takes ages to load up the game. If you try 10 times, you will be successful once it twice, half my phone's battery is drained in loading the game. There's no way to track how much time is left to load the game, a same usual music with a hovering circle keeps playing. That interest and enthusiasm of playing is only destroyed at bootup We don't live to play this game only, when we get a call the app crashes immediately."", ""Good graphics, well-adapted game play for the phone, and not hammering you with ads. Unfortunately, over the last few months the developers have been making substantial, and ill-advised changes - fighting mechanics, new and interesting attempts to monetize the game - and judging by the amount of glitches, doing it poorly. It's becoming less and less fun - i can't imagine what starting out fresh is like now."", ""I really like to play this game. It has a lot of action with awsome fatalities. But the only thing is it's quite hard to get souls and there is very low chance of getting a diamond charecter from packs. I think there should be atleast one more way to get souls or the chance of getting a diamond charecter must be increased. Please work on it. Thank you"", ""DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME!!! The game is ridiculous. You can't block anymore. The AI immediately attacks after you've been knocked down and the only thing a player can do is wait until the AI is DONE. Lin Kuei's tower is a waste of time. Sub Zero will hit your characters 3 times each and you're done. The game is garbage. I'm out. Also, look at the % for the packs before you pay money. It's a con. You'll never get the players they're advertising on the packs."", ""I like the game, it has some flaws however I would recommend to many people.But a little problem that I have right now is that I'm trying to connect my game with my gmail account so my game can save. I played the games for.a year before but I got bore of it and uninstalled it but nownI wanted to play it again and my progress didn't save I have been trying to connect my new game with The WBplay center but it keeps saying that my account is invalid, I even made a new gmail account."", ""Game used to be great fun, even with all the money the devs try to get you to spend. Problem is one of their updates caused game breaking bugs for me and when trying to reach out to the support team I've been passed around from rep to rep since October! And now they just ignore me! I know im only one person, but they just don't care about their playerbase unless your talking $$$! Time to uninstall!"", ""*sigh* great game but the card packs are a bit overpriced. Its completely free to play, it's not too frustrating, I do well in it. These guys do listen to its players (as of today they are fixing some bugs that have been addressed). Please balance some of the characters, don't pair up a gold team with a completely diamond one. How does your matchmaking work anyways? It's not actually player VS player, so what's the harm in lowering prices and handing out good characters every once in a while?"", ""Good game but I liked it when u could choose your own characters to purchase. I don't like wanting 24hr until they only give u 3 to choose from. it never be the character u want. Also they're should be some time when xp is double or something to help u build characters up. once they hit 30 it's extremely difficult to build."", ""I really enjoy playing this game its my favorite game on mobile but it's really frustrating to get a diamond card I mean I open like 10 packs at times but still don't get a diamond I really hope on the next update you guys can make some changes atleast give us 100% to get a diamond card maybe for 800 souls or so that would make the game more enjoyable for the die hard fans"", ""This is one of my favourite games. I love this game. But i can't give it 5 stars because of linn kuel tower. At battle 40 you face sub-zero grandmaster. One problem is, if he uses hos ice decoy and you fail to kill him in the same round, he'll keep on using ice decoy, which is super unbalanced. I have been stuck there for a week because there isn't that many ways of leveling up. So i'm just stuck there."", ""Game is fun, but requires you to always be online. Which wouldn't be too bad if it would let you log in. Couldn't log in in 2 days now. Other online games like Pokemon go work with my wifi. This game has some really bad connection issues. Works on mobile data, but consumes too much data for my taste. So I cannot play it. Fix log in problems and connection issues and the game will be good."", 'I enjoy playing this game, the challenges and the characters. But I have given this app a 1 star rating, because I does not log me in, everytime I try to open it. I have constant 4G network coverage with plenty of data, yet it keeps telling me, that data connection is required, yet I have full network coverage. This needs to be fixed...']"

The one with the chance of getting the punisher? Yeah that one sucks, because all you receive is gold, EVERY TIME, üò§ it's infuriating and it really gets a person's hopes down. Pls fix."", ""Great game to play very, very time consuming. But one thing is if you want to get far in the game you have to waste so much time playing and kinda farming and playing more to get far and sometimes you have to spend money on this game from time to time to get some where slightly worth it kind of. But if you don't care about all that, then if you really want to succeed then you have spend most of your day playing it doing stuff to progress and you have to spend alot of money I'm mean alots $100's"", 'Happy player here! I have been playing MCOC since October 2019 (not sure, somewhat..) and I am addicted to it. The designs are fantastic and satisfying.

Please reply to this"", ""Honestly I play quiet a few games. All different types. From slots to castle clash to marvel. This particular game is in one of my top favorites. I like it cause it's not a full pay to win. It gives plenty of upgrades to keep moving where you dont get stuck but the levels are pretty tough. It's a very interactive fighting games so if you win or lose it's pretty much on your ability to play.

You should get a six star character for keep updating, spending over $100.00,should be just as easy to get six star as it is to get a one,two star', ""This game raises my blood pressure. I deeply resent the luck-of-the draw mechanic for obtaining new fighters - I'm drawing at the 5-star level now, and of the nine I've collected, all but one is among the very worst champions in the game, as rated by the highly active online community. There's no option to trade or improve the game's bad champions in any meaningful way, meaning that if you draw poorly, the game's mechanics will require you to spend severely limited resources on ranking them up to improve, meaning you won't have these resources to spend on better champions further down the road. While the RNG is the worst factor, it's still a fairly mediocre game in other regards. The fighting is bland and repetitive. The art feels like it should be better, for a game based on comics. The one stellar element of the game is the animation rendering - if there's a prettier fighting game app, I haven't seen it. If you're into guilds, you may enjoy the game's Alliance feature."", ""Very fun game but do not give them your credit card info. I was charged $50 for some reason and they will not even communicate with me about what I was charged for!

When I contacted support for help they immediately close the case. No communication, no explanation. Completely unprofessional."", ""I haven't been playing this game for long, but from what I've seen it is very well made. I love Marvel, and the game itself doesn't take up much space. When I first started the game, the storyline was quite confusing, and not truly straight forward, and storylines are always a big part of the game to me personally. As I played more the storyline became clearer, but not all the details are straight forward to me yet. This is a highly recommended game if you want some action and good controls."", ""Support is horrible. Returning player from almost 5 years ago and they erased my name and won't let me create a new one, so that means no friends list or allegiance.

What's the point of playing if I can't even add my friends on here??"", ""Don't bother with it their customer support it garbage.

One thing that would make it a little better would be to add a mode where you can play offline so all of the lovers of this game can play it even more', ""Fun at first, but it gets to a point where you literally cant beat a character in your quests because the opponent has 'death immunity' and 'indestructible' so no matter how hard you try you cant win. Happens randomly with different events so it isnt even a regulated thing you have to overcome. It's just there to mess you up. Also the difficulty gets 1000x more difficult after the 3rd chapter so you can only advance if you spend money or spend 8 hours a day farming catalysts."", ""This game is the most wonderful ‚ù§Ô∏è game I have ever download in years. But I don't know why if you are a beginner it automatically gives you some alliances which I don't like. But after all it is really great. If you download this game you will never regret it, the graphics are perfect, the marvel players, chatting with others around the globe, this is awesome. But don't forget it uses data but not much. I wish you guys can bring an offline place so you can fight with the computer."", ""Marvelous game. A must have for marvel fans. Plenty of rewards. The devs regularly update the game and release new stuff. There's tons of content and things to do and thousands upon thousands of people play this game. Although you can spend money on there, you can still be f2p if you grind. I've played loads of mobile games from clash royale to mk mobile but all have been taken off just so I can focus my spare time and a little bit of extra cash on this game"", ""The game itself and a lot in it I very much enjoy. I used to play a while back and I enjoyed it, and that hasn't changed. When you play this, however, you'll have to know what to grind; don't complain about not getting good champions after some time playing. After all, Global will usually give you a decent tip (Alliances, folks). You don't have to pay to get far, it just takes a little longer. A bug here and there, but nothing too raunchy."", ""I've been playing this since 2015. I may have been this game's biggest fan but I had to rate it at two stars because I've been trying to download the latest update for two days and haven't had any luck. And I know it's not my wifi or my cellphone network because it lets me do literally everything else but download the latest update. Please fix this."", 'The game is great but its just another mobile money pit and they will take advantage of you wanting to progess in the game. Lol Credits and things are over priced Kabam in no way cares about the people playing this game far as loot drops . Characters will be unbeatable and try to force you to use credits to progress. Rewards need to be better and it would be perfect', ""Do you like spinning slot machines that simply change to the losing/lowest winning combination? Everytime you play. Enjoy this game. You can spend hours and hours on this game but you won't get far simply because the reward system is just persuading you to purchase the boxes."", ""This is the best game in all the places that exist I pray that you make more abilities and skill for the characters in this game and make it so you can run around in the contest and hack into Iron Man's suit. Please don't be rude about my comments on this game , its a coplicated update if you do update the game those who dislike my thoughts I understand I forgive you but maybe you could it so you move around easier. Please answer, Legendary ninja~7"", ""Loading takes forever. I can't even play the game now because of how long it takes for the loading screen to finish loading, and every time there's an update, which is a lot of times, the longer it takes to load, so now I can't even play the game, and It takes about more than a half an hour four the loading screen to finish, and it's awful."", 'Great game.

Congratulate those who created this game what i like about this game is the fact that they made super heroes exactly as they are in movies and i like how the idea was placed with the crystals that gihe you super heroes once again congratulations and i hope to improve little game graphics !', ""The game is great , it's fun and it's time killing. But the 1 problem I have is that it's really hard to gain good champions. It requires an absurd amount of grinding and by the time you get a premium crystal, it's a 2 star. If the chances were a little but better the game would be really good üòÅ"", ""Amazing gameplay. Support is pathetic. I'm level 23 and have only just needed to contact them. Spoke to two different people. They were rude, condescending, unhelpful, didn't listen to me AND told me I was wrong. And even if I wasn't they wouldn't be able to do anything anyway so I should just shut up and leave it be. Not impressed."", 'I have been playing this game 1652 hours over 5 years and spent about $750. It comes down to crystal pulls to progress. I earned Cavalier title and have spun crystals even after spending $ that are unable to help my progress, mostly losers. Buy something nice like 2 real consoles and several games instead. Buyer beware.', ""Playing it for years now ,I noticed for a few months and now again ,when I lose connection and I log back on 50% of my health is gone ,I need feedback asap or I'm going back in time to 2016 and continue DC's injustice ..I really enjoy this game but that one issue is truly frustrating"", ""This game is so Rig and the developer is a bunch of know good people's, because they don't let you get to unlock your champions, and because of that you cannot Rank them up, which makes it hard for you to win the fights. It's time for y'all to di better with this game and stop giving people 1 star and 2 star only they're useless."", ""I think that overall, this is a pretty solid game with great graphics for a mobile game. The controls are simple but allows for sufficiently developed combos, and allows for you to have to develop a skill for fighting. I've been playing for three years and I have enjoyed this game the entire time I've played."", ""EDIT: Since the game is running smoothly, as promised, I'm changing my review and giving this game 5 stars because it's very entertaining although there are things to improve. ------------ Since the last update I have to restart the game 2-3 times before having my first battle because the game crashes. Sometimes it recovers the battle I was about to have, but most times it doesn't even do that. I like the game but this issue is getting very annoying. Please fix it and I'll increase the rating."", 'This game was fun, still kind of is. They keep ""fixing"" problems but make even more when doing so. I understand that money must be made to keep the game going but now it is all about greed. They allow people to make multiple accounts and use ""bots"" to collect as many units as possible, so they can sell gifts (during event) at half the price equal units would go for. Then join alliances so said alliance can boost their event score. If you want to try the game, do NOT spend your real money!', 'The gameplay and moves are the best I\'ve ever seen for pvp multiplayer and single player Graphics could use some updates and maybe a free crystal. I really like the character called ""White Tiger"" from The ultimate spider-man series... Also there should be better rewards for perfect wins... Where ur character hasn\'t been even touched by another character or when health of ur character is 99%.', ""This game has gotten worse over time, I mean like (GAME OF WAR) bad. Lol At this point I play out of boredom and maybe to see a new character. Telling the app maker your issues doesn't solve anything. So my advice if you decide to play, is to never spend a dime on the game and don't get into it too much. 12-22-19 update, this game still is a POS. The only upside is playing with friends and seeing new characters. You really have no control over the game, when they want you to lose, you lose."", ""I love this game. I play it all the time. And to reply to RayanQuickRats, you can fight other people in alliance wars. I do have one problem though. And that's the Arena Crystal's. Every single time I buy one, it gives me gold. And I've most likely bought 100 in my entire time of playing the game. If you can increase the rate of landing on punisher, I'm pretty I'm not the only one with this problem, but that would be great. Outside of that this game is great."", ""I've been playing this game since I was in 2nd grade, it is a great game because you could collect characters and use them in quests , battles, and you can go through the events and versus modes with them. You could power up and gain more champions with iso-8 and crystals which is a fun addition to the game making you available to be better than others stat-wise. I never lost fun and interest in this game and it is incredible. So for me in my opinion, I would download this game immediately :>:>"", 'I enjoyed the game and the graphics, It wasnt as good as injustice two but had way more characters. I think that it is very hard to get 4 star heroes and above because they just want your money. But I like the game style and their is almost a different ability for each hero. So I think that you should get it, but dont play it alot it you dont want to spend money', 'I have played long enough to acquire the title ancient one 4 year old account. This company is a joke. I spent actual $ to revive my fighters & immediately after I healed them back up the game goes down for emergency maintenance. This happened as I was waiting for the fight to load in alliance war.

But, after some days when I started playing this game, I was so much addicted that I spent my whole day!!! Moreover it has everything what a RPG should have, I would like to say that this is the best RPG I have ever played!!! But there is only a problem, that is if we players were able to buy the epic gears and weapons with rubies, please put some levels to win rubies aswell!!!', 'It used to be a good game back before the Titan update I had to replay the game 2 times since I lost my account and I had mostly everything in the game. It has a good control mechanic not perfect but good and the graphics I guess they are just ""meh"" The characters could have more details in their clothing and weapons since most of them look the same. The problem that I HAVE IS THE FOLLOWING: The game is just a cash grab and the ads oh God the ads are the worst overall I give it a 3/5 stars', ""5 stars, I personally fight like this as well. And just playing this game of fighting another worthy opponent just gets addicting for meüòÅ, like I won't stop until I defeat my opponent. I love the storyline, the controls or easy...kind of like a controller, and the graphics are hands downüôå. Is there a third one?\U0001f929"", ""Well... I really like this game because it has a thing that inspires me to make a game just like this! Although MK and SF if almost the same it is free and MK costs money ya know and it also taught me a lot of defending skills. It is just so fun I.. I just can't stop playing."", 'Pretty good on the whole, but too many ads. Every single time you finish a match, there is an ad. Also, as you progress further and further, the gold/main currency gets more and more expensive. So I have a reccomend action, which every single time you beat a boss like lynx or hermit, you get an extra energy slot. Oh, and also make a countdown timer for the ranged weapon.', ""This game has really stuck with me. The controls aren't too hard to understand, yet there is a certain complexity to them. Most animations are fluid, and gameplay and the story is quite enjoyable! The fact that this game is still being updated (even if it's just bug fixes) even after releasing Shadow Fight 3 is quite surprising, but a pleasant surprise. Overall, great game, and I recommend this game."", ""Still a wonderful fighting game that I've known for a few years But I have one big problem that makes this rating a 4, The ads you have to watch after almost every match is quite annoying, I wouldn't mind but the loading is so Slow! It's irritating that you have to wait a minute or longer just to watch a mere ad and if you have no patience you have to exit the game and re enter; I have one suggestion please fix the loading of the ads! It's too slow but yeah that's all, still a good game though."", 'Its a fun game, but the thing is i get frustrated when i lose and when i want to do a rematch, i always end up running out of the damn energy. Take away the energy bars. Make it unlimited for gods sake. It takes 5 minutes which is SUPER annoying', ""This game is very good. It plays a good role in the technology. But some people, don't like the game. They play games like FREE FIRE or PUBG. They like to play games of action and games of 300 , 500 MB. They do not pay heed to this game. I like this game.

However, the last few days I haven't been rewarded for the offers I've completed and it says that there aren't any videos available. I would gladly and promptly give it 5 stars again if I can get some helpful suggestions... This game definitely deserves a 5 star rating so please help me help you nekki.Thx"", ""Well it's a very fun game, one of my favorites in fact but the energy runs out super quickly therefore a lot of the time I spend in the game Isnt battling, it is waiting like 5-7 minutes for the energy to fully come back and than after that you have like 15 minutes of actual playing. But it is still very annoying that it feels like the game doesnt want you playing."", ""Ok, so I love this game... but there's one small drawback, the energy. Either extened it or get rid of it in the the story mode. I'm also not paying $20 for it, because that's ridiculous. $10, maybe. Also, the ads. Sometimes they just buffer and don't play. Trust me, I've tried waiting, checking my router, everything!"", ""I've downloaded this game a total of 7 times in my life and every time i enjoy it lol. I love the shadow style silhouette of the characters yet having small details to depict them apart from each other. Plus a very good story for a mobile game, i love it personally. I still think it's one of the best mobile games out there."", ""It's a great game. I have played it for a long time and still its awesome. But can u gus add more achievements and also cut scenes? And the reason I rated 4 is because there is this small loading sign now and then and nothing happens just goes. I have to exit and get back in for it to disappear. Please fix it. Plus raid isn't working."", ""The game is great but what's the deal with the long loading screens? Just a year back, It used to run perfectly smooth and the loading screens were alright. Whether offline or online, the loading screens are just way too long. I request Nekki to look into this. Because of this problem, I'm not even able to inflict damage in raids. Also, The ad loader glitches out after every match and I've to wait like forever. It seems the developers have ruined a perfectly well made game"", ""This is the second time I'm playing this game but on a different device. After all these years the game is still good but only now do I realise this game was silly in many areas. The addition of throwing knives were overkill, having to upgrade the weapons so often per profile level and how expensive it increasingly got and how rare the gems were withing game play were painfully obvious because I wasn't as blinded by new game love like the first time. Still a good game to pass time."", ""Awesome it's a great game 100% love it and it's about a shadow man that's a warrior who fights others with cool weapons and you can get better armor the more you level up and get stronger and then you can fight underground warriors who have powers and are so much more stronger but you can level up more and beat them with great power overall it's a great game and great experience."", ""I hate the fact that when you're fighting an opponent you just stay there for like 2 seconds which is enough time for the enemy to attack you and when you're on the ground it's like you can't get up like your character will not get up for a long time it's annoying but other than that it kinda suck but I like it a little bit I'm not a hater tho but it's super annoying this is for shadow fight 2 and 3 specially 4 I can't even begin to talk about 3.

I hope gates of shadows gets a new shadow soon.', 'Gane is very exceptional, with difficult fights and gameplay turn around that keep the intensity going with the soundtracks in thr background, the only problem is that I get confused with which shadow is me leading to a defeat.

With a very limited amount of energy you have to fight very strong opponents for upgrades, just imagine how long it will take for you to fully upgrade something. It has a very unique gameplay therefore this game is never enjoyable."", 'Every time I finish a battle, ads try to pop-up. And that is not the issue. The issue is, it takes forever to load the ad. How am I supposed to play a couple of consecutive battles if every single time the game takes over 5 minutes to load a single ad? And no other things work when the ad is being loaded. Ridiculous!', ""I like this game very much. This game was interesting than other games I think that firstly it made in China I don't know but that game was superior game and enjoyable also.

This is so easily fixable but the game remains this way; I'm disappointed."", ""The fighting mechanics and animation quality are very good and the environment design are good and it's offline too, but to continue the other chapters will tell you to be connected with the internet for downloading the required files for playing them, I recommended to give it a try."", ""I want to update! It seems it won't work because of tye lunar new year update.the previous update was perfectly nice,but when the update in lunar new year,it become horrible...because when your upgrading a weapon,no notification will face out!

This game has some small problems but overall it's a good game"", ""The game keeps asking to download a new version everytime you advance to new level...whats more is it kind of forces you to download the update unless you don't get to enjoy the game"", 'Game still lag everytime frenzy enchantment activate, makes you mishit then you get hit by combos and die.

Also some players hack unlimited gems, charges, elixirs and health. May Eclipse now is a cheater. Ads takes too long to load, very annoying.', ""I feel like this is an amazing game its really fun but i do agree with alot of people that its really annoying when battles turn extremely difficult and you have to uppgrade all your gear to win and i don't really understand when im fighting shogun for his wepon its very easy but when i try to fight with the butcher for his wepon its rated insane when shogun was normal that kinda doesen't make sence to me but otherwise great game really fun"", 'Its amazing!

I love it', ""Really love this game but why There's no control to walk just like in the (PC) and it is really hard to get to our enemy or step back from them...please add the outfit from the real boxing (PC) such as the white pant and glove with red tiger,the green camouflage pant and glove,the black pant and glove with the orange blaze and others...i'm sure you deserve 5star if you did it for the next update"", ""Overall satisfactory control scheme and graphics for a free game, but suffers from sluggish controls and character movement, weird audio glitches, and an intrusive amount of ads that pop up at random. In fact, many times an ad would actually interrupt another ad, forcing me to watch an ad in order to watch an ad. I say the game is passable, but only just.

I absolutely looove how sweetly I can dodge punches and watch them fly by in slow mo. Following by an awesome counter. Best boxing game I ever played.

Terrible interface that every time you throw an uppercut you pause the damn game, if you don't end up closing the game on accident.

The reason that it's 4 star instead of 5 is because I live the game dearly but I hate that you have to wait to play, Then the gym and online mechanics are iffy. You don't need to be online to save your characters info and update it when it shows your stats on quick fight, Career and your character. Could be better"", ""It's with a HEAVY heart I have to leave just 1 star. This game looked amazing. If it weren't for the ads I would've dished out some hard earned cash for perks too but na, not with all these ads I'm forced to sit through inside of only 5 minutes of playing?

For a mobile game you can actually pick who you wanna fight with at least out of several fighters, even though not the big big stars. The gameplay is super solid and polished.

Needs improvement on multiplayer so i can actually play and show our ranking! Also little black squares pop up when im boxing and interferes with seeing opponenet.

PLS RESPOND ASAP cause i really love the game but this thing that I explained sucks."", 'My experience with this game was amazing i loved it eveything from the details in the fight to the graphics on everything but a few negatives were game time was restricted by your energy.

Is just irritating beyond belief, not to mention the rate of which the physics fail! To give an example when I swipe left for a punch the punch jerks into motion, but its impact fails and your character just rubs your opponents back. If these issues are fixed this will definitely get 4 stars.', 'has potential but unfortunately in my experience its a little too difficult. multiplayer is a little weird in the sense that people exploit broken mechanics somehow countering all my punches and staying at full stamina it seems. fighting a cpu is no better because they are very hard to connect with, they block almost everything, and counter punching doesnt work because 80% of the time they just instantly counter your counter which im sure is unintended.', ""What a joke.. I remember buying this game years ago when it 1st came out and it was ok for the time, but now it's just a free to play cash grab of a game.. what a waste of money and nothing back when it turned free2play, not even an email saying they were gonna run it into the gutter and turn it into a piece of üí©"", ""I like the idea of the game but the controls are such a turn off for me. Half the time you tap it doesn't register and even if you in the guys face and he doesn't parry hits don't connect. I respect the game and the concept.

Pls fix it!!', ""Nice ads good glitchy clunky moves and oh this is what I love the most, you're about to knock your opponent down and suddenly 3 miles of distance are created between the fighters which btw you have no control over because of course when has feet movement been important in boxing and this is REAL Boxing woohoo! Don't even think about online, the sync is horrible. What a garbage."", 'Its a good game very addictive and fun the only problem is when im playing the weekly tournament, when i win matches and get points for the weekly tournament the game doesnt save my points!

‚ìí 2020 MARVEL","['I really liked the game. Every thing is good and nice except for the graphics(eg: when iron man moves, the machinery that you can see moves. Like you can see it near the arm). The game has also lost its fun factors after the recent update. Earlier in the story mode, you were free to select your team, but now, you are stuck with iron man, captain America and black widow. Maybe you could remove this.', ""2 years ago, this game used to be considered as one of the best online mobile games. I'm really sad and disappointed at the poor direction the game is heading to, especially with its most recent updates. In terms of character & game design, this game is brilliant. Sadly, not much can be said about actual gameplay. The developers need to plan updates carefully before releasing them and should make sure these updates involve meaningful changes involving gamemodes, not just boring repetitive ones."", ""This used to be my favourite game ever. I played for hours every day. But then the updates started changing and I stopped playing often. I maybe started playing about 2 times a week for about 10 minutes. It started to get worse so I deleted it for a while and download again today and my god. They have absolutely ruined everything in the game. I'm not mad, I'm just disappointed. Oh wait never mind, I am mad. Just make the game good like it used to be, then I'll be back. Please,üòî Goodbye......"", ""Its a very nice game , i enjoy it playing. But the game won't let me connect to my Facebook account, whenever i click on connect to Facebook button instead of showing log in option it shows forgot password and creat new account page. Please fix the issue as i could not connect to my friends. Edit:- Thank u guys for resolving the Facebook login problem. 5 stars from me. Have a great day."", ""One of the few F2P games that actually gives away items to keep loyal players interested and able to keep up with P2P players. The developers are more than generous and if you're patient, the daily gems stack up fast! It's very possible to gain just about everything in this game if you put the time in and that's not saying one has to put in a ton of time. However, as with all things, there are ways to pay and get things faster but it doesn't impact the PvP aspects much."", 'Decent game but not free to play. You need to spend about 30 dollars a month. But reason for my low score is that as of a patch about 3 months ago the loading screens on several game modes went from 20 to 30 seconds to 2 to 5 minutes. This makes the game extremely annoying to play and I am calling it quits after waiting several months for them to fix.', ""Improvements need to be made to all the game modes. As it stands now we have 200+ characters in game but literally no where to use any of them!!!!! It's gotten to the point that the characters are the only content in the game that is really worth experiencing. Please allow us to use our characters in meaningful game modes with good rewards."", ""They completely destroyed the game with the 5.8 update. Players have been asking for new things to do for years, and all Netmarble did was nerf the top characters to make the existing modes harder so it takes us longer to complete them. That's not what we want! This is not a fix, it's lazy and manipulative. Netmarble only cares about money, not its player base, and I'm never spending money on this game again. AVOID"", 'Always disconnect from server. Come on!!! I pay for this game!! Fix it!!! It not bcoz of wifi. Coz its only happens to some character especially premium character (New review) Mode that should be improve is World Boss Invasion and Giant Boss Raid. This 2 mode always lagging and disconnect from server. Other mode so far so good.', ""This is (or was) my favorite Marvel game ever made, but the devs keep ruining it every update. taking away things I enjoy and replacing it with something I'll do once or twice and never again (ie. Story mode) I've spent a lot of money in the game which I never do, but they really need to start listening to players feedback. Make abx and alliance conquest better, fix the balance with older characters. Make bleed useful or get rid of it.. etc"", ""I've playing for a few months now and I love it, the character selection is constantly growing with the updates witch gets me excited to see if one of my favorites has joined the games universe. Only complaint is the character selection is small at the moment & focused more on recent characters but that's to be expected and I only hope that future updates bring more classic characters & costumes. The game play is also unique & fun in my opinion of course. One love all."", ""At this point feels like pure bait n switch, the changes to game modes and direct nerfs to characters after you spend money on them. Introducing rules then changing them 2 months later after ppl spend money....used to enjoy this game as of 2/12 update doesn't even seem like the same game anymore. Will not spend money on this game again due to these predatory practices."", ""What the heck is this new update?! The new way of playing the story is trash! You can't even choose your own characters! I enjoyed the old way much, much more. If you want to play a game where you do not choose your characters in the story mode and it has multiple modes this is the game for you. I only put 2 stars because this only applies to story mode on no other mode except legendary battle."", 'The game is decent enough but some modes are a boring slog or just broken and pay to win like timeline battle. But the one star is given purely for the fact the developers are utter liars and thieves. And just plain dont listen to the community. Example, i purchased something and never got part of it. I contacted support and they tell me their ""logs"" say i havent completed the content to unlock the stuff and received everything. Which is just a flat out lie. and they refuse to refund too.', ""Update 5.8 is terrible. It's a gamble game, everything is so random. I would prefer to spend 10.000 crystals to get the card I want than spend 670 crystals to maybe get a premium card or garbage. Please fix that, it's so frustrating. The same with CTPs, ccf drops, every chest, almost everything in this game is 10% strategy, ability and log every day, the other 90% are just luck or spend money. Luck is supposed to be 10% of a game! To play poker you need less luck than mff!"", 'After recent updates, the game has lost its fun factor. Most reviews have already covered the issues. One additional issue that I dislike is the removal of the option of one-handed mode. I can understand this being disabled in some game modes, but is another change in a long list of changes that have made the game far less enjoyable for me personally.', 'Tons of heroes, power ups/equips, and modes. Has depth, but the menus are terrible to navigate, terrible at teaching you even the basic or useful parts of the game. This game is complex and doesnt hold your hand at all, but while the system and mechanics being complex adds depth to the game which is great, the more complex a game is, the more advanced the guide should be to teach you. Maintenance times are long compared to other games I play like Duel Links, which is further irritating.', ""Please try to listen to the community. These new update changes have triggered a lot of players, go read some posts on the forums, people ranging from star agents , your big spenders to f2ps, complaining about the changes you've made by reading the patch notes. I love this game, but if you could just play your own game you would know. Nerfing the toons is worst. Even worse when the nerfed character is none other than Doctor Strange(most of them have ctp of rages). Please listen to the community"", 'New update ruins core mechanics of the game and makes it very unenjoyable. It takes away the hard work people have put into building up characters and makes favourite game modes unplayable. The so called improvements to game modes are not improvements at all and there is no changes to rewards which all players want. The developers are out of touch with the community and have ruined the game. 0/5 - Do not recommend', ""I have been playing this game since day 1 but every update, the gap between a whale and a casual player changes to point that it is necessity for you to spend real money, on top of that the devs even won't listen to the community, update after update the game becomes difficult making free to play players losing their interest unlike it once was. Good luck NETMARBLE, you'll going to lose a great amount of players in the game. Unless you'll reconsider to listen to what the community has to say."", ""It would be nice if you guys made an update where the new story mode & the older story mode were optional. This new story mode is not very fun at all. Takes to long per mission and your not allowed to skip those really long cut scenes. Also only being able to use Black Widow, Captain America, and Ironman sucks. I have all 3 of them maxed out but in stpry mode they're terrible"", 'Gotta say, downloaded this because Contest of Champions pissed me all the way off and off the bat 3 5 star heroes including one of my choosing and so many free rewards it was not only mind-blowing but down-right amazing. On top of that the graphics are superb, gameplay is fun, the banter between characters while you play is neat, and the story is quite good. This game surprised and blew me away great job Devs and thanks for giving us all the great free perks from the start seriously, thank you.', ""It's good game and has a lot of good quest. Only the last 2 or 3 update it's kind of controversial to the marvel comics fan and a lot of changes. May be the developer could evaluate more deeply on how to carried on this game to become a more accurate and fun gameplay, story, and character updates. Also, appreciates the hard work on adding new characters, but may be in the future you could be more accurate to the comics or at least made the characters more conforming. Thanks."", ""Thanks for the respond, I hope the dev team never do a things like that again. You should really fair, focus on new player and also veteran. In order to attract them you must make them feel comfortable with the system then they will have willing to spend. Don't trap new player otherwise this game will be death... And don't overreact to the whaler, I know they spend money a lot but without new player this game will not be expanding"", ""-This game is VERY pay to win,üí≤üí≤üí≤ -I dislike how some game modes/nodes are limit to 5 per day. That really sucks bc I wanna do more, in my opinion it shouldn't have a limit. -INVENTORY space gets filled quick and you have to BUY space, I have alot of things that are useless to me give us the option to spend gold to increase. Graphics ‚úî,Grind is üíØ, rewards not worth it. RNG ALWAYS WIN!!."", 'Not as much fun as it used to be... The game has been TOTALLY changed. All the missions are very hard to play and the heroes have become too puny. I do not get a sense of playing a super hero any more but it rather feels like I am playing a a weakling unit. In order to make it through missions one has to buy uniforms and expend money because there are so many stars and masteries for everything that there is never an end to trying to get your character to a decent shape.', 'Really nice games including features , moves , and characters it felt so realistic playing it . The game is of large download size but after playing the game I realized that my this much data was not a waste of time . If you are playing first time it will be a bit boaring because of dialogues but then after sometime it turns interpreting and then more and more....... this way the game becomes awesome I love playing this game so much and can t stop playing it once download this must have part --2', 'I love this game but as updates are coming the game is becoming more complicated and difficult as boss are very strong and level 70 characters available to defeat them but to rank up character many resources are needed which are very difficult and time consuming to collect When updating a character from sixty to seventy many resources are needed which are very scarce and time consuming to collect Its my request that game should give vast number of black anti matter etc', ""NM, you all are constantly ruining the game with these latest updates, the new story mode sucks and it is hard especially since we can't pick any character we want to play with. NM, another thing that really upsets me is that ya'll have been making characters available in the shop by us having to spend crystals in most of these recent updates such as Taskmaster, Viper and etc. NM, rewards are too difficult to win. Please go back to the old original method."", ""The game is literally unplayable for me. I have this glitch that says there are files downloading, which the game downloads, unzips, then‚Ä¶ repeats. I thought the new update would get rid of the glitch, but apparently not. And if you're wondering why I know the cycle doesn't stop; I've left it for over an HOUR to update, only to come back and find it stuck in the loop. Please fix this bug ASAP. I've been an off-again on-again player for almost 4 years now, and I'd hate to permanently quit."", ""Take my advice don't get it it takes up so much space I have a lot of space in my tablet I rated 1 star because it takes up too much space I get that they have to add it updates but still can someone figure out something that can lower the memory on the game like seriously why on Earth can someone figure out how to make a game which that can is high quality but takes up almost no memory k I have nothing against the game but can't Engineers figure it out please tell me someone can do that ok bye!"", ""I really enjoy this game style. This is the first MARVEL game that isn't turn-based, so I really enjoy this. Plus, there's the fact that you can change which character you play as, and let's just say that there's almost every hero in the MU. Very impressed!"", ""Tier 3 updrade is too difficult ... probably we need lot of time ...... a game in digital era must be not so long satisfy the player in less time .... genrally students doesn't have too much time to play the games ... at the tier2 I had to uninstall the game because I don't have too much time to spent with this .... I requests the developers to make changes in tier3 upgrade pattern...thank you"", 'I cant play story mode ever since the update. There is a time that im playingl story mode, then there is one mob that cant be killed. I exited the story mode and tried to continue but it always goes back to the scene where there is the stupid mob that cant be killed. Its always there forever.', 'after the change to the game modes the gameplay becamed more dull and boring. Most non meta games are removed, mods that allowed you to gather resourses like gold and tickets are gone to. This change made the game overgrind that i see no point because at this rate it will get closed faster then you can get all the heroes you want to the levels you needed.', 'Each update makes the game more and more garbage as the designers screw the players more and more. The boss fights basically are impossible as you do less and less damage as you should even with your most powerful tier 3 characters who are beefed up. The bosses are able to do random cut scenes which screws any actions the players already initiate. The bosses are able to do multiple one second kills out of the blue. You find yourself waiting for the game to even target the villians as you pound away at the keys. fail netmarble. fail.', 'Really really enjoyable. It never gets old. I really enjoy games like these because I love seeing how far I come when I sweep masses of enemies while taking virtually no damage. Really rewarding and satisfying and I recommend it.', ""Clearly made by fellow True Believers. 'Nuff said. I removed my 2 star review after they stopped forcing us to play Danger Room every single day. There were a few other issues that stemmed from that but they're a non-factor now. It's back to being an enjoyable game. There's even a new story!"", ""From 5* for literally 4 years and now down to 2*....i love the game and have had been playing for many years....but this last update kick a pain in the ass...i paid though...but this is too much for f2p's...there's almost no chances to keep up the events so forth...kindly lookout the forum, community voices to this....."", ""this good game used to work fine all these years but it won't work as of feb.12, 2020 on chromebook after the update.

I am not able to play anymore. It refuses to load after I did an update. Then I did the next update hoping it would be fixed... nope. And yet another update and no solution in sight. Dissapointed is an understatement when I dont get a response to my email enquiries.', ""Ever since the big update in November, the game has not been the same, the falling pigs go behind the sling and if you try to get them your bird disappears, can't fling a bird in star cup of you don't use power up, I deleted and reloaded the app and it's no better. No more zombie pigs or rare chests, please put the game back to how it was 6 months ago."", 'Very pathetic! When are you going to clear the server problem? Half the time the game is not opening.

Lost count how many times I've applied a boost during the game and it never actions and yet when I play the next game that boost has gone down by one unit.

This game is better than it ever was before, at least in my opinion. I just wish that more Angry Birds games could be like this. Keep it up, Rovio!

The tournament style gets old very fast and the ""online"" battles are completly rigged. Take for example the Star thing where you get 4 tickets to play. It says that you compete against other players but its just more AI. And the special slots that give you buffs and debuffs dont even apply to the AI. So you just end up getting beaten by 100,000 points because the game said so. Absolute bullcrap gameplay and gets old and repetative fast. Would not reccomend.', ""It is hard to play without crying.

The ads take up like half the game though, and some of them aren't even skippable which is kinda dumb considering each of them is about 30 seconds at minimum. Long story shory, it's a mobile game, but only partially a game."", ""This is a pretty awesome endless runner game! It's got it all: the power ups, boosters, daily rewards and a nice roster of characters. I do find, when playing online, the ads are a bit over abundant and it crashes on occassion. But regardless, I can't stop playing- I love it! =)"", ""Still to this day it's the best Casual experience ever! Nuff said! EDIT: Ok, so after a long time playing I can say that it's repetitive, not that is bad, but the first time you play it'll be the last time you'll play it in term of gameplay and what's changed. Oh yeah, and Limited Time Events that while some come back many don't, and that'll hurt the score to me..."", ""I was surprised to find out that this game was still being work on. While the core gameplay is mostly the same, it gives you a lot more to work with now with the included environment building (as i call it at least) and events featuring new characters and locations. I'm honestly glad that I redownloaded this game after 3 years"", ""When the game works, isn't showing ads after you die or killing you with cheap traps, it's a fun game that can feel a bit grindy. HOWEVER, the game constantly hiccups causing missed inputs, falling through the floor after making a jump, deaths after dodging a obstacle & breaking loop sequences (Camera gets stuck at end of loop). I rarely play this with an internet connection as its the only way to prevent ads from playing after death & there doesn't seem to be a way to stop them."", ""It's pretty basic so far, but challenging, and nostalgic enough to keep me going for now. I'm sad that I'm coming in at the very end of the baby sonic event and won't be able to get him, but the character selection is okay, definitely most of the main cast, but not as varied in the sonic universe as I'd like. All in all, okay. You guys made a passable runner, well done."", 'I\'m gonna give my honest opinion of Sonic Dash... I do really love it, and can see how it\'s improved over time. However, with good comes a little bad, and the bad being that you can\'t unlock other characters, unless you collect enough animals to finish building separate ""zones"" for each character. However, I do love how many characters are available in this game, so that small inconvenience is forgiven. However, it\'s still annoying.', 'I absolutely love this game if its offline. I love the online part of it also, the perks of being online makes it so much more fun than when its offline. What kills the idea of me ever going online through this game is the ad pop ups slow down the game so back it causes my game to freeze. This game works so much better offline. Other than the bugs, i love this game.', 'I remember why I unistalled it now. I go back, and after being forced to play the tutorial, I encounter a glitch -- this is literally like maybe two minutes in. It darkens the screen so you HAVE to hit whatever button they\'re so adamant on getting you to tap on, but when you do it\'s like, ""You have to go to this area first"". Um, okay, but how when everything else is greyed out, and I literally can\'t? Lol, I downloaded the game with intentions to play it, just to uninstall it 3 minutes later...', ""This is a great runner game for anyone who enjoyed subway surfers or temple run. In the beginning when it first came out, it felt like a serious cash grab as everyone in the game was rediculously expensive. But, it's recent updates have really improved it, as most characters can be warned over time. The courses with original music are pretty sick too! Great job on this one, Sega!"", 'Some obstacles are almost impossible to avoid. At one point I was on the lefthand side (to avoid the two tall obstacles to my right) with another two tall obstacles in front of me and I swiped right twice to avoid them but still collided with the middle one. What puzzles me is that both swipes must have been registered as I heard the swipe sound twice. Either this is a bug or the game is creating obstacles that may not be humanly possible to avoid. Camera angles make this even more difficult.', 'This game is really fun, better than the old version. Its graphics are amazing, the boss is really challenging for players who want hard mode. My most favourite thing about this game is that you can save pets and give them a home. I really enjoy this game and hope I never have to leave it', 'I love this game so much! I played it years ago but had to delete it because i needed space.This game has chaned so much! Althi wonder why you cant buy certain characters, its amazing! Although i would like it if you maybe brought down the prices of silver and those ones for the ring thingys because its almot impossible to get that many red rings without buying.', ""Probably one of the most addicting endless runners out there, sometimes I feel like the controls are not responsive? The level design can feel cheap in lot of places, and I'm bit disappointed that Green Hill is not based on the Green Hill from Generations, but Sky Sanctuary is. Otherwise it's a good time waster with our favorite blue blur"", 'wow. just wow. a decent running game, which would be a perfect fit with old school sonic and you ruin it by bloating it with as much advertising as you could. title page? adverts for the movie (sure why not). play a game? popups and adverts afterwards. and random ones that pop up just because. uninstalled because it wasted my time and broke my heart.', ""It's a fairly standard auto-runner/Temple Run clone but this time it actually fits the property like a glove. Very addictive but in a good way. Has a strong Sonic feel. Where it loses a star is for some characters locked behind a paywall and the graphics have been updated to resemble the movie more than classic Sonic. This leaves Robotnik and the Badniks looking a bit boring. Hope it's only temporary while the film is out."", ""Wow got baby Sonic a new one. So still moving on. Love to play,Didn't realize there were that many. So fun to play . Fun to play. I just keep going .Been playing for a long time!!!!! Yeah level 49 now. Guess it looks like this is the last level and got all the characters stared out so just playing to be playing. Lots of fun.Still going strong and fun to play."", 'This Game is A great game. A variety characters to unlock and event happen often. but I have a few things I want to be improve. First of all, the animations of character, please put more animations in,maybe some voice clips,different sfx for each character and please give unique expressions and animations to different members of the cast. Ideas= Silver gains his Phycokenetic Powers when dashing and glows cyan,Shadow activates Chaos Control turns red like in his own game Hedghog and Sonic 2006.', 'This is pretty darn good game! I do have my complaints, though, like not being able to get normal rings with just red star rings. In my opinion, in-app purchases should only be for premium currency (like red star rings) and bundles. Also, there should be another way to get gems besides achievements. Other than that, the game is really good!', ""One of the best free to play games out there. They handle their optional payment methods well and I've gotten all the characters i want in the game 3 times over the years without paying anything. If you don't have the patience for grinding you can throw a few bucks in"", ""This game is awesome but the only thing is that I want in the game is super sonic, no ads, and at least 1 hundred badges to collect baby sonic and movie sonic because then that will be awesome. It already took me 2 hours to get teen sonic and I know its gonna happen again with baby sonic because it always does and it's so hard. Still it's an awesome game and I really support the game because it is the best sonic runner game I have ever played..."", ""Very fun game and it is addicting. To be honest i didn't think i would like it because i really not that big into endless runners but ya this and as well as sonic forces( that was the game that hot me to try this one) are highly fun . my only gripe and ya i knownit it is to keep us playing but 500 token for teen sonic from the new movie is a little high"", 'I am personally really nostalgic for this game. But this game is just fantastic to play on the go. All of the new events for new characters always get me hyped about this game. I do feel like Sonic does belong in the endless runner type of games because it suits him, well lucky for you this is the game to play.', 'This brings back memories, to when I was 6, all the way to 12, this game still is addictive and beautiful, it lags a bit, probably because of the phone, but it still goes all out, creating dreams and fun for kids like me, thank you so much Sega, for all the loving memories you have given me.', ""The game is good, but it needs some more graphic update, for example on the new map they look kinda weird running, and the design it self of all the characters is kinda lacking, you can do way better, oh, and please, change Amy's running animation, it's truly awful, besides the graphics the game is great, please let's upgrade the graphics."", 'This is the best game that I have ever played when I was 5 till now! With all of these new events and new characters that keeps you wanting to play the game more!! Sonic has been a part of my life and I am very happy that Sega is working hard just to make us happy and have fun! Thank you Sega for being amazing!', 'Have been playing this for such a long time and it just keeps getting better. You dont have to pay to have a better experience which is awesome. The missions are not impossible and the gameplay is smoothe. Alsoo seems like the new update fixed the espio glitch that i was having so 5 stars for you. Good game', 'This game is absolutely amazing!It has amazing graphics and characters,it runs smoothly on my device and the graphics are of course beautiful to look at. And i quite enjoyed playing it so my rating is 10 out of 10 and would definetly recommend.', 'This game is awesome. This is the best running game ever. The controll is easy the graphics is fine the game play is good. My fav character is Teen sonic,baby sonic and tails. Give em a cheer of this delightful game. You should add a sonic dash 3 and put all the characters like hipster sonic,tails,teen sonic,amy and more il give this game 5 stars. Cuz i luv sonic games but not sonic.exe it gives me nightmares everyday when i play it.', ""I played a lot of this game years ago, and dropped off because of the little variety. I've come back to see that it's much improved. More backgrounds, more characters, graphical update, and just enough added complexity to the controls. It's a solid and enjoyable time-filler."", ""It's basically a reskinned version of Temple Run at its core, but fits well to the Sonic theme because arguably Sonic's quick step mechanics were first. It's fun, and expansions to the content over the past year have made it compelling to return to. Restoring the habitats of Sonic's tiny friends is surprisingly enjoyable even if after the first 4 areas the requirements get pretty extreme."", ""It's good! This game is a old time favourite for me! But I wish they made it easier when I come to getting the characters, still I think every kid should play this! It's amazing! And adding that it's hard to jump up on multiple things."", ""I think it's a great game and a time killer but I feel it shouldn't make you wait for a missions time to run out the reason is because it's an endless runner its gonna be bland quickly even with the events and it would keep you more busy and make you wanna play more but great game.

To overcome them you will have various aids, although sometimes they can hinder you work, as can be changes in the size of the racket or the speed of the balls multiplier balls, barrier, fireballs, gravity, change visibility bricks ...

Get in quickly, this event is a limited time only!","[""Great game. I remember playing this years ago and when I redownloaded I really enjoyed it. I have had it for about a month and now there is a problem that's making it really hard to play. Every other second the game freezes for a little under half a second and then continues and then freezes again, etc. I think this is a bug that will get patched and believe this is from the new update, but until a new update comes, don't download it because it is freezing far too often to make it fun to play."", ""The gameplay is just amazing! The fact that you gave us Gadgets and Power-Ups just made the game even better. Also, the events are just spectacular because you're allowing us to get exclusive stuff or even Items we need to buy so thank you for that. This is why I rate it 5 stars!"", ""This has gone downhill more than I could imagine... It's better to watch ads instead of actually playing the game, it takes time to go throu the menus, because of all the fancy animations wich take longer when there is an option to watch ads to continue or something and as soon as there's a update you are forced to uptate, so you can't use any older versions. The unly good things that have been added were the powerups and a few new backgrounds for the map, nothing else was added since 5 years."", ""I ‚ù§Ô∏è Jetpack joyride! It is the best game i have ever played! I love the fact that the game gets faster as you go further. I have just updated it so I didn't really get the chance to write about the new features. Anyways, BEST GAME EVER!!!!!"", 'This game is great! Id play it alot when i was small, it was really addictive. Its just as addictive now! The game mananges to have simple mechanics, yet is also extremely polished and fun. Keep it up, Halfbrick!', ""It's very interested!! When I played it for the first time, I found that - it gives me pleasure!! So, I can say it's nice and I dare myself to rate this game - even at least 4 Stars!!"", 'Really like this game although I have some thoughts about removing the old menu, anyway I bought the starter pack and it charged me but somehow I didnt get anything from it and I still have it showing on the menu like I havent bought it, I need help.', 'Too many intrusive ads with no option to skip. After 1-2 games you will loose interest in the game. Feels like you are watching ads most of the time instead of playing.', ""Great gameplay, still getting updates, and finally an app that does free to play right. Doesn't overwhelm you with ads, and some of the in-app purchases feel worthwhile. Great game overall"", 'This game is amazing my favorite part is all of the power ups that you can use to help you I think they should add a Sorta miner going underground power up I also love the daily updates.The controls are good cause their so simple and the gameplay has very good fell to it over all very good game.', ""A good game and is definitely different from other games alike, it's good when you have nothing to do however it can get quite repetitive over time, but I would definitely recommend for in your spare time."", ""Has become very glitchy with the most recent update. Says I haven't fulfilled the requirements to complete a mission when I actually have. The app also crashes occasionally."", 'Very fun and exciting with all the events , Though I would very much like to see a fluffy feline friend join in so I could use a kitty instead of flash, I like cats better. It could be called mittins, waffles or kittyüòä', 'I remember it you starting slowly and after hoping back to jetpack joyride after a few years you start with the speed of light barely reaching 1500 distance cant you make it the way it was before?', ""The game is cool but the commercials are too much for me it's like a commercial app and every few minutes you get to play a game I give it a 1 star"", 'After sometimes,the game automatically start my jetpack and I die every time This is now worst game I ever played I love the before jetpack joyride and now this game has a biggest bug.', 'Super fun game, everybody can enjoy it, little kids, elder people, hell even my dog loves this game! Everything in this game is so awesome. Just keep bringing new stuff!', ""I love the game an quality, but theres a bug. When I enter the game and play when I'm in little stomper it glitches. Please fix!"", 'It\'s a decent game but don\'t bother with the ""watch adds for free stuff"" most of the time it Doesn\'t work', ""Awesome game, definitely my favourite. I deinstalled and reinstalled it again a lot of times because it's so much fun! Good job!"", 'I love this game playing since a little kid and flash is sooo cute thanks.üéÆAlso I realy like BLING it on event and I have a new Idea for the game what if flash had his own little Jetpack! :-D', ""This is a great game. Jetpack Joyride should have a cult worshipping this!! Only 1 request... Can you please make the items just a bit cheaper? This game is perfect (kinda), and i thank you for making this game!! And anything else i like about this game? Everything. This game is awesome, and I've spent so much time trying to unlock everything, and inevitably... never get there. This game has so much content, and you just can't complete it! This game is awesome, and thanks for making this! :D"", ""Still the best game around REPLY: Wow, that's the first time a dev replies to me. For me in part it is definitely the nostalgia, because this game has been around for a while. I come back years later and it is still every bit as fun. It is bigger though and has no paywalls, so I love that too. Hope that answered your question Chloe, keep being awesome over there!"", ""This is one of the best games. I would give it five stars but there's a glitch. Every time I collect an event token or complete a mission in game it freezes for like 0.25 of a second. This is very annoying because I usually die right after. Can you please fix this glitch. If you do I will give five stars. Thank you. :)"", ""This game is now like it should be! I talked about a bug last time but now it's gone. I like this game alot now!"", ""I give this 4 stars for a few reasons. First, there are a lot of ads, but I understand that. Not many people purchase the packs, so they'vs gotta get the money elsewhere. Second, the game gets pretty laggy at the start of a run, but that has died down of recent. Third, even if you complete the tutorial for Magic Brick Wars, you still cannot recieve the special skin. That really isn't a huge deal. Other than that, the game is pretty fun. Very addicting!"", 'My favorite things about the game except the the addictive gameplay, are of course the so many gadgets i can use,the powers, the roullete at the end,the many rides,and of course the little details like flash having his own gadgets and his ears having through the wind while flying. Its little details like that that makes the game amazing:) and pls create more awesome gadgets, more the better:) Goodluck', ""This is one of those nostalgia games. 101 games, plants vs zombies, doodle jump, fruit ninja, I played all of them as a kid. And it's still great! The game has very good elements, I love everything about his game. The fact that you shoot bullets out your jetpack is cool! It's super cool"", 'PLASTERED in ads! If you want to play this game for more than 30 seconds, you\'re gonna have to PAY! Real money, and not just pennies either. Or else there is the ""ransom your attention"" option. Watch the same ad, over and over, for some other freemium game. It\'s odd and it really breaks the mood of what is supposed to be a quick action game. Game-smashing power ups if you\'ll only watch 30 seconds of some utterly different game¬° i remember this game from years ago and it was fun, but not now..', 'Well for starters, I personally think this is one of my favorite mobile games so far, the only reason i would ever give a game I like a below 5-star rating is because of some kind of glitch. For this particular game the glitch was black screening me after a couple of ads, which is really annoying because i have to exit the game and load it back up. However, I have only had this glitch twice now and I hope that this glitch will no longer bother me in future gameplay. Thank you.', ""It's so fun!! I left the game back in early 2015 cause it felt repeatitive and at the time the only good thing IMO was S A M, but I decided to pick it back up for no particular reason in late 2019 and man has the game improved so much, I was generally shocked by how amazing the game has become and all the new challenges that I encounter throughout each gameplay! Best game I have ever played and I am so happy I decided to pick it back up again! Q: Whats my fav thing about the game A: Power Ups!!"", 'Good game, gets a little repetitive after awhile but still a good game and not to many adds', ""I've played this game when I was younger and now that I've come back it's gotten laggyer in I can't even play a full match"", 'Even after all these years, jetpack joyride is, just that. A joyride. It hasn\'t gotten many updates, but I don\'t think it needs any. It\'s an amazing game as is, and best of all, ITS NOT PAY TO WIN! I mean, it sorta is, but it\'s not as in-your-face ""hey you need more cash, wanna buy some?"" As other games. Ya fun good halfbrick', ""One the better mobile games i had, notice I said had. Spent several days trying to unlock the most expensive items in the game. Was really enjoying, when i uninstalled it to get more space, thinking i would reinstall it sometime. When playing the game again, I was left with none of my progress, I'm almost positive I was signed into google play as I did with every game prior to this one. All of that time spent was wasted when I made the decision to uninstall it. Please fix this. Sincerley, Sggy"", ""This game is fun and I haven't had too many issues with ads but it would be cool if the game was on play pass so that I could still support the game without paying specifically to remove the ads. And also I am having issues with slowdown and lag on the OnePlus 3t. Which considering the tech when this game was originally released should be more than enough to run it smoothly so maybe work on optimisation"", 'The ""new things"" that was added just can\'t make up for the crazy amount of ads added in. I only tried it again because of nostalgia. But yeah, if anything this has became just one of those generic mobile games. Gameplay gets old real quick, get to this certain distance, die, watch ad, die again, watch ad and repeat. Clearing a task get the rewards and upgrades and then what? It ironically feels not so rewarding. The game\'s too repetitive to have this much ads. This is just greedy.', 'Game is completely based around ads. Everything can be achieved by watching more ads. It even forces you to watch ads even when you dont fall for their pathetic scheme and watch a video every time you lose, itll just force you to watch one anyway. Not only that but it hides the X fkr 5 seconds or more so you have no choice but to watch the ad or close the app. Well ive closed the app, permanently. What an absolute trash product. Make a game, not a program that tricks people into watching ads.', ""Edit: this last release is filled with bugs. I've tried twice to get my day-5 SAM, but on the fifth day it says it's day 1. I've paid for the app, but all of a sudden I'm getting pop-up ads again. Minorly, my challenge progress is sometimes not credited (i.e. the challenge is go 1,000m without the machine gun jetpack and I'm on 4,000m with the bubble jetpack and no check mark). I love this game and play it casually, but it's frustrating me with the recent bugs. Thank you!"", ""It is a great game to pass time, i've been playing it since 2015, and i always had a great experience with it. I decided to reinstall it and try it out, but it looks like all my progress and all my in-app purchases have gone to waste, i had a coin doubler, and i was looking forward to use it now, but it seems i have to buy it again, since i can't seem to find a restore in-app purchases button. I hate to be stingy, but i don't really want to pay up another 5.99‚Ç¨ for it again. Great game otherwise""]"

The interface of the mazes menu (relaxed, challenging, and elite) to select any mazes I want to play is totally awful!

Better make a grid view like the old one."", ""Every version update gets worse and more commercial. Now there are more commercials than ever and constant pressure to watch more apps.

I deleted the game per my sanity, at 52 yrs old I play 2 lessen stress, not 2 gain it."", 'This had to be one of the worst bubble shooter games I have ever played. The mechanics are clunky, the levels are boring and it\'s a pretty clear rip off of Panda Pop. It is pretty much impossible to reach 3 stars on most of the levels (you need stars to advance to different islands in game).
