I get that you can't use licensed music but come on, those singers are seriously bad. Plus on this app you spend 80% of your time watching ads and 20% actually playing. I'll be uninstalling."", 'An incredible game that helps you train your hand-eye coordination, which is very helpful, but there is just too many ads, and I also wish you could replay the songs after you passed the level without the ""endless"" mode which is several times faster.', ""Too many adverts ruin a cool game, 30 second adverts every time you lose a game and a 3.99 a week payment option, considering this is aimed at younger kids, it's a rip off for what it is if you pay for it, 175 quid a year, I can buy a Nintendo switch lite for that much money!!"", 'I have played this like everywhere because it does not have to have wifi for this game amd it is good for the kids that just love to listen to music and play games and this saves you a lot of money on having to pay for data but if you are lookinh for a good quality game then this is just not the game for you.', ""I love rythm games and I thought this one hit the spot BUT they have an event and without bragging, I'm 100% sure that the song isn't quite hard and I always based in timing of tune. It kept on giving cool and it kept on giving me mistakes so that I can watch countless advertisements to continue. What an ad feeding type of game. Great gameplay but ad on purpose makes people uninstall games especially if it goes FREQUENTLY like this one."", 'I wish I could rate this a million stars, because this is a WONDERFUL PIANO APP! 😉 At first, I was like: ""Ehh, it won\'t be that bad.."" Then when I tried it, it was AMAZING! 😊 Thank you for making this, I appreciate your apps very much.', ""So much wrong here. Paid to remove ads but you still have to watch ads to continue. Paid for unlimited continues but still have to watch ads to continue. I'm trying to protect my daughter, but this app uses explicit songs despite the E rating and shows political ads. Either change the app rating or remove ads and content that aren't appropriate for the everyone rating."", ""This is a great ,fun,addictive game!Just a bit too many ads... Please reduce the number of pop-up ads.Overall, this is an AMAZING game. I just don't understand why do the songs sound different than the original. Please explain."", ""This game is so much like you need to download it gives you an exercise on your hands and fingersand it's so much fun you can play so many different songs and my favorite song is faded by Alan Walker and you unlock more songs you have to get three crowns in three stars 3 stars go slower and then faster and then the broncos super super super super super super super super super fast you need to download magic tiles 3 is so much fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄"", ""Literally forcing people who watch ads to download the game. It kept popping up on my background apps once I mistakenly clicked the try now button. I would have downloaded it if this wasn't the case. Very shameful. Hope this review helps :)"", 'I love this game because there is loads of songs and you can play endless songs that never end. but my favourite song is Crazy Frog I love Crazy Frog because the song is so fast! I Think that you should download this game it is really FUN 😀', 'So many ads. Also when i press the buttom the song does not start because the song is running it self.So what is the point from pressing buttoms while it is useless to press. It will be better to listen to a song instead to waste our time in this stupid game. If i could i will make no star.', 'This game is very fun!But you have to wait a long time to get songs that you want of you have to watch videos for it.But it helps you exrisise your fingers and hands so yeah😁 . . . . . . .', 'I love this game it\'s good when you want to challenge yourself and its goof when you just want a distraction, some ""me time"". I wish I knew how to challenge my friends. The ones who DON\'T have Facebook.', ""I think this game is pretty cool but I think you should be able to search your favorite song, so I would have rated 5 stars if you could search your favorite song but other than that it's a good game"", ""This is a great game. It makes me feel to play it hole day. But it doesn't pick up when you press a tile some time . But it have a botton that says continue. Have a great day bueeeeeeee."", 'Not laggy at all, play with your friends and compete with other players!!!! The game gives you so much without any effort. Best stress reliefing app but i would recomend the songs a bit faster 😁😁😁', 'I think this game is really fun except when you battle people all the battles are chat room. But it is a very nice relaxing game for kids and adults.', ""It is that good that I can't say it by word. But the only thing I am requesting is that please make a search option to search songs because I am searching shape of you song for weeks and couldn't find it"", 'Great music,classics & modern . Fun challenges to be played solo or with friends. Thanks for the free game.', ""I like this app because you have so many songs to choose from but the only thing that I don't like about it is that when you want to move on you can not always get the add to move on that's why I only have this game a 4 star but it is still an amazing game"", 'Good idea. WAY TOO MUCH ADS!! None of the songs are originals or full they are sort crappy edition of real thing. Like bad karaoke. Therefore 2 stars. I recommend to skip this one.', ""I ❤️ it so much! You can choose your music and start tapping on the tiles! And it's kind of hard but WHO cares? LITERALLY get this game (if ya want) but you should JUST for a try out! It's so good!"", ""I've only played for an hour and I'm already addicted. I didn't know there was a magic tiles 4 and I don't think I need anything more. I don't have any complaints honestly."", 'Paid $2.99 for ""remove all in-game ads"" and still have ads on certain songs to play and to continue a failed song... i demand a refund because i still have ads and i see no change after purchase. thanks', 'Hilariously bad MIDI/cover versions of pop songs and excessive, loooong ads. I had to laugh when the song it generated using one of my own songs included just holding down a single key for about twenty seconds and nothing else.', ""I loved this game. But now that im at level 18 and gotten so far into the list of songs they are songs that i don't know and are extremely boring."", ""I really like this tiles version. I've been doing tiles since the first one and I loved it since the first one. I realize that they've been taking a lot of people suggestions and pudding. Big-time stars and songs into their tiles and it's really nice to have a beads to the tile that makes it so much easier to get past the levels now. I just love"", 'This game is too rushed and developers are very lazy,the ads are everywhere even when you dont have internet,but it loads then you have to reload the game. Its a wastes of a space and time for your mobile device.', ""While the idea is interesting, this game fails massively on keeping a new user interested because it pushes TONS of ads down your throat from the very beginning and at every step. If you fail one tile, which is bound to happen when you're a beginner, you are served 20 seconds of ad... EACH time! Of course, you can't skip those ads because are of the nasty kind that have a timer and can't be cancelled. Honestly, a few ads and I might have considered buying the game, but this? No way."", ""The game never picks up when you hit a tile, the music audio is bad, and it doesn't give you any variety of songs. I don't recommend this game, but you play whatever floats your boat."", ""I gave this game a 1 star because on the the advertiser is says pick out of 3 songs for one you don't do that and whenever you click on one it doesn't count so if your looking for a piano tiles game I would recommend piano tiles 2"", ""The game in itself is okay, other than the notes don't match with the song. I mean, it's like you're playing a game with music to listen to, not playing the music. The developers are lazy, after you get the 3 stars you move on to the crowns and all they do is speed up the music. Finally, there are too many adverts. After watching 3 advertisements to regain your lifes on the song, they play another 30 second advert. This app will waste your time. I suggest you DO NOT play it. :(("", ""It take's alot of time to loud and get in also it take's to much time to get in and play the song i'm going to give.you a 4 and a half star's pleas fix it."", 'This game is so good!!!! It increases your concentration and focus with exotic music. It also increases the speed of your fingers.', 'I love this app because it is a nice variety af easy medium and hard levels,lots of songs to choose from, very fun and relaxing, nothing wrong, play this app now!!!', ""I love this game! I always play this at my house and my dad's work! It is a awesome game! It does not have to many adds, and my favorite part of the game is I get to listen to song's wall I play!!!! Everyone should play this game!!! It is a free game, and it takes 1 minute to download!!!! All the people in the world should play this game!!!"", ""I think it's a good app as compared to many others because in this app the most important thing is that it need full attention or concentration .. so you have the complain that I can't focus during study so just play this game before study for 4 to 5 minutes..... Then you will see your focus.... And the most important thing that during playing this game , you will enjoy the music also.."", 'l liked this game alot especially when there are so interesting and nice songs..the only part i didnt like was when there is a very long add after every turn..I would suggest to remove that problem or if we ever try to switch off the internet because of the adds ..the game also doesnt play without internet connection!!!!《《~~', 'The most heart touching game yeah i m saying it play with purpose seems like you are playing the song when you do it perfectly .True, waht a geniius mind before this game...']"

❤️ Enjoy the game and rate for us 👍","[""It wasn't that bad, in quick pacing songs there was spaces that were to far apart and to close to the other one to get and the game was rather sensitive to the touch so :/ you also have to watch a bunch of ads to get the songs and theres ads between like every song so, I wouldn't recommend it if you need a relaxing game with music."", 'It was horrible and in the ad it says you get to choose this song but actually it was a list of songs and you have to watch an ad if you want to get any of them and speaking of add any time you die in the game which is really hard and you have to watch another ad the ads are crazy and the game its relly hard. Recommend you do not download it.', ""The game is great, the only reason I'm giving four stars is because whenever I try to play my main song, or any song other than Faded, for that matter. It won't work, it tells me that the data could not be downloaded. I don't want to reinstall because I have no Facebook, so I cant save what I've done, and I've purchased no ads and have over four million gems. I do not want to uninstall because of this glitch. Please fix this."", 'I really really loved this game. Whoever created this, step away from your phone or device, look into a mirror and congratulate yourself. Even a pat on the back. Whoever made this game, you are awesome. Forget those people who gave your game 2 stars', ""I love all the songs and how you can watch an ad to play your own song, but I used to be able to use my phone's S pen on the game but now I can't . It will work on the home page and stuff, but once I enter the game, it won't move the ball. If my pen worked on this, my review would be 5 stars!! Edit: After the update, the pen works again! It was a lot more fun playing with my S pen! Thx developers!"", ""I think that tiles hop is really fun.I enjoy it because it gets harder and harder,And because I get to just watch a video to resume the game without having to start all over again.The reason I only put 3 stars is because ii thought you could type your favourite song in and when you are playing it will play that song.nut there was no music at all.i think that the people that made this game shouldn't lie on the video.P.S. I did press ok to sounds on settings .😊😊🤔🤔"", ""I rated this a 2 because, it's a good game and all. But in the adds it says that you can type your favorite song and it will play it, how do you do that? Second, there is alot of adds. Ya know when your trying to play your song but there is an add it's kinda triggering. Thanks for reading. Bye!"", ""Super average. The game is full of invasive ads that ruin any source of entertainment that could be salvaged from such boring/average gameplay. You get to listen to some songs you like but if you want to do that just get Spotify or something. A big problem is the game is to easy, since it's so easy people who want a challenge will be left feeling bored and unsatisfied. I beat the fastest levels on my first try within 10 minutes of downloading the game. Don't install if you want a challenge."", 'Blown my mind What to say. You can actually import your own songs on the game and then you can play. And also it adapts the some speed and tone based on your Sony you import. Awesome feature. There is ad too much, but for giving only 10 rs or 0.2 or 0.5 dollars something it is completely ad free.', ""Amazing game. I found out from experience and skills that in Unity, when you reach about 450 points, the pitch will start to increase Edit: Feb. 1, 2020. Welp... This game was somewhat ruined. In endless mode, the pitch increases for every song. Its fine for some songs(Alan walker - fade), but some don't sound good (TheFatRat - Unity sounds like a reprogrammed smoke alarm)."", 'This game is so relaxing and enjoyable. I love going to a quiet place, putting my headphones on, and playing. There is nothing i would like you to change or update. Only there is a bit to much ads and at least have an ad every other song there is an ad. But bwsides that i love it. 5/5 ratings', ""The ads were obnoxious and my phone kept freezing up mid-play. I don't like the fact that ads could automatically open up my play store; that was highly irritating. I would've liked it better if the tiles actually played along to the beat. (Just a preference). My overall experience wasn't pleasant, but others may disagree."", ""refreshing, pass some time while enjoying the songs.. but if you don't pay for removing ads that mean: you win..ad, you lose..ad , losse but wanna continue where you at...ad, but if you lose and accept to start over the song..oh ok then? nooo! ad! ads! ads! adsssss... i had to pay to protect my sanity! fine you wanna get paid for your efforts but dammit make the ads every 5 minutes or only after 2 or 3 play not every second!!!"", ""I gave this 4 stars as it is really relaxing to listen to all the songs and there is a lot of selection to choose from. I didn't give this 5 stars because when I first saw the advert for this, I was playing a game and it pinged up in my phone. I was interested as it said you could search your favourite song but in the actual game it didn't. Also, I didn't give it 5 stars as the game wasn't really for me but I would recommend it to anyone who thinks they are bad at piano tiles(like me!)."", 'LOVE IT. Relaxing, eye hand co-ordination, good memory focus. My kids and I play it at the same time on our tablets/laptops to see who gets the highest score. Very competitive especially if you have kids and MUMMY (me) ...... WINS lol. Competitive ""IN A COOL WAY"" ..... Good music too and you can play your own music :)', ""It is good but for some reason it won't let me download my own songs. since I've finished most of them, I thought I should practice with other songs I know but it doesn't work...If you fix this I'll give it 5 stars! But anyway good game :D"", ""I love concept but there are surely other games like this that are better. Some 'ads' aren't even ads and so I have to exit the ad and I can't continue from where I left off. I don't have a touchscreen so it made it even harder, I didn't even make it past the first level. I deleted it mainly because it was frusterating."", 'Way too many ads and the songs they do give you are very short. Some songs even buffer while playing, which makes you mess up and have to watch another ad to continue playing.', ""Too many ads, lags WAY too much, you need to watch ads for most of the song. Mind you, I have perfect connection, and this game STILL lags a LOT. This game is so bad, I'd rather put a toothpick underneath my toenail and kick my wall as hard as I can. THAT'S HOW BAD THIS GAME IS"", 'I like how you advertised songs that you didnt even have like Good as Hell by Lizzo or Roxanne. Not. And you even advertised a fake feature of looking up a song that you liked. Im aware that there is a insert your own music option. But really. The gameplay is pretty good though.', ""I paid MYR1.99 to remove the ads. But then when the ball fell, I have to watch a reward video in order to restart from where I left. It says that the video is not available, after I paid to remove the ads eventhough I'm online at that time. I suggest that you should remove the ads COMPLETELY if that person PAID TO REMOVE THE ADS. And now after the recent updates it said that I can't load the sing that I uploaded."", 'When I started the game with faded and I finished it, I tried to go to a different one. It said something like ""failed to load data"" well it was something like that. Then I decided to watch a ad to get another song, same thing happened. Please do something about this or check into it.', 'This game is not worth it. You can\'t choose the song and only one song is available. It says you can watch an ad to get a new song, but you watch the ad and then it says, ""Failed to download data."" There are also way too many ads. I deleted it the day I got it.', ""so if you're bored you can just play it and if you love music it depends on your speed to if you're really fast the music's going to come out also it's a great thing to play when your lonely because there's nothing to do you could just be like if you love music okay I'm down for this musicthat makes you get really intense to beat your high score do you like I'm ready you got all the energy in you"", ""It's very fun but when ever I try to put one of my songs there it say successful then it'll say failed to download data and it's very annoying and I can only play my alarms because of it. Overall it very fun but they need to get it to let me play actual songs."", ""I really think this game is awesome for what you get. The free version has a LOT of ads - by ut to go ad free only costs 69p - it's totally worth it. The songs are awesome and you can upload your own music. Highly recommended!"", ""This Is the best game I have ever played 1:It has my favorite song on it.2:I got Faded at 606 Score.3:Its a ball hopping onto tiles and right when that happens it bounces back off the tile.4:I am good at it. That's why I love the game so much I would recommend this game to other people"", 'The songs without voices are really good they have good tempos, Good beats, and that kind of thing.Now,IF you decide to get this game then be warned.. THE VOICES ARE 100% FAKE!!! Just listen to the songs with voices and you can hear it.', ""It's fun, but gets boring quick. The audio also glitches quite a bit. Not very satisfactory."", ""I love this game but theres only one problem everytime I get to a high score and I'm still playing it kills me for no reason and I can be on the tile and everytime I watch a video to try again and 5 seconds later it kills me."", 'I absolutely L-O-V-E it but the only problem is that there is lots of ads . It happens every time you have finished and it is really annoying plz fix it but overall smashed it make more games like this amazing game tysm!! :)', ""I'm personally like to play music games so I think I found my love:-) I personally recommend this game for music lovers such as me."", ""This is a fantastic game, it even let's you use your own songs, but, theres way too many ads, way too many, and some adds I have to go back to the home screen and then come back just to play."", ""there's to much ad abuse and this game plays them every time you say no thanks after dieing even if you just taped the revive button and it says no ads running. WHY DO THIS TO PLAYERS? ITS AD ABUSE!!!! I'm triggered. Not to mention omost all the song cut."", ""The best game when I have stressed I play and then I have no more stress the song the balls tipe and I got to level 3 with the same song just today that game is AMAZING I really loved it so much so fun for adult a kids too I will always play this game because it's my favorite game of all this game is better than til tok WOW"", ""It's a good game I really love the songs but I only have one problem in the adds it's showing them typing the song but when I play it is have to choose from a play list will someone explain why.other than that great game 5 stars"", ""I love it bc it can tell you your favorite song and stuff and when you sad you play it like for example if your husband left the country your girlfriend left the country that's why because somethings my mom leave the house and my brother and sister going to mess with me then I said just tell mama on them then I tell on them than like 1 hour later I play this I love it must wanna play it sense I told u plz give this 5 Stars love Robert Moss that is angry and annoying don't like to stop talking.K"", 'SO. MANY. ADDS!!! but really fun to play the description said that you could type on ur fave song! How? Still reccomend tho! But developers, please fix this issue!', ""Forced ads, unresponsive controls, and the ads that I do decide to watch don't give me rewards. This is probably the second time I have ever rated any app at 1 star."", 'Great game and great support team for their quick response to fix the bugs reported.']"

More realistic use.","[""The game was ok but I soon realized that the title of the game is 'Real Piano - Play and Learn'. There was non learning aspect on the app. There was a feature where you could listen to baby nursery rhymes but there was no physical way to learn them!! I rated 3 because it was the only decent app I could find. If not, I would have rated 1 star!!"", ""Don't ask me why I gave three starts just be okay with that! Now I love playing the piano it just that it hard to do it fast or slow to play the song I love so yeah you get 3 starts for that because it was okay."", 'I love pianos and guitars... Me and my bff are making a song and we need some vocals to work on our song. I got one guitar app and i need a piano and i got the perfect app. The reason why i gave four stars is because it needs a button to lower the pitch or just raise the speed or lower the pitch but it is better than nothing... Keep up the goods bilkon!!!', ""This is an interesting game. It works but it's very slow, when you press a note it makes a sound a second after. The other instruments don't sound like it much and tittle is Real Piano - play and learn, you don't learn anything in this game. I recommend that you shouldn't get this game."", 'I love this app and love real instrument piano for play, its music blowing me like wind and become me musician, superb app for play broad keyboard for play nice to me. I was finding like it app.', ""Best game ever of lifetime! And if I were you, I will install this game. Because you could make music, and listen to music. Hopefully they more apps like this. Real Piano is fun, when you install this, it could teach your kids to learn music. There's, Jingle bells, Happy birthday, Merry Christmas, and some other songs. Like this comment if you agree 💯. ___donutyummy9, AKA Maria Vargas Barjas."", ""It's a pretty good replacement for if you don't have a real piano There could be some better changes but is serves its function"", ""the piano sounds quite good. but i'd love to see more, for example, split screen for left and right hands. that'll be very convenient"", 'The delay in touch to audio is way too significant. Its almost impossible to play anything without extreme planning.', ""This was a very good installation as it helped me practice on the go but there wasn't enough finger space and so I rate this app one less star than full stars."", ""very very unresponsive, like it's really bad to the point of annoying, basically unplayable.."", ""It's a nice piano but the fraction of a second delay really throws you off tempo. Anyone who plays with delay effects knows that they can be a bit confusing. But honestly it's a great piano app."", ""It's a good way to play a piano if you don't have one. You can play loads and loads of songs on there aswell."", ""I like this game, but I do wish that the recording list doesn't make the songs short but it's a good game"", 'It was easy to play and u can learn how to plat the piano quickly.

Please fix this; thank you!', 'Great app fab for learning how to play a couple of ads but outher than that ist gerat !!!! 😊😊😊😊', ""Its really fun I just wish you could press more than two keys and that the organ option wasn't do loud"", 'Very nice aap...I love it... it helps me to learn how to play piano.', 'Amazing sound, more realistic sound of piano then other piano apps.

Love your game😊😉"", ""I like this game so much and the beat is so perfect, alot of the songs remind me of good memories I had, and I just love this game, it's much better then the original pianos, this just adds much more stuff much more graphics and textures, it's an amazing game and I reckon everyone should try it👍👍 Oh did I forget to say that it's a very VERY COOL GAME😎\U0001f91f"", ""Nice catchy beats would be nice if you add a way to play music from our files and jam out to our own music it's great as is but imagine that whats a better genre or playlist to listen to while playing a game like this then our very own favorite music. I'm telling you this would have a huge impact and not even just that would most definitely attract multitudes of curious ears hearing about this bad ass like totally bitchen game that has the feature where you upload your own music ...boom. -M.O."", ""It's a really really good game EXCEPT for one issue, I play these type of games with bluetooth earbuds and this game doesnt have a music latency adjuster, so there is a lot of latency to my earbuds making this basically unplayable unless I use the phone's speakers. Please add this feature!!"", ""This is the first rythm game i found on the app store thats actually hard. It also doesnt spam you with ads or try to scam money out of you. They're intent was to make a game not make money. 5 stars"", ""Seems as though watching ads after losing lives while on a track causes a big sync issue. Happened in two songs so far making it unplayable. Marshmello - Alone and especially Unity - FatRat. Not sure if it's the songs themselves, or in general so far but as it's a rhythm game sync is integral so it'd be great to see this fixed."", ""Have only been playing for a short while, but the game is quite fun and runs without any issues. It's also relatively ad free, except for a small banner ad at the bottom of the screen. Would definitely recommend if you're looking for a fun rhythm game with some good tunes :)"", ""The gun sounds are too loud. Although the fine adjustment of the controls, it's overall difficult to control. The reticle is really hard to see against the background. Other than that, a really fun game with good music."", ""It makes you feel good at something In life! I prefer this over other beat games since it's much easier and fun. One thing I dont like is how the customization is randomized. Fairly good game, worth your time!"", ""This game is awesome! I love musics, no matter how fast it can be. I don't understand why people complain about the speed of the music. It gives you guys a challenge to beat the speed and never get bored with the same speed, keep playing this game, you can beat the speed soon. 😉😉💞💕💞Please add more music!!!

This is the best game I have EVER played I usally don't write reviews on games..but this is just an AMAZING GAME! Don't listen to ANY of the bad reviews!

Best game I have ever played y'all did an REALLY good job on this!🖤👏 Trust me it's so worth the download! Edit: But could you PLEASE make a way were you can add your own music? Besides that AMAZING GAME!"", ""Better than I'd expected, reminds me of osu in that when you hit a quick string of notes it sounds like another instrument has been introduced to the song I love it."", ""I love this game! It's a little challenging but not too hard, very satisfying. The only issue is this-- if you have a screen protector that's one of those rubbery shock resistant ones, it gets kind of impossible at times. The game is controlled through swiping your finger along the screen, and these kinds of screen protectors make that extremely difficult to do QUICKLY unless your hands are absolutely bone-dry. So, although I adore the game, it's not really feasible for me. Maybe a stylus? :/"", 'It is very fun i enjoy it really well, for the first time in forever i enjoyed myself by only playing online games!!!u should try it!', 'I do like this game. Although basically a ripoff of Piano Tiles, Beat Fire has a decent main mechanic, and nice selection of songs. There are lots of ads, as is to be expected with basically any free-to-play game, but watching ads is mostly voluntary, and the rewards for doing so are reasonable. The aesthetics of the game are good, although the general timing is mediocre at best for a rhythm game. Some maps are difficult to play by reflex only, as dodgy timing throws you off. Would recommend.', 'When I saw this game on the play store I thought ""This is gonna be really hard."" But when I played it it wasn\'t that hard. The controls are realy simple. The only thing I would like added though is a mode with no gun shot sounds if some people don\'t like the gun shot sounds when they play. But other than that it\'s a really good game. Definitely get it.', ""The first time I play the game... I thought it will be a stupid game but now I loved it and I can do alone remix even if I'm seven and keep up the good work"", ""I love this game, it reminds me of similar games like magic tiles, piano tiles, ect. But I especially like this game the most because there's levels of the same song, you can accessorize the gun and tiles and there's even a stage room where they start from a very easy song and go up as of now I'm on 9 of the stage room. this game in my opinion needs some updates. Like I would really like it if we had more modern music like rap, hiphop and some oldies to. Also of we could create our own levels :)"", ""I've sunk hours upon hours in this game and having beaten each and every song with medium, hard and endless difficulty I could say I'm ready to make a review. Overall, the game is just great if you're looking for an easy alternative to Piano Tiles or pretty much any other rhythm-based game. Beat Fire's volume level is pretty high by default, so you also might want to look out for that.""]"

Removes pop-ups and lives, but for $12, the entire game should be unlocked - not still forcing ads every song. Terrible. Please avoid unless you want to spend more time watching ads, EVEN AS AS A PAYING CUSTOMER, than playing the knock-off cover songs of popular songs.', 'The game runs slow and is laggy causing needless deaths. Between each death is an ad that you can skip but it\'s often unresponsive when you try to do so. A Google ad banner at the bottom of the start screen made it hard to press the start button without triggering that banner. There are a ton of clones of this kind of game, often with better execution. If I wanted to watch ads all day I\'d install one of those ""pay to watch"" scam apps.', ""SO SLOW when u play it is so SLOW at catching up my screen is moving forward and the coloured ball is back down SO I can not see on the add it looked very fun and addictive but I guess I was completely WRONG 😡. I totally agree with all the 1 star reviews I would all day lone give a big fat 0 OUT OF 10 I'm not sure about the ads I never had any ads. \U0001f92c😠😱"", ""In the game play just like it kind of Frieza sometimes it would have you try to get a new road after you went to ball and I turned off the music that you're hearing for a while and then we get it goes back on so yeah and then the other one is like it's nice and all but but it kind of the graphics kind of like make it like to work for Mac kind of an interesting and finally the controls it's fun to play the game but..... love you going for another ball sometimes it just freezes but the really good"", 'I feel that it\'s a fun game but it needs more songs, also by the original artist. Some of the songs I don\'t like because of how it\'s a cover by another artist or either the song was remastered, making the original artist\'s pitch off key, which I really didn\'t like while playing. Other than that great game so far. For instance, ""Let it Go"" and ""Cheap Thrills"" was one of my least favorites because of how it was remastered.', 'The game grafics are awesome and so I the music, fantastic. Just one thing that bugs me is the ads. When I want to unlock a new song it says watch a video to get and then it says ""reward video unavailable"" and they really makes me want to delete this game. Basically, it all come down to ads. Ads, ads ADS! It\'s SO ANNOYING', 'It keeps on putting the same ad every time it also sometimes glitches Its a good game but it gets annoying to see the same ad over and over again and the music does not sound like the singer at all', ""DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME! Amanotes respond very late, they don't respond through email. You have to personally message them on Facebook. I already paid but still see pop up ads. Update:finally after long process I got refunded. Uninstalling game right away(5 stars solely for more people could view my review)"", ""It was constantly stopping and at a point to where it got stuck again and again in the first 5 minutes of playing. Also it is not challenging at all and thought it would be good to get out of boredom. I'd rather play anything else than this slow game."", ""I like it but it's ganna be a 3. I like how it has levels and stuff but it needs more acion, I'll play it alot though! This is a good game for the most"", 'In the ad,it said you can type your""favourite song"".BUT IT DOSENT EVEN LET YOU!!I looked all over the app,I found no""type in your song""feature!Do not download this app!The ad LIED to you!', ""In the ad you can type what song you want and it magically pops up. That's pure advertising. And speaking of ads the entire game is full of them. There are after the levels, ads for free life, even the songs are full of ads. You HAVE to watch ads to unlock ANY song. They might as well call it the dancing road of ads. I understand that ads are need to make money for the game but no one needs that much money. The game idea isn't even original, there are like a million better games just it. Big 0"", 'I usually never give one star, but the music was muffled and low quality, the game was slow and stopped multiple times. There were way too many adds, it took me THIRTEEN MINUTES just to scroll from song number seventy to number one. It did not let you choose your own music, and the controls were stiff and horrible. And, to my best knowledge, the only options you could choose from for music all came from 94.9, which means different genres were not explored.', 'I want a game where you type in a song or an artist but this you choose songs and watch 50 billion adds !!!!! Rage level - 10000000! -100 (negative 100) stars', ""I can't even figure out what coins are used for, ads required to unlock music are frequently unavailable, and I have yet to have played more than a few moments. There are no guidelines to help with anything whatsoever. ***I spent a while figuring out the settings options and finally got a taste of some gameplay, after changing the road design. It is still very hard, and the ads required to continue or unlock stuff aren't always available to watch for a reward."", 'I really like this game because of the music I do not give many games full stars but I am going to say the only other I gave 5 stars is anti stress which is a real good game. However you will all think I am a bot advertising other games so imma leave yall alone peace sisters', 'Don\'t install this game if you think you\'re getting what you saw in the ads. You can\'t choose ""your favorite"" song. In fact, there aren\'t any actual songs in it at all, just music. No lyrics. Uninstalling without even getting past the tutorial. Blatant false advertisement. Don\'t advertise what you can\'t deliver. And WAY too many ads just in the very beginning of the game.', ""This particular game is more fun than similar ones out there. It's challenging and fast moving. There is an attractive aesthetic overall. New update there is an add bar at the bottom of the screen when you thought the adds couldn't get worse. Also half the music is christmas music, which is for some reason featured year round. I don't like any of the music tbh, but it was fun."", ""The colors and designs are so pretty but there are just so. Many. Ads. Just to play one track that's basically 30 seconds of play time you end often up watching anywhere from 30 seconds to several MINUTES worth of ads depending on the tracks difficulty. AND THEN on top of that, now there's Google ads permanently glued to the bottom and absolutely ruining the immersion. God forbid you click too low when trying to move the ball and WOOSH it's off to the play store. Super hard to get into."", 'Ok...started loving it...first 2 songs easy...then I got to that annoying frozen one...and the last in and out balls almost made me ""let it go"", the app, I mean. But kept playing until I decided to just try to pass that bit without hitting anything...and finally got the song done...but...to my surprise...didn\'t unlock the next song!!! And there are no ads to be played to try to unlock things!!! USELESS!! Uninstalled.', ""My question is when I was watching the ads I seen that you can type in a song that you like but the game ain't lettin me do it but everything else was good"", ""First, it was fun but there were SO many ads like everytime you finish a go theres an AD. Then, in the ad I watched you typed in a song and you play but in the real game you pick a specific song, not one you type. Next, it was super lagy. I don't recommend this to ANYONE not even a DEAD PERSON. Sorry for the hate I'm just being honest.."", 'It\'s good, at first. But after 5 minutes of playing after I have installed the app, I wan\'t to unlock ""Bad Guy"" track through wtching an \'Ad\' and nothing happened. And the error continued until I switched my track into ""Faded"" and it\'s repeating and keeping on downloading! I cannot take this anymore! And I have already uninstalled the app.', ""this app is okay it's reasonable but not one of my favorites I accidentally pressed on a button I didn't mean to press and it is loading currently and I cannot get it to stop loading whatever I do I press a ton of buttons I've tried deleting it and then reinstalling it but the loading thing will not leave so I'm a little bit upset at that but yeah it's all okay the gameplay is reasonable and the controls are not the most accurate but otherwise this game is pretty good but not the best I've seen."", ""What an amazing game! I just can't get enough of playing it no matter how many times I repeat playing the same levels, especially if the music or the song of the level is beautiful. I really like the colors and there are some epic music too. I also like the controling; it is really easy to control the movement of the ball no matter how fast it is. Thank you for your hard working. And, please, add more levels and songs."", 'I thought you could choose the song you moved the ball around to. I was disapointed to learn that this game has false advertising. This is not the first time I have expirenced this type of thing. For example, color by number apps say you can have glitter colors, but can you? No. I am starting to see this going around, and i just dislike it so much. So, if you ever make a game, use real advertsing a person can trust. I wish i could rate this app a zero stars. But i can not. I wasted my time.', ""I love the game a lot, it has a lot of great songs to play and a lot of different other things too. It does get glitchy at some points, if their isn't any wifi or anything like that. But it is still a good game and i would like their to be more cool songs too.💖😻"", ""Lovely game kinda fauls advertised you cant actually choose the song that u want to play but all negatives aside it's a lovely fun amazing game"", ""Everything is fine. Its just, I hate the fact that all songs aren't the original songs, they're all covers (bad covers also) so it doesn't make me enjoys the whole gameplay. Example, we don't talk anymore. I'm hoping foe it to be enjoyable until it isn't Charlie puth that's singing. I just wish the levels are longer than what they're now."", 'I love this game because she is easy for everybody and you will enjoy the game.', ""It was fun but wayyyyy too many ADS! One when you finish a song, and another before you can start the next one? 30 seconds each?! That's a minute of ads just to get to the next song, are you kidding me? Not to mention all the ads to do literally anything in the game. The concept is cool and plays smoothly, but the music selection is lame for anyone that's not in middle school. Uninstalling after an hour of play (and 45 minutes of ads!)"", ""Everywhere is ads and in game music must be downloaded while playing a game.. So u need to turn on Wi-Fi.. = another ads.. After you die in any level you can leave to main menu (u have to watch ad) or you can continue where u died (another ad) What the hell.. So many levels can't be played without ads.. Omg this game s*cks Gonna remove it.. (gameplay is good and i like the game but these ads..) Im so sorry developers but really? U should remove these ads"", 'Good songs... way to many ads. So many to the point where if it asks you if want to watch an ad for free items that when you press no you are forced to watch an ad anyway for 30 seconds. Unbearable. Ruins a decent game.', 'Could be better but most of all very good app.when i play for two hours without even noticing and me think that i was playing for only 15 minutes', ""THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER!!!!! I would give it one million stars if I could! I'm telling you to download this game if you don't already have it! Yes there are adds but they have to make money some how so don't be grumpy at all the adds ! I'm 100% sure you will love this game PLEASE DOWNLOAD!!!

When i reached the song ""Bad Guy - Billie Eilish"" I went to go press on ""Play new song"" and i pressed it, than it said that the song wasn\'t avalible. So now i can only play 4 songs ""UNITY THEFATRAT"" - ""FADED"" - ""LET IT GO"" - ""AND BAD GUY."" I hope this game gets a chance to fix the problem, because i really love this game. And i don\'t want to uninstall it on my phone!', ""I love this game. It's really fun a d it always give you a head start on which color is next so you go to the correct one. The only problem I had was the new songs loading. They take forever to load."", ""Awsome game, after playing for a while, i was attached to this game like i couldn't let go of my phone playing and seeing the awsome background and song is so clear i would use them in my videos. Thanks so much for making this game, i was watching youtube then i saw this ad. i descided to test it out for a while and i was Boom in my mind. How awsome! ❤️"", 'NO tHe AdZ why did game make me regret getting any music games also WHERE IS TRUTH HURTS? I can\'t find it. Never get dis app THE ADS! It ask u ""oh want to watch and add for this?"" I\'m like no AND THEN AN ADD POPS UP ENY WAY! What is that about! I know that ads=money but in dis case ITS AN OVER LOAD OF JUST ADS and it made me watch THREE ads to unlock ONE song!!!😡 And its LOUD I turn my valium down to a bit and I still hear it!']"

This doesn't make timing any more difficult, the game is incredibly simple on hard, and the pre install songs suck tbh."", ""i am not that good at rhythm games, and chances are, you're not as good as this game makes you think either. I knew immediately when I went to Normal and notes were flying that the game was holding my hand the whole way. If you hit a note vaguely around the time it appears toward the bottom of the screen, chances are you're going to get a 'perfect'. This is, of course, to offer that success dopamine to keep you around and playing for that sweet, sweet ad revenue. Well it isn't working on me."", ""Too many ads makes the game hang and crash a lot. If you're thinking of installing this because of the Local Songs feature, don't. It does not work. (Even if it does the notes are random). Default songs are very generic.

Please fix this!', 'Sadly does not work as expected - broken slooooooooow sound makes it pain for the ears.', 'Should add an option where the menu song can be changed to old one.

Lastly, I think the 24hr wait for only 100 coins is too long, if it's going to make us wait 24hrs for coins it should at least be 200 coins or shortening the time to wait for coins."", ""This game is soooooooo cool and fun and one of the best games ever and I mean it isn't bad but the reason why I give four stars is because sometimes it doesn't load and kicks me out the game but this game is really cool but this game is the best and I like when they update it and how they add super star and mega star and I really really love the updates I would like to give it five but it's just one problem I have but for crying out loud this is the best game it might be even better than roblox"", ""I set it up and pressed dance, I charged my profile for coins but couldn't proporly connect to the second screen so canceled it and didnt back the coins, I tried again and the same thing happened.

That reason happens to be the coin system. Yes, I know VIP is there to make money, understandable and trust me I don't have a problem with it, but I don't feel like paying for VIP and I think it takes too long to get coins. I just got the game and already blew my 200 coins. I feel that the wait time for coins should be shorter, and/or you should earn coins by playing. Besides that, I'd totally recommend it."", ""It was amazing to see just dance on a phone!!! Works really well too!! I was disapointed when I saw that you have to pay to play more than 2 times a day. I really despise that sort of game. Would play again if I could have unlimited trys per day but until then I will play something else... It's sad to see this. The game has so much potential but flopped because of the price."", ""This app is a really, really good idea to make, but the problem is, the coin system is very annoying, another star taken because for some reason, all of a sudden the game is rigged, I'm missing gold moves even though I did it properly, I dont really wanna complain about that because other than that I'm doing really good as a dancer too, Thanks for adding superstar and megastar to the game, I was really surprised when I played just dance for the first time in a few months and got superstar."", 'This would be an amazing experience if you could play the song you ""purchase"" all day instead of having to ""pay"" everytime. Also When I try and play a song it glitches out and the music and dancing freezes, the lyrics still go and it still registers my phone\'s movements, everything else just stops. When I try to restart the game and replay that song I lose out on a free turn. But then it doesnt work again and I\'ve just wasted my final free song. So maybe it\'s a bug, idk, but not happy.', ""It's really fun but the unenjoyable part of the game is the money. I just find it like a throw off part of the game because you have to wait 24 hours for 100 coins and the songs cost a lot which it's a really fast game experience, it's a bit unfair that we only have 200 coins every 24 hours and I'm not willing to wait every day to get 200 coins. The VIP doesn't last very long but it's okay."", ""I like this since the first time I played it on PS4. As for this I'd like it to be easier to join the room and since I cast it to my TV I would like graphics to be just a little improved As for controls it is annoying to keep the phone in hand while dancing, if it is doable maybe you can do something to detect the moves via camera just like on PS4? In that case the game would be perfect. Anyway, I gave you five stars for the incentive"", ""The app is good and everything. The reason I give this a three star because its takes too long to get coins and its good you're trying to keep the VIP cheap, but not everyone has enough money. The first time I joined, I only got 200 and it wasn't enough. Can you at least put one hour to earn coins? That would be awesome. Other than that, the game is pretty good."", ""The app is pretty good the only thing that we need is more points because they give us 200 points and when we use them all we have to want a day for just 100 points that is just messed up, all the way up. We can at least have 400 points if y'all want to do that!😡😡. But out of that point the app is pretty cool. Y'all just need less time to want for points and let us dance. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE 👌🏽"", ""Best game I could Think of! I'm glad I downloaded Just Dance!! Thanks for making The wonderful, one and only, Just Dance. Hope you all have a nice and amazing day and don't let others let you down on this wonderful day (everyday.) And whenever possible to be kind, be kind. And it's always possible.

UwU"", ""Hey, UBISOFT OR JUST DANCE. I would like to say that the app would be awesome if I could play it, because I have a TV but there's no TV feature you could only choose PC, chromecast and Tablet. I hope that there will be a TV feature one day There's only chromecast that can connect to the tv but I don't have it. Please add a TV without chromecast or anything else feature. Thank You! I would rate it 5/5 stars if I could play it on the TV screen"", ""It was fun while it lasted. I only got to play this game for just one day aka two songs max. Either increase the amount of coins we can have or lower the price of each song. I also found out that there are free songs, but I am not going to check every single song to see if it's free or not, no one has time for that. And no, there's no category specifically for the free songs, and I'm not sure if it's the app itself or my phone. Do not reply to this review. We want you to fix the problem. Now."", ""Downloaded this because my kids love it. The game won't stay connected to Chromecast. It connects, makes a loud screeching noise then takes me back to the TV's home screen."", ""It's good that you can play without a console, but 1 song per day? And the fact that I can only collect up to 200 coins! It's just ridiculous, I mean at least we should be able to collect some more coins by signing in every day or watching ads but only 200 coins! I think if the game was a little bit more accesible for people who can't afford to buy VIP it would be perfect."", ""The game is fun, but you can only play twice, it will be better if you changes it to more coins to play or put free song that you can play. We liked the game but only we can't play more than twice and there's no free song to play. Please make a chance so we can play more, if not i'm gonna delete it, because it's a waste of place on my phone. Thank you."", ""I have an excellent internet connection but it can't connect to the server. :( I installed it on P30 Lite"", 'Having a serious problem connecting with chrome cast... I only succeeded for one time, and the rest just never work out. :( I had a wonderful time first, but later on being pretty disappointed. Hope it would be fix Ps. I even redownload the app, but still the same.', 'Good game play and fun music. However your limited to 2, even if you get kicked due to internet. (Which really sucks when it happens twice thats your limit.) Coins take to long to recharge. Add watch videos/adds for coins option would make it better. Also once you pay for a song you should be have it permanently or at least a few more chance at that song.', 'I love the game and I love playing it, but I hate the fact that we can only play once a day.Not everyone can afford buyng a VIP version of the game or the one on a Playstation. The game is really interesting, but the new politics suck. I would rate it 5 stars only if I didnt have this issue with the coins, everything works fine, no bugs .I would be really happy if you see this comment and do something about the problem.Thank you.', 'The game is pretty good but it has some problems. First, the fact that you only have the amount of coins to play 2 songs is just tedious. And there is a glitch where if you add a certain amount of songs to your favorites, the next song that you press will automatically move you up to your favorites. Please patch that glitch in an update because its driving me insane.', 'I really hate the fact that you can only play 1 song a day, like it is so annoying. The first version of the game was way better. I wish they brought back having free songs and getting coins from those songs. The second version is a big drop. To be positive, it is a great form of exercise and is also fun to play with your friends. Overall, you developers need to implement all of the good stuff from that version to this version of the game. Now I might uninstall the game.', ""It's very good especially without no console, but it won't work for my tv."", ""I mean great game fun to play but the coin system is just unfair. I have to wait 24 hours to play 1 round. just 1. it's stupid. there are people who don't have jobs because they are kids and their parents won't pay for VIP. or their parents can't afford VIP. can you do something about it like possibly make it so you get 100 coins every 1-2 hours instead of 24 because Im pretty sure no one wants to wait that long for 1 round"", 'I would give it five but for some reason it keeps kicking me out in a middle of the song while i use it on my phone it has nothing to do with the storage. I used it for more than an hour the other day it worked fine up until yesterday now it just kicks me out.', ""Buggy af! Songs don't play properly (if at all), dancers either freeze on screen or don't show at all, and yet the game still scores movements even though there's nothing to hear or see. Backing out of a frozen song will lose you precious coins with no way to get them back. Since this happens pretty much always, it's a huge waste. This has been a consistent problem for years, at this rate I don't believe the app will ever work properly. It's too bad as the concept is amazing otherwise...""]"

I've been doing tiles since the first one and I loved it since the first one. I realize that they've been taking a lot of people suggestions and pudding. Big-time stars and songs into their tiles and it's really nice to have a beads to the tile that makes it so much easier to get past the levels now. I just love"", 'This game is too rushed and developers are very lazy,the ads are everywhere even when you dont have internet,but it loads then you have to reload the game. Its a wastes of a space and time for your mobile device.', ""While the idea is interesting, this game fails massively on keeping a new user interested because it pushes TONS of ads down your throat from the very beginning and at every step. If you fail one tile, which is bound to happen when you're a beginner, you are served 20 seconds of ad... EACH time! Of course, you can't skip those ads because are of the nasty kind that have a timer and can't be cancelled. Honestly, a few ads and I might have considered buying the game, but this? No way."", ""The game never picks up when you hit a tile, the music audio is bad, and it doesn't give you any variety of songs. I don't recommend this game, but you play whatever floats your boat."", ""I gave this game a 1 star because on the the advertiser is says pick out of 3 songs for one you don't do that and whenever you click on one it doesn't count so if your looking for a piano tiles game I would recommend piano tiles 2"", ""The game in itself is okay, other than the notes don't match with the song. I mean, it's like you're playing a game with music to listen to, not playing the music. The developers are lazy, after you get the 3 stars you move on to the crowns and all they do is speed up the music. Finally, there are too many adverts. After watching 3 advertisements to regain your lifes on the song, they play another 30 second advert. This app will waste your time. I suggest you DO NOT play it. :(("", ""It take's alot of time to loud and get in also it take's to much time to get in and play the song i'm going to give.you a 4 and a half star's pleas fix it."", 'This game is so good!!!!

I always play this at my house and my dad's work! It is a awesome game! It does not have to many adds, and my favorite part of the game is I get to listen to song's wall I play!!!! Everyone should play this game!!! It is a free game, and it takes 1 minute to download!!!! All the people in the world should play this game!!!"", ""I think it's a good app as compared to many others because in this app the most important thing is that it need full attention or concentration .. so you have the complain that I can't focus during study so just play this game before study for 4 to 5 minutes..... Then you will see your focus.... And the most important thing that during playing this game , you will enjoy the music also.."", 'l liked this game alot especially when there are so interesting and nice songs..the only part i didnt like was when there is a very long add after every turn..I would suggest to remove that problem or if we ever try to switch off the internet because of the adds ..the game also doesnt play without internet connection!!!!《《~~', 'The most heart touching game yeah i m saying it play with purpose seems like you are playing the song when you do it perfectly .True, waht a geniius mind before this game...']"

Great music never gets boring."", ""I used to really like this app. Then it stopped honoring my prizes for challenges I completed such as the treasure hunt and I still got notifications that there had been an update, but never got the extra game that comes with updates. I be have spent months trying to get this figured out with customer service... Especially since I put a lot of money toward this game, and all I ever hear is they don't know. They're working on it.

Decent game some of the levels tho are ridiculously difficult tho unless you buy powerups which some of us dont want to do. I also don't think its fair for the player to have one level labeled hard, a regular level or two, and then another level labeled hard. Seriously! Space out the difficult levels instead of putting them so close together."", 'I really love playing this game, however, I get upset sometimes because the levels are almost ""impossible"" to complete, and takes too much time doing so.

Way too many ads for gambling and no opt out feature for those and other vice ads. Now they have raised the price of ""free"" power ups to five times what it was last week.

Today it fell to ZERO.😢', 'Love this game and the music is groovy!', ""I love this disco concept!!!! the only bad thing I have to say is that the area thats played on should be bigger, it's very posdoble because there's wasted space around it.

Really how can anybody find fault with a game that makes you SMILE 😁 I wouldn't change a thing. It's original in graphics & music choice.. just all works. To the Developers 🤗 GREAT JOB ! Nothing out there like it. Just remember they'll always be critics, but the majority of your reviews are 👍 THANK YOU!!! for offering it free. You nailed it Disco wise. I should know i was there.. The attention to detail is excellent & the mirror ball in game play so FUN! 🕺"", ""I really liked this game until I realized how greedy the developers are. You have to spenda fortune to get past many levels as you move up. It's pointless to play a game that becomes so difficult it's not fun any more."", ""Love the game! I'm from the disco era so the theme is fun and challenging. I would give it 5 stars if it were not for the glitches in the tournament part. But still worth playing every day. the music is great! and don't know why I get a sense of accomplishment when I can kill the pig...🤣"", ""Would give 5 stars BUT..... After you complete each puzzle you gotta sit there while it racks up points, which is time consuming and a waste of MY time. After awhile you just wanna stop playing. I mean can't you add a skip button like simular games?!?! Other than that, this game is freaking AWESOME!!!!!😉😉✌✌"", ""I have had this game installed on my phone for awhile and installed all the updates.

Lastly, I think the 24hr wait for only 100 coins is too long, if it's going to make us wait 24hrs for coins it should at least be 200 coins or shortening the time to wait for coins."", ""This game is soooooooo cool and fun and one of the best games ever and I mean it isn't bad but the reason why I give four stars is because sometimes it doesn't load and kicks me out the game but this game is really cool but this game is the best and I like when they update it and how they add super star and mega star and I really really love the updates I would like to give it five but it's just one problem I have but for crying out loud this is the best game it might be even better than roblox"", ""I set it up and pressed dance, I charged my profile for coins but couldn't proporly connect to the second screen so canceled it and didnt back the coins, I tried again and the same thing happened.

That reason happens to be the coin system. Yes, I know VIP is there to make money, understandable and trust me I don't have a problem with it, but I don't feel like paying for VIP and I think it takes too long to get coins. I just got the game and already blew my 200 coins. I feel that the wait time for coins should be shorter, and/or you should earn coins by playing.

I really despise that sort of game. Would play again if I could have unlimited trys per day but until then I will play something else... It's sad to see this. The game has so much potential but flopped because of the price."", ""This app is a really, really good idea to make, but the problem is, the coin system is very annoying, another star taken because for some reason, all of a sudden the game is rigged, I'm missing gold moves even though I did it properly, I dont really wanna complain about that because other than that I'm doing really good as a dancer too, Thanks for adding superstar and megastar to the game, I was really surprised when I played just dance for the first time in a few months and got superstar."", 'This would be an amazing experience if you could play the song you ""purchase"" all day instead of having to ""pay"" everytime.

I just find it like a throw off part of the game because you have to wait 24 hours for 100 coins and the songs cost a lot which it's a really fast game experience, it's a bit unfair that we only have 200 coins every 24 hours and I'm not willing to wait every day to get 200 coins. The VIP doesn't last very long but it's okay."", ""I like this since the first time I played it on PS4. As for this I'd like it to be easier to join the room and since I cast it to my TV I would like graphics to be just a little improved As for controls it is annoying to keep the phone in hand while dancing, if it is doable maybe you can do something to detect the moves via camera just like on PS4? In that case the game would be perfect. Anyway, I gave you five stars for the incentive"", ""The app is good and everything. The reason I give this a three star because its takes too long to get coins and its good you're trying to keep the VIP cheap, but not everyone has enough money. The first time I joined, I only got 200 and it wasn't enough. Can you at least put one hour to earn coins? That would be awesome. Other than that, the game is pretty good."", ""The app is pretty good the only thing that we need is more points because they give us 200 points and when we use them all we have to want a day for just 100 points that is just messed up, all the way up.

And the fact that I can only collect up to 200 coins! It's just ridiculous, I mean at least we should be able to collect some more coins by signing in every day or watching ads but only 200 coins!

(Which really sucks when it happens twice thats your limit.) Coins take to long to recharge. Add watch videos/adds for coins option would make it better. Also once you pay for a song you should be have it permanently or at least a few more chance at that song.', 'I love the game and I love playing it, but I hate the fact that we can only play once a day.Not everyone can afford buyng a VIP version of the game or the one on a Playstation. The game is really interesting, but the new politics suck. I would rate it 5 stars only if I didnt have this issue with the coins, everything works fine, no bugs .I would be really happy if you see this comment and do something about the problem.Thank you.', 'The game is pretty good but it has some problems. First, the fact that you only have the amount of coins to play 2 songs is just tedious. And there is a glitch where if you add a certain amount of songs to your favorites, the next song that you press will automatically move you up to your favorites. Please patch that glitch in an update because its driving me insane.', 'I really hate the fact that you can only play 1 song a day, like it is so annoying. The first version of the game was way better. I wish they brought back having free songs and getting coins from those songs. The second version is a big drop. To be positive, it is a great form of exercise and is also fun to play with your friends. Overall, you developers need to implement all of the good stuff from that version to this version of the game. Now I might uninstall the game.', ""It's very good especially without no console, but it won't work for my tv."", ""I mean great game fun to play but the coin system is just unfair. I have to wait 24 hours to play 1 round. just 1. it's stupid. there are people who don't have jobs because they are kids and their parents won't pay for VIP. or their parents can't afford VIP. can you do something about it like possibly make it so you get 100 coins every 1-2 hours instead of 24 because Im pretty sure no one wants to wait that long for 1 round"", 'I would give it five but for some reason it keeps kicking me out in a middle of the song while i use it on my phone it has nothing to do with the storage. I used it for more than an hour the other day it worked fine up until yesterday now it just kicks me out.', ""Buggy af! Songs don't play properly (if at all), dancers either freeze on screen or don't show at all, and yet the game still scores movements even though there's nothing to hear or see. Backing out of a frozen song will lose you precious coins with no way to get them back. Since this happens pretty much always, it's a huge waste. This has been a consistent problem for years, at this rate I don't believe the app will ever work properly. It's too bad as the concept is amazing otherwise...""]"

That happened after the recent updates. Second, why is the drums not responding whenever I play along with my music? The crash, hi-hat, toms respond except for the snare.

I had to tap to close ads almost as much as I tapped on the drums themselves! There's an ad after practically every action. Truly awful. I didn't even bother to evaluate the app before uninstalling after just 10 mins. Greedy developers, shame on you. It's rare I post a review but this one goes too far."", ""Okay, you guys seriously have to fix the button icon issue. It's so irritating for my music to stop playing due to the play/pause/rec/etc buttons being on screen all the time whenever I'm using the app. I already addressed this issue once, I've seen no improvement even though you guys replied to my review.

The new update just messed everything up! When you tap on the drums there's a milli second delay. It even impossible to make a smooth beat because the sound comes after you tap the drums. You just wasted my money to remove the adds permanently! Please fix it!"", ""Infuriating! There's a delay and, most of the time, also cant register a tap. I cant simultaneously hit the kit too. This is utterly unacceptable for a drum simulating app. How can you expect it to function like how it suppose to? What is wrong with you guys??"", ""The best music game, why? It let you do what you want like learn, play songs that you like and even change drums. The game is weekly updated it's up to date. There are more then 15 drums to choose from and every week new drums come out. You can do all the things I mentioned offline. That is why I said that its the best! Thank you!"", ""This is a fun drum app. Lots of different sets with different sounds. You can also make custom sets to get your perfect kit.

Saves battery and is easier on the eyes at night', ""App has been fantastic so far, I'd maybe suggest building a drum pad screen or like a lunch pad maybe? Just something to save custom kits. Either way, its awesome. Though, I did notice with this recent update, there's some delay between taps and sound now, so that makes playing pretty challenging now lol"", ""I love this app, but after some of the most recent updates I found a bug. When I try to connect audio output to for instance headphones by Bluetooth or wire I have to face huge audio transmission delay. In older versions I have not such issue :/. Maybe playing asynchronously an audio doesn't work properly or callback is sticking somewhere in event loop? Maybe this issue is related strictly to I/O files operations? Oh I forgot to mention, I'm using Mi 9SE, and Redmi Note 3 Pro"", 'Fun to play.

Let your baby choose any kid piano which he or she likes to play.
3) Our magic piano acquaints children with a number of domestic animals and also with animal sounds. These animals for babies include: a cat, a dog, a donkey, a wolf, a duck, a cow, a goat and a parrot. So, toddlers will get to know the appearance of various animals and also how they “talk”.
4) Our baby entertainer contains kids music and piano melodies.There is also a record and play back feature in the simulator. It means that a baby can create his or her own melody and record it. 
5) Our virtual piano is available in several languages - English, Spanish, Russian and some others. All our learning games are voiced by native speakers with perfect pronunciation and clear diction.
6) The preschool piano is suitable for girls and boys age 2, age 3, for 4 to 5 year kid and 5 years of age.

8) Playing our piano for kindergarten contributes greatly to the development of fine motor skills, imagination, intelligence, perseverance in achieving goals, they train memory and attention. Such musical games also develop an ear for music.
9) The piano with letters on the keys has also a great entertainment potential for young kids. It causes much enthusiasm and can take the attention of the baby for a long time. 
10) Our piano for beginners has a very bright, clear and intuitive interface so even the youngest children will not have the slightest difficulty to understand how to play it.
How to play:
Start the piano and choose one of 3 bubbles on the main screen leading to 3 different keyboard
Upon going through the pink bubble, a child will see an eight-keyed piano in rainbow colors. The ordinary tones of our baby entertainer produced by each key are clear and distinct, ranging from Do to Do. The names of notes are indicated above the keyboard to know how they are spelled. The mid-day blue sky and a tree branch with a couple of flying bees as the background, there and everywhere create an engaging atmosphere.
The green bubble will bring a kid to a fence with a bunch of cats. Just touch one bottom plank for the cat to jump and go meow. The kitties are distinguished not only by tonality; each cat has its own emotions, body type and coat pattern.
The instrument behind the yellow bubble is topped with a range of animals. Swiping across the row of keys will deliver a cacophony of discordant animal voices, which can however be harmonized by turning on the demo melody. During the main melody, the young pianist can insert the sounds of animals that match the sound and tone. The resulting melody can be recorded and reproduced. Such a fun game will not leave any child indifferent.
As a rule, children are fond of playing musical instruments, but not all parents have the opportunity to buy a real xylophone or a toy piano. Our free musical piano was created to help such parents. The piano sounds are as close to the original sound as possible. In addition, the game will give the kid an idea of what an octave and tone is and will develop a musical ear","Entertaining and educational game for toddlers to learn musical notes, animals.","1,000,000+",1000000,4.321716,7503,1172,0.0,True,USD,True,13M,4.1,GoKids!,5796709972154726091,toplinesolutionsltd@gmail.com,,https://www.facebook.com/notes/gokids/stork-studio-limited-privacy-policy/1105119492835798,5796709972154726091,Educational,GAME_EDUCATIONAL,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/CZ69a5n3NkaH8rCV-3kSrKx4xOWbJFg6OUHkMKCLAGiqwqK9PJjUez29X4h_xHHhNQ,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/WbZaf9iV9k5uiMjxf0wkakYJ7ZyAChAjEH-9xoZW20HE_MGC0Y9lJr6lJbO1_l7KqeA,Everyone,,True,True,"Oct 20, 2014",1575956197,1.4.3,Minor fixes,"['Adds are a no go in baby Games!', 'Application for toddlers with adds.

I played the first hour or two but then this app sat unplayed for years and I'm finally uninstalling it after admitting to myself that I'm just never going to launch it again. It was just not compelling enough to draw me back in and there are other more rewarding ways to spend time."", ""I have just completed 26% of the whole game. For me that was enough. What to say... The game is for those who love something unusual - story, controls, fight mode. It's original. I reduced rate for no response from support for about 1,5 month. There's a screen resolution problem on Xiaomi Mi A2 Lite."", ""Such a great graphics but the rotation in this game are weird and i don't like it because it's not comfortable and not even full screen (30% is a black screen for me) (on Galaxy S10+)"", 'I liked the artwork, but endless pointless walking around was a bit boring.

The first 10 minutes felt like a chore, so it didn't get another chance."", 'One of the first games i fell in love with. Incredible soundtrack, simple but brutal story. Love even thinking about this game.', 'I really want to like this game but the controls are not clean enough. I also got stuck without a menu or any way to move after picking up the book and dying on the first quest. Another downside is that every time you observe something, the game keeps a little bar in the corner to tweet the observation. Seeing references to Twitter throughout the game just kills any semblance of immersion. This is only judging based off of the first 10 minutes of gameplay, because it glitched out.', ""Worth every Penny, however lack of optimisation regarding screen aspect ratio is to be noted. In my case, the game's aspect ratio was 16:9 although my device had 19:9 ratio."", ""This game is amazing, I haven't even finished but it's just amazing. The music, the experience, everything is so unique. But I have one complain, not enough to make it down to four stars (or maybe?), the thing is the sensitivity of the rotation is way too high. Sometimes my phone is making a 15° or less and the game thinks I rotated the device and goes battle mode. This is frustrating some times but wasn't able to make me not enjoy the game."", ""I enjoyed the game, but the battle system (rotating your phone and then waiting for the enemy to attack you so you can counterattack them) got old pretty fast and ended up being more of a tedious pain than an intense fighting experience--the boss fights were kind of fun, though. The game is way too sensitive to even slight rotations; also, the main antagonist wasn't nearly as frightening once you realize that all it does is trigger another boring fight when it catches you. Story was alright--it started off strong, but last momentum as the game progressed; in some ways this game squandered its potential."", ""really enjoy the art and sound design. the way the game does character development is super nice. a very contemplative atmosphere. love the sense of humor. ui is clunky for some operations - sometimes even introducing problems where i can't switch between game modes this bug prevents me from progressing beyond about 30% of the game. at this point i am unable to exit sworcery mode after the 2 eagles/sun puzzle. I would rate it 5 stars for the design and execution (and idiosyncracies) IF i could play it through on my device (moto g+ or something)"", 'This was an extremely polished experience with beautiful pixel art and gameplay that works perfectly with the narrative. Some parts of the game might not be spelled out for the player, but the feeling of discovery and experimentation is a part of the theme. Those elements, along with a near-perfect soundtrack, makes for a game that is 100% worth the money.', 'This game is an amazing work of art with great visuals, music, and story. the story takes the traditional hero power fantasy of most games and flips it on its head. the protagonist starts off strong and healthy but every progression towards her goal leaves the protagonist weaker and weaker until she is struggling to continue forward, limping and coughing blood, but you press on. the game is mysterious, meta, quirky, and unique. highly recommended to adventure game fans.', ""I don't know if it's a glitch or just me but the controls in this are terrible. I picked up that book, got killed by the demon boss and now I can't move anywhere. I tried reloading the game, restarting my phone and even looking at walkthroughs but it looks like I wasn't even supposed to do this quest for a while (even though it's the first quest in the game). What's worse, I can't even get to the main menu to start a new game, it just starts me back at the same place where I can't move."", ""its a good game but i couldn't keep Dark moon long enough to do spells which meant alot of walking around. I got bored and went off and did something else. it does look really good."", 'ok Omg graphic, harkens back to the days of a commodore 64 and sprites. To charge money for this game really, bots must given it its rating, sorry this game is terrible, to compare to zelda even on the first Nintendo is a huge grasp at some pretty lame straws. play with head sets, oh dear this must be a gamers jokes get others to listen to pathetic music whilst playing a block pathetic game. Sorry If I could give a negative 5 stars this has it buy it play it be amazed, yeah right. Uninstalled', ""Crashes often. Haven't been able to play on Galaxy S10+."", ""Though the story, what little there seems to be, isn't very interesting and I didn't want to continue playing anyway, what made me want to throw my phone in frustration was how if I tapped the phone at all the game would rotate into combat mode."", 'When I started playing this months ago it worked fine, but now it crashes every single time before getting to gameplay. I would have rated it much higher on completion because I was really enjoying it before. It is a shame.', 'Game kept crashing within a second or two of launch.

Fix the crashing issues at least and I'll see about re-downloading the game."", 'Crashes when picking up items, happens pretty often.', 'I like how random things can get -- the enemies, bullet types and bosses are randomized every run. Though my only gripe is that the red glowing border visual effect that appears when your character is about to die in one hit. It\'s really distracting and makes it harder to dodge bullets especially those colored red. Maybe it\'s intentional being an example ""interface screw"" trope but maybe it would be better in my opinion if the red border was toned down a little especially for smaller screens?', ""I don't regret buying this at all! A feeling I seldom feel on the Play store. This game is a bullet hell with a pleasant taste of pop culture references and well crafted gameplay. Only mobile game I'd play more than once a day for sure."", 'It was a great game but now it just crash out or locks up and the 2nd game mode is gone', 'From 5* to 1* in a few days.

Original take on the shmup genre with some random \nregeneration and therefore playability, the characters pixel graphics and \nmad cap weapons really make it stand out from rest. Starts slow but \nprogression should be manageable for newbies and challenging when you get a \nfew rounds in for the more manic shmup'er aided by smooth Movement and \ncontrols.

This game is easy enough that I want to play it, but challenging enough to keep me engaged. There isn't a time element involved, the game goes at my pace. The art work and color choices are a delight. And they add new mini games every week so there's built in variety. The game gives you a little ration of power-ups as daily and game prizes, but you can buy more if you really want to. I not only kept this game, I wrote a review."", ""I think the app is great. My problem is that I wish we could have more than 5 lives and I wish the levels weren't so difficult. Level 223 is absolutely impossible to pass. Plus I wish there wasn't a small amount of trys either. The levels are too hard to get through mainly because there aren't enough trys for you to finally pass it."", 'I love the fabulous illustrated graphics, the overall design and user interface friendliness, the color blind mode which sometimes is a nice alternative option, and of course that music which is a masterpiece of its own. True geniuses behind the development of this great game. Congratulations to the whole team.', 'Very fun. Stays interesting and challenging. Attractive colors and designs although the red backgrounds are a bit hard on the eyes. If you think you can\'t progress without purchasing, you probably just aren\'t that good at setting up squares for yourself. There is some strategy to planning future moves. I\'ve made it over 300 levels without buying anything and don\'t feel ""bombarded"" by purchasing options.', 'An amazing game! Most are the same when it comes to games where you have to connect three but in two dots you only have to connect two dots. I know it\'s not a big change but even the little things count when it comes to making a ""one of a kind game""! Also the music just ties it all together, the cherry on top! For this fun and calming game I would rate it 5/5.', ""I really like the game, though you do have to purchase powerups if you're going to get past levels. I love how there's always something else to do, it feels like more than one game. I wish the extra treasure hunt would come back, where you have to find all the items. I really liked that but haven't seen it since I first got the game."", 'The game emphasizes buying items too much. There numerous things to buy and they keep pushing them in your face. They also do a poor job of explaining the mechanics of the game. There is a progression, but they push you challenges and such that use things you not seen and your left guessing. Overall interesting concept, but poorly implemented.', ""It's a great game. Except I had to get a new phone. And since I didnt know to get a restore code or player id before hand I have to start over. I've never had that problem with any other game I use google play to sign in with."", ""I don't get why this game is highly rated the gameplay is similar to candycrush, expect you get annoying popups about anything and everything between and sometimes during levels. They also have the candy crush life system, which makes it annoying cause you might not get to play when you have time and of course purchase of in-game currency is advertised every other second and horridly expensive."", ""Fun addiction. There are a variety of challenges. Most games have been pretty easy. I am baffled by how to get to settings. Every time I tap what looks like the icon there are no settings available. I'm also confused about the objective for some games and don't find the explanations easily. The games I do understand however are fun."", 'Not worth the time.. Once you get to higher levels, the game has ridiculous algorithm at the backend. You play a game for good time pass. This one is certainly not. It keeps getting tougher to cross the levels when you cross 300. You have to use boost else you can not cross the levels. Using boost continuously means you need to spend money.', ""I really like the game but I wish you would give more than a second to read the message in between levels. There's one I've been trying to read ever since I started playing that starts out...playing for gold and high scores? No clue but I assume it tells you how in the next sentence. Others I haven't been able to read at all they disappear so fast"", ""Not as advertised. I clicked the download to play the game that was advertised. What's the point of the bait and switch? Why not just make the game that looked interesting enough to get people to click the advertisement? I tried a few levels and this game was not challenging or interesting."", ""This is the best designed mobile game I've ever played - from the anesthetics, to the experience, sound effects and humor. Everything looks and feels just in place, and new content keeps pouring in! Sometimes I open it just to witness how gorgeous it is. Seriously."", ""I really like the game but I'm not paying $4 just to access 50 coins that I supposedly earned while playing, that is just not happening and seems a bit outrageous. Also, please include a setting which allows me to turn off push notifications, or someone please reply and tell me where to disable them because I didn't see it in the settings menus and there are way too many."", ""My boyfriend and I have been playing two dots since we got to know each other..and that's like 1 year ago. Both of us loves solving puzzles and keep us calm. We also challenge each other to see who leads the game. I am at level 400++, never had to buy a boost. I watched the ads. And that will give me the boost that I need. For those of you who complained so much about having to buy boost, you guys just suck at this game."", ""Really love the game in general - keep up the good work. Agree with points made by others on social media that win streaks should be optional as they can take some of the challenge out of the game. Also why has the number of 'watch video for free life/booster box' seemingly now been limited to so many per day or certain times of day?"", ""Excellent! A very relaxing game, not bright on the eyes and the music is nice and calming. I suffer with Migraines that are generally caused by light. This game, by not having really bright features, has helped my find something I can enjoy, that helps me relax and I know won't cause me to have an attack. Thank you! 😊"", 'Games change on a regular basis to keep you from getting bored. In some cases though, the colors are just too hard to see or tell apart, e.g. coral and pink dots. I suggest more ""find the hidden objects"" without having to pay for the last rounds. I suggest you gain points to pay for play.', 'I got a notification saying ""breathe, it\'s time to play two dots"". If there is an app notification from two dots that would make me want to play this game again, it would be entertaining, appropriately impersonal. I spent the time on this review because the first image that popped into my mind was something like ""accidentally dystopian"".', 'Love this game, such cute graphics, very nice to look at and fun to play. I love when they have special object hunting games and I wish they would do then more often!', ""Love this game! There are so many levels and I love that they can get very difficult, so you have your fair share of challenges. It's my favorite game to play when I'm just relaxing or have any down time."", ""I loved the game, but now that I have a new phone, I lost my progress. Oh, I can save progress with Facebook? That's great for people who use Facebook. Here's an idea - this is an Android app. Use Google's platform to track and record progress, just like other games."", ""The recent addition of streak bonuses take the fun out of the game. Many boards just become stupidly easy, others become impossible, either way strategy is taken away. Used to be a balanced, semi-challenging game that was nice to play on the subway while listening to something, now it's just mindless"", ""I like the game, but when I click on the option to watch a video for an extra life or box, it just goes back to the extra life or box repeatedly. The video won't play."", ""I'd been looking for this kind of game and was so happy to find it. But it's become apparent that you really can't progress without making purchases. I think I'll just forever be stuck at level 55 because without boosts it's practically impossible. So :/ will be uninstalling"", 'Challenging yet fun, this game keeps your brain working in a way that is fun and refreshing. I love that when I connect through Facebook I am competing with friends scores without constantly being prompted to share or tag anyone or send invites. This is the least annoying game and no ads!! Love.', ""So much potential but let down. This game would be so therapeutic if it wasn't constantly hounding into buy coins and also, making it almost impossible on later rounds to proceed without paying."", ""Great game but can feel like a money grab. It needs better ways to earn gold as a lot of levels can't be done without the help items, and they cost a lot of gold and there's no way to collect that much gold without paying. I'd happily watch adverts to earn them."", ""A challenging game, with enough variety to keep you interested. Some of the levels are fiendishly hard, but with patience, if you keep playing, you ultimately get past them. The help function could be better, though. The explanations just aren't all that good."", ""Meh - Beautifully laid out and well made but far too pushy for in app purchases, with over 300 games on my phone right bow this is by far the worst I've play seen. Also no colourblind option of help so very tough for me to play in that sense."", 'It seems set up to make you have to spend money. When having to meet a specific number of color matches, it will stop giving that specific color or only give a couple. Its frustrating.', 'Of all the games that are ""just like this"" - this is by far the best one I\'ve played. It\'s kept interesting with frequent events and amny creative elements added in as you progress.', ""Just a fun enjoyable game all around. Although paying for the chest thing is kinda weird, but you don't need to for success!"", ""Not the game advertised. The game the ad showed had a stack of balls, 3 pegs, and you couldn't put a bigger ball on top of a smaller one. I clicked on it and got this crappy line game. Stop lying in advertisments!"", ""Would be a cool game, but it changes too quickly between levels to read the instructions or tips or whatever it is. Feels like I'm missing important info for that level. But I can't read it."", ""Could not get past level 35, it was a fun game, but the levels where there is fire are a timed event, and I don't like games that force you to complete them in a small amount of time."", 'Game itself is minimalistic and clean but nothing special. However I really admire all the artwork. I was just staring at all the moving doodles to the final level and it all was exceptional.', ""You can get pretty far without making a purchase but you eventually need to make them to get through certain levels. It's a fun mind-numbing game that awards you with freebies if you are willing to watch ad videos along the way."", ""My best friend and I love this game. It's analytical and has some strategy, but it also has cool colors and asthetic animations. The music is also fun and relaxing, and the game is split up so it's easy to set and achieve goals. 10/10""]"

Thank you for playing <3","['I have play this game since 2013 on iphone.. This game really fun.. I reach up to 3072 with high score of 214818..

You have to watch ads for every life🤣 Wait for whoever rips off this idea and does the game right 👍', ""I love this game or loved it until it kept freezing each time I attempted to play.

I will continue to look for updates, but I had to uninstall the game.', ""I had originally bought this game several years ago. After moving from one phone to another, I had forgotten to reinstall the game and just thought about it recently. As I had originally purchased it, I thought that all I had to do was restore my purchase. This does not seem to be an option. Now I'm being asked to pay $5.99 for a game I already owned. Great way to keep making money by screwing over your existing customers! Thanks, guys!"", 'Well this game has certainly gone downhill since a few years ago.

Not only that but this game doesn't need internet!!! That is such a great thing to have because when I'm bored I can play. The goals are simply and easy but completing them is challenging which is exactly what a great game should have."", 'Let me start off by saying, I really enjoy this game. I used to play it all the time on my BLU Studio X Plus, but since I swapped back to my HTC One m8, I cannot play anymore. It shows the SMG logo,then promptly closes. Feedback and/or fixes would be much appreciated.', ""If more challenges were added, or if you could at least pick the one you're doing, the game would be much more enjoyable, in my opinion. Also, maybe if you could stay pit without having to make a move for a bit more time, it would be much easier to complete the challenges. Maybe a setting for that should be done? Other than that, the design is amazing, and the gameplay is quickly addicting."", 'But one star because the ads constantly pop up to fill the whole screen immediately after you lose, causing you to accidentally click the ad while simply trying to hit restart.

That's literally the only thing that I don't like about this game."", ""Love the game,  however,  it gets boring when I can't even make it to 100 without dying. Exploding because you don't move soon enough is irritating. And so is dying because you have to wait for the walls to move before you can move ahead. Also,  dying because you move just barely too close,  but not touching, the side of the spike wall? Irritating as well. Y'all should make it so you can choose modes of the game.

And the game is essentially one long timing puzzle but it gives you time limits making it literally impossible to do some so it forces you to just keep trying and trying. Overall fun mechanic though."", 'This game is a blast to play, but I have one major gripe. Sometimes in the middle of game play the Google play ""signing in"" pop up comes up and once it goes away the game starts over from the beginning.

I overall love it, and recommend it if you are a fan of good games.', 'Great game involving lots of skill because of the difficulty, the style is simplistic but works very well and is well developed, and it has some interesting themes about disatisfaction in life, which gives it a bit of artistic value. But fix the glitch where you start with only 1 or 2 lives instead of 3 when starting a game of endless mode, it happens kind if often, like 1 out of 5 times.', ""This game. It's beautiful. It reminds me of Undertale. They are both games with deep story while most people think it's just the gameplay. Also it has so many options for different types of gamemodes. It's kind of hard to really express my feelings on such games. When a game has this type of story it is great, like this game, probably the greatest mobile game I've played. I honestly just keep playing it for the story. Also it's such a simple game with awesome graphics, background and soundtrack."", 'The modern gaming world is filled with terrible cash grabs and grimy business practices. This game, however goes the route of the Witcher 3 and just makes the game so darn good that even pirates would eventually buy it full price! If you like Geometry Dash, you will love this.

Even though a lot of it has to be purchased, there are also a lot of free levels. And there is only about an ad every 15 tries and not some ads constantly on your screen.

It brings challenge, it's relaxing, and it's never repetitive. I'm in wave 600+ in the continuance challenge. So many challenges, and the paid add-ons are so cheap and worth it.

Best of all, there is no lag, loading, or really any stutter in anything, and my 90Hz display just makes this simple game look like a AAA title 😸"", 'One of the best games I have ever played with grate music and a great narrator. The downside is that you need to buy the premium version to play more level, which means the players can only play the level of the main story and the endless version. The other levels are not available. I only needed three day to finish all the chapters of the main story.

Not always easy and sometimes frustrating (when you're so close to ending a level and you make a wrong move) but that's a good thing! It's not a game where you mindlessly tap to get coins or whatever and claim daily rewards and feel like you're always winning.

I hope I could buy this game but I can't...... 😑😑😒"", ""Fun way to burn some spare time! I made it to the final level with more than 600 balls. It's easy to get through the whole game but a challenge to master each level. I haven't tried the more difficult modes of play. I stick with classic mode. But I just wanted to let the developers know that they did a wonderful job with this app!"", ""Amazing game with good graphics and a simple yet diverse map. There are 3 different tutorial variations from the beginning and the glass is randomized, I think. I dont know what happened but I must've triggered something and I got to checkpoint infinity somehow. Small Easter eggs and good graphics bundled into a small well designed game deserves my rating."", ""Awesome test of a player's ability to very quickly assess a rapidly and constantly changing environment, accurately identify and neutralize all qualifying as well as all hostile targets, all while remaining calm and alert; mindful of available powerups and conserving ammunition where possible. The gauntlet changes slightly each run too... So you can forget memorizing a set pattern for every restart through the course. 3 thumbs up!"", ""I love this game! Totally addicting and difficulty and speed build up at a good pace. It seems really simple but gets more intense. Frustrating if you do not upgrade to paid version because you have to start over but it's not even a big deal. Enjoy playing anyway. Good game."", 'Love it but I wish I didn\'t bave to either start at the beginning everytime I play even if I hit multiple checkpoints... Unless I actually purchase the "" Premium"" version... Thats all I don\'t like about it but other than that I absolutly love it..', ""It's a good game and all, but maybe once you get into a new checkpoint, we can recieve some more balls. And, if you like to smash things, then this game is for you! Although you can lose, you'll just start oveelr and get to smash more! I do recommend getting it."", 'This game is both additive and relaxing at the same time. A very unique way of destressing at the end of the day. I like this the mostly because of its simplicity and the hand eye coordination that makes this so stimulating, a must have game for your mobile! Well done:-)', ""This game is so so so soooooo interesting that I just can't describe it.........From many days I was finding an interesting offline game because my daily 1GB daily plan gets over very soon so after not some time but many time I got this game and if you relate my situation then I'll prefer you this game😋😋😋😋😋"", ""Havint played this game in like a year but I still got it, I got to demigod on my first try. Endless modes layout has changed alot since I played it, I don't know if it random or always like that but it's very fun and I wish I could get the permium but I don't like to pay for stuff on apps."", ""Good game m8. Idk if my last review sent last time so I'm doing it again. The only bad part to me is that you need premium to start with checkpoints or play different different game modes. Just got to infinity in classic and it was worth it to get premium to have all the other content. Overall a good game"", 'This game is a really good game it touch my heart when I seen how much my sister love it she really looks forward to playing this game she always get happy when I say I want to have a battle on this game I love seeing how much feedback she gives the game I mean I just want to say whoever made this game thank you some much and we love you sooo much', ""This is hands down the best mobile game I've ever played, never got bored of it, I didn't buy premium btw, yet I finished the whole original mode The visuals and graphics, tracks and everything else is perfect. If some of yall didn't know there's also a mini game in the credits"", ""I love it when you out first play it is so nice. Then it gets better it's fast but slow and changing speeds and music constantly but it all relaxing. I love it."", ""I love this game I just think it's a bit unfair that every time you fail you go back to the very beginning. I was quite annoyed that when I got to stage six I died. Overall very good game I would definitely recommend getting this"", ""Five stars. Years and years ago I used to play this game on my dad's phone, so I installed it more for nostalgia than anything. The graphics are fascinating and keep you playing. I recommend downloading this."", ""It's a fun time killer that requires you to have quick reflexes. Give it a try and you will be surprised. I'm not interested in the premium so I cannot review the premium product, but the free play gives you only one path to take and I enjoy it just to burn a few minutes."", 'I used to play this game and tried to get better than brother and it posed a challenge even though I am very young it still gives me nostalgia and it is an amazing simple game also I feel a bit sad that I have pay 2 dollars to get the entire game and it is almost incompletable without 2 dollars because it is so challenging but it is very fun and I feel like it deserves these 5 stars because it is fun and simple', 'I highly recommend this game, it plays so smooth and the graphics and sound effects are amazing.

Nice graphics and well made scenarios although sometimes unexpectable Glass brake makes you Smash. Please allow people Zen mode or after checkpoint 11 Unlocking endless mode and accesing it for free. Other wise makes it useless to keep playing your game after reashing endless mode and less recomendable to friends. MAKE SOME PARTS FREE!!', 'While I find it annoying that you have to go through a whole paying process to unlock the use of checkpoints and alternative modes and would rather get minecraft pocket edition, the game modes are functional and fun to play. Four stars', 'This game is a great challenging game that will make you more intreagued to play it and get deeper into the game. It will also make you test your ability to pay attention to your surrounding and your speed. Over all this is a well thought out game with little to no ads.', 'Graphics are absolutely stunning for a mobile game. Gameplay is consistent, and immersive. It loses a star only because once you have beat the game... not much more to do. It does get monotonous over time. But a great time killer.', ""Me and my friend used to race on this game and I still play it today one of the best games on the app store I will say however there is that you start from the beginning when you lose which I'm fine with but if you can put the premium only for ads!!!"", 'I love it . This is very under rated game which should be way more popular.it has AMAZING Graphics and just so addictive .if I could ,I would rate it 10/10 stars .even though you have to pay for some of the additions I still love and really do recommend it.5/5 stars.', ""The game is ok, but I have to pay JUST TO PLAY A DIFFERENT MODE!😡💥🔥 Totaly a rip off. IF YOU make a sequal, make it were you don't have to pay for different mode."", ""Like game but hate that you have to purchase to continue to go to new checkpoints. As long as you don't lose all the balls you good which can be challenging but I like that. Just not the purchase part but there is no ad pop ups so almost a 5 star game."", ""I loved the gameplay, suer calming. But once you get farther, and lose, you can't reuse your checkpoints, you have to buy premium to use checkpoints and different gameplay, deleting right now."", ""strangley addicting... kind of annoying that you can't start from a checkpiont without paying for the full version... other than that I honestly love this game and don't know why"", ""I really like this game it is relaxing and it helps me calm down but the down side is when you have to hit the circles to open the door i have to throw quit a bit balls but other then that it's a very relaxing game. Hope this is helpful"", 'This app makes me calm and relax i love how you have to go through chapters and it speeds up.you have to be prepaired when it speeds up.its amiazing if you are reading this please check out the game and also no ads to deal with!']"
