I've looked at other Sudoku games as a new player / still learning / and came back to this one and paid the small fee to go ad free. Don't think I'll be looking for anything else! 😁😁😁"", 'The latest update has made it impossible to use, which is really disappointing since I was playing almost every day! For example, The pencil numbers are weirdly pixelated, and annoyingly don\'t always highlight when you choose a number (usually the number 9). Also, the hint button keeps hovering inane messages like ""tap here"" or something which are hard to get rid of and cover up the board. There are so many new bugs, I really hope the developers undo this update soon!!!', ""I was loving this app all the way until the latest update which made it so the number 9 wouldn't highlight the notes, which made it really annoying and hard to see. I had to download other Sudoku apps because of this update. Please fix this, this is my favorite Sudoku app if not for the new bugs!"", 'Too many ads Edit : the company responded to my review and advised to use the ""remove ads"" feature in the settings. Great suggestion, if it actually worked. Once you click on the remove ads option, the app just freezes. Great click bait! Company seems to be a scam for ads on a very basic app. DO NOT DOWNLOAD', ""Very happy with the app, but with just one problem - pencil mode doesn't let me pencil in numbers that are mistakes. I don't want the app telling me that a number isn't possible and then preventing me penciling it in, it should be up to _me_ to spot the error. It's a form of exploit that could never happen with actual pencil/paper. This should be an option that can be disabled."", 'For years, I had refused to solve sudokus using electronic devices. However, since my son encouraged me to use this app, knowing my passion for sudokus, I have discovered that this is the best way to play this fascinating game. Apart from being accessible, it is easy to use and have all the tools people need to track improvements.', 'So this was by far my favorite sudoku game, I didnt feel like it was overwhelming with ads and the game layout felt a lot better than other versions. However now they have ""updated"" the game and made it absolutely unplayable. It crashes after about 15 seconds of playing. I\'ve uninstalled and reinstalled the game and closed it several times. Still crashes as soon as you start playing. Very disappointing...', 'Nothing more infuriating, on a game, than to be forced to sit through a 30 second advert with no option of exiting or skipping. Uninstalled.', 'Time has run out. This had to be deleted. This is a substandard app, and there are better ones. Game timer keeps running, even when you\'re not in the app. Meaningless achievements. ""100 hints""? That\'s BAD thing, NOT an achievement. NON-ESCAPABLE Full volume ads ON, in MUTED game. CRITICAL: App prevents device from doze/sleep when paused or after winning = Battery drain. Can\'t exit game - can start New Game, or kill app.', ""Great game to pass the time. You get 3 mistakes before you have to watch an ad to continue on which I think is pretty reasonable. Required you to properly think and choose your numbers! It has different back ground colours to fit your preference and it's just an all round fun wee app of sudoku. 😊"", 'Wow. This app is so fluid. One can just fly through the easy puzzles. The screen is delicately drawn and rapidly updated. One stops paying attention to the actual app and more to the numbers and data. I believe by playing games fast like this your brain can recognize patterns quicker to learn them long term. This is outstanding.', ""Nice, hard puzzles, and a nice dark theme option, but the Jan 2020 update introduced an exploit that ruins it for me. It's not fun imo being informed where I placed compared to other players, anything less than 60th percentile feels like I lost. The exploit is using the ads to get unlimited hints, because the game is paused during ads, meaning I can easily finish in the 90th percentile every time, having absolutely no fun whatsoever."", 'The App is great but it came with a minor bug in the last version: the highlight feature for identifying the possibilities is not working for number 9', ""It's a very good app. I never get the same puzzles, and the difficulty levels are accurate. It does have ads. However, they're very short, leaving me just enough time to recharge; and I'm off to the next puzzle. I have absolutely nothing negative to say about this app."", 'When i make a mistake, it marks the number red right away and if i make 3 mistakes, it gives me a ""second chance"" to fix my mistakes (but i have to watch a video first!?! When will these people learn? I turn off the sound and avert my eyes for 15 seconds. How do ads ever work is beyond me???) But I don\'t want to know right away that i have made a mistake. Let me work on it so i can figure it out on my own. UNINSTALL', 'Was good till the last update, now nearly impossible to win without needing clues, that you have to watch ads to get. But the last straw was having to watch political ads. Will download a different ad, you should have known better than to sell political ad space.. to edit after your reply...I find it interesting your reply is to remoe the ads (ie pay for it) at least you are honest..you made the game impossible to play without constant ads, therefore we can pay to have what we had before for free..umm no thanks', ""Multiple times the game closes for no reason when you're half way through the game. Pretty aggravating. Looking for a better version of sudoku and then I'll uninstall this irritating version. I appreciated your response and knowing that you are aware of the issue. Do you send notices of updates, or will the app auto update from the store. I will keep using, just no longer do the daily challenges. My experience is that is where the app has an issue. Good luck with the fix. I do like the graphics. Also, please consider a version with the option of paying a small fee, say every six months to limit ads. Thank-you."", ""I would give this a higher rating if they gave the option on their settings to mute the ads. Having loud, noisy ads limits where I can use this app................. The quick reply below is impressive, thanks. I am not talking about removing ads altogether, which I know requires a paid subscription. I'm talking about something that other apps do: an option in the settings to mute all sound from the ads without having to turn down the volume control on your phone. The ads still play, but the loud music or whatever that goes with them doesn't suddenly come out of the phone. That's what keeps me from playing your game in public."", 'Edited review. Increased star rating because crashing stopped. I love this game and play every day but the colors on the game board need more contrast. As someone with vision problems, I must advocate for inclusivity. Update is terrible. Crashes for no reason and new UI makes it hard to see numbers. This used to be my favorite.', 'The game itself is great. My problem is with the ads blasting at full volume even when my phone is set to silent. This is a game I would like to play while sitting in a waiting room but the loud ads do not allow for this. If you can fix the LOUD ad issue i will gladly rate the app 5 stars.', 'I used to love this game and the daily challenges that were actually a challenge! Now the majority are easy after the update! I also hated the new color scheme when it came out, but did get used to it. Why did you ruin a good thing! I will need to find something new!', ""I like the app setting BUT i can not skip the ads I have another sudoku app that has less functions but I rather play that because I can skip ads I might even buy the other app just because it allowed me to skip the ads Ads spoils the fun for me 1* rating plus a negative rating because you can't skip the ads cya thank for trying"", ""Once you get the hang of it (it explains how to play at the start), it's really fairly straight-forward. A really good and engaging numerical and brain-teaser game to play for 30mins-1hr each day. Also perfect for those with competitive spirits, as there's a timer for each new game played. 4 levels (easy to expert), so very versatile and inclusive for all skill levels. There are settings which you can alter to your preferences. 100% recommend :)"", ""Great app for those starting to play Sudoku and then advancing to higher levels, as you can set them according to your comfort level with the game... However the stats shown after completing the game seems off. The paercentage of players you beat at solving the Sudoku don't seem to match up with the best time shown."", 'I enjoy sudoku, I play it all of the time. But the main reason I downloaded this app was because of an ad. The ad showed a game of sudoku 15x15! Sounds very difficult but I was intrigued. Sad to say, I cant find that mode anywhere on the app. Other than the clickbait on the ad, its a pretty good app.', 'The experience is great but the game has unsolvable Sudoku games. I chose an expert level Sudoku and felt as many boxes a Sudoku player can fill with \'logic\' but still, I hot stuck, its been hours and I cant find a solution for it... Sudoku shouldn\'t involve guess work or ""hints"" because its a logic game but this one is not the ONE', 'I use to play Sudoku, over 10-years ago, out of the newspapers: This is the first time that I\'ve ever played Sudoku on my phone, let alone online 😋... I love it! You guys have made this game more enjoyable: So, now I am interested in playing this game, again; because, of the features you\'ve added - ie. ""Timer"", ""Rankings"", etc.......................... >>> Well done, Creators & Developers.👍', 'I like the idea of having different levels of the game I am a beginner it so nice to be shown photo play Bloking out he numbers so you will not use it again is really great I think i am. going to like this game done t levels I am really to start bottom level. Done', ""I'm really liking this version of Sudoku! It's much more challenging than some I've played"", ""Latest update has reduced the sensitivity when selecting a number to the point of it being a problem. You can no longer play fast because of the difficulty in getting it to recognise which number you are selecting and having to then undo errors caused by this. Its causing at least an extra 20 seconds per game and any chance of now beating a fastest time is pretty much gone. It's taken the edge off what used to be an amazing 5 star game."", ""Very good puzzles. However, this update and reskin squishes the numbers together and makes it harder to tell everything apart. I assume the numbers were made larger to increase readability, but I prefer them small and would greatly appreciate the option to set it back to how it was before. It's also harder to hit the pause button and the highlights on a selected square go away when you lock a number. I do like the ability to tap and hold the number so you dont have to go back every cell though!"", 'I am very disappointed with the update. I liked the old colour scheme, and now, there\'s only a horrible yellow option that is a ""close"" match. Could you please give us the option of the old colour scheme again? The new color options are really hard on my eyes. The reason I use this app was because it wasn\'t hard on my eyes. If I wanted to strain my eyes, I would buy (or print my own) sudoku puzzles. I consider this game unplayable to me now. Very disappointed.', ""Was a great game until thos last update. I love to relax while doing Sodoku, it takes my mind from the daily stress. This last update introduced achievements, 1 of which has to do with hints used (pay or ad related revenue for the developer). I paid for no ads which gives me unlimited hints, but I don't Soduko with hints. They also introduced a global ranking by %, use hints, finish quicker, rank higher. This is stress and work induction, not reduction."", 'The latest update completely ruined the look and feel of the app to the point that I have to uninstall it after many months of use. Why change something that was working so well developers? The colour schemes are so lacking now. In pencil mode the used numbers no longer highlight in the number row, which was a very handy feature. Shame to lose such a good app! Devs seem to give generic responses to these reviews also so no hope of getting old version back, just a money grab with intrusive ads.', 'With this new color scheme, it is impossible to easily and quickly differentiate set numbers and those penciled in Penciled in numbers are now basically camouflaged. Playability has been ruined by this because it causes too much eye fatigue. I was playing probably fifteen puzzles and up per day. Now I have to read books or more likely stare at a wall to pass time.', 'Challenging play. Not the most colorful graphics, but graphics are not what Sudoku is about. The program works well, but the video ads use up a lot of battery power and they override the speaker-off which is not only annoying to me, but more so to others sitting nearby. Will look for another app more suitable.', 'I have a Samsung S6 and since the last round of updates my button lights come on and don\'t turn off until I close the app. Very annoying! Am also not sure how I feel about the introduction of finding out how my score compares to other people\'s (""you scored higher than 70% of people"")...nice idea but perhaps could be on a different page/tab of the game. I play to relax - not to beat times! Otherwise the app works well with very clear lettering and the ads only come on in between games.', ""Decent game, terrible interface. In number first mode, IT SHOULD NOT CHANGE THE CURRENT CELL WHEN A NEW NUMBER IS SELECTED. That's the whole point of NUMBER FIRST. Also, your Google Play listing should not show a style of puzzle you don't offer. That's false advertising. <<>>"", ""I downloaded this app after seeing (and clicking on) an ad featuring a 16 x 16 size puzzle, yet the actual app doesn't include this size puzzle, only the classic 9 x 9 puzzle. Pretty dang disappointed, I was looking forward to the challenge."", 'Great app ! I like the feature where you can keep track of your progress. P.S I wish the highlight will be designed only for the selected column and row, excluding the whole grid.']"

I had 5 consecutive puzzles that ended up with a few tiles in the bottom center of the puzzle, where two identical tiles were stacked on top of each other. The only way to solve these 5 puzzles was to watch a 30 second video so you could get a free shuffle. If you stop the video before it ends, ""Sorry, you failed."" So, you get full screen ads, AND you are forced to watch 30 second videos. Uninstalled.', 'I don\'t know how you can have 5-second ads on startup and then after every single game and still ask for a five star rating every so often. Graphics are great and while this is still a time-based, win-3-stars type mahjong (I\'m still looking for a decent one that isn\'t), it\'s one of the better ones. But my goodness, there isn\'t even an option to pay to remove ads even though you cannot move on to the next board without one. Give me a ""remove ads"" paywall and I will gladly rate this app 5 stars.', 'Overall good. I got bored with it once I realized the level generation is highly simplified. This ensures the levels are always soluble, but once you see the pattern, you will hardly ever fail a level. This is not true mahjong where the tiles are more randomly placed and you have to be strategic to reduce the chances of getting stuck. This is more of a speed matching game.', 'Occasional glitches with ads that either refuse to end, requiring a restart of the app, and the fact that some of the add are so much louder than the music background combine to drop a star, but not badly enough to drop the app. If these issues improve I will happily revise my review.', 'I play games like this to relax. Disruptive ads are already unavoidable in mobile games but do you have put shiny pulsating ads MIDGAME im trying to focus on all the fifferent shapes as it is but i cant because the bottom of my screen is flashing a gold download button and ads for other games. Found the game unplayable.', 'I enjoy the game and the ads are usually not that bothersome but the ads started popping up upon opening the app before the game even finished loading. 4 times in a row. If there was even a slight delay I would not mind viewing the ads but as the first thing I see when opening the app I am disgusted.', ""This app so great! It is an amazing, fun game suitable for all ages and not too hard that it makes you frustrated but hard enough to make you look properly. I love the various levels and the element sections and I especially love the pictures beside the names (I know that isnt really part of the gameplay but I'm not joking it's just beautiful!) The graphics, sounds, controls are all amazing! Great game, would definitely recommend!"", ""Fun & easier to play than the desktop version where you have to suss out the different heights a tile is stacked at. Haven't tried any options, if any. Asks me however to update via the app - would prefer the update to be checked via playstore. Would recommend for when waiting (like in a queue or at the hospital, etc ). Good game"", 'After playing two levels, a pop-up ""suggests"" I give a review of the game and gives an Exit (X) button, a ""Later"" button and a ""5Stars"" button.. however the (X) and the ""Later"" options were not responsive.

I LOVE CanaryDroid!!! btw, the tiles are a nice, easy-to-see size and the layouts are unique and fascinating. I'm *very* happy! THANK YOU. 😁"", ""Sleek visuals and lots of content. Ads are somewhat common but pretty short. They do not feel invasive at all. Edit: These ads for reshuffling are so obnoxious combined with the ads for opening the app + new levels. It's at the point where I would just pay to remove the ads. Still love the looks and feel, but I prefer to not be interruppted halfway through every other level."", ""This is by far 1 of my favorite games to play on a daily basis. I love playing this game. It's relaxing and really fun to play. And it helps to pass the time away. I play this game almost every day. I reccomend installing this game onto either your cellphone, your tablet, your laptop or your desktop. You may find this game a neat game to play on a regular basis."", ""My experience with playing the game was good 👌😊. I'm pretty much always wanting to go play with this game first before any of my other games now and I really like that my five year old daughter can play with me and actually better than me some times. No kidding 😂"", ""Fun!😁 I recommend this game. Mahjong can help improve a person's memory skills and sharpen the mind. It helps people to make faster decisions and better observations, and also forces players to think on different spectrums. Mahjong makes an excellent social activity and prevents isolation for people of all ages."", ""Time consuming but can you please chill out with the ads??? There are so many ads in this game it kinda makes me want to stop playing it. But besides the ads this game is very good and you aren't going to win all the time which is good and raging at the same time."", ""Mildly addicting. Once you get the hang of it, it g ors wuickly.

The only problem for some people is patience...The game is too teach you how to think in hard situations and learn how to spot differences quicker."", ""It's a great game, I just wished it didn't make you watch a video in order to shuffle, but that's ok, I can just repeat the level, no biggie. The adds between levels are annoyingly the same two, but it's good that you can skip. This app is all about patience!"", 'This is one of my favorite game. I challenge myself to see how fast I can match without mistakes I use my thumbs to match and also try using both, then one or the other one to help me focus. Love challenges great game.

It's too much and takes away from the overall enjoyment of the game."", ""Great fun! Tile formations change up each game which keeps the interest up. Ads are politely placed so you don't resent seeing them so much. Also, you get free shuffles to break a stalemate - for watching ads. Its a little hazy how the points/rewards earned work tho -anyway, it holds your interest."", 'Great game with only a few ads. I like it. I had this on my phone, actually still do, and just added the game to my tablet. I play it everyday.', ""challenging yet relaxing.

And when the game runs out of moves, you're forced to watch another ad just to continue!

It provides me with hours of pleasure.', 'Ive downloaded this two times thinking i could get the tiles in the advertisement. But no such luck. It is unfair of you to advertise like this.

I haven't had ANY problems with the game, with bugs, so far."", ""The games are easy, not timed but I wish the artwork on the tiles was sharper. I don't enjoy the bland tiles. They are very sloppy."", ""Liked it until it started blasting loud music with the in between ads. I have the sound and music turned off on the game but can't on the ads. Used to not be this way.

À tout à l’heure! See you soon!","[""I have won up to $11.25 so far and I haven't cashed it out so I don't know about that part. The game is really fun and I really enjoy playing it. But I also have some complaints and I've already contacted help sp, for instance clearing a board and it freezing up on me after I used all my gold bars to buy bombs to help me win the round. The only option at that point is to leave the map and usually when that happens you automatically lose, but they made it right and give me my gold bars back."", ""The ads are ways to long which has made me not want to play. I have never waited for ads like this. And at one point I spin and it said I won a $1000 so download Google pay i did, it never went on there 😡 really upsetting. And what about this piggy bank, I haven't won anything in it and I'm at level 16, am I suppose to put $7 in it first?"", 'This game has 92 levels. You can ""Cash Out"" at $7. I completed the 92 levels & didn\'t get a cent past $6.75, THE WHOLE GAME. I like the game itself, so I decided to play again. I\'m on level 70 & NOT 1 CENT in these 70 levels. My point, if you\'re looking to make pocket money like I was, YOU DO NOT WANT THIS APP!!!', ""Never win any cash....At first I did. I Reached $6.75 right away. Its been 4-5 months since Ive won even a nickel! I've beaten the Tiki Challenge 2x now and only won a few coins. Not even 50¢ was given.. Very disappointing. I still play every day because I like the challenge of it. I won absolutely zero. You have to reach $7 before you can get the piggy bank? No wonder it quit paying once I earned $6.75 Fun but very misleading . Your response was lame to someone who has played a few months now"", 'I will change my rating when you change and stop lying. It is false advertising. This app does not work. You have to have 7.00 to cash out. The first 3 days I got to 6.75. Been playing for two weeks. Their is a bad after every level and a scratch off after every level. I have watched 500 ads, scratched 500 scratch offs and can not get that last .25 cents. Will play for one more week if they dont quit cheating I will delete this game and call the better business bureau.', 'This game is fun and addicting. Also i only played for a little over a week before my first paypal cash out. I have not experienced any glitches or bugs. Which is rare for me with most games with ads.. Thanks for the game, guys! We need more games like this! I have tried a LOT of scratch of and money making games before this one and i have never been able to actually cash out until now. Keep up the good work! This game definitely deserves a 5 star rating!', 'The puzzles are fun but the game stops after 95 levels. Ads are so long my screen times out! Bugs were fixed with update, but my offer disappeared. I completed an offer (played a game) for 330,000 coins that took 2 months to get to the specified level. Did not get the coins and now the offer is gone. Support will not give me the coins until the offer reappears and can validate I played the game.', ""In order to cash out PayPal you need $7 well I've been $6.75 forever and I'm on the last stage of the game. Which is 95. The app drops continuously. This isnt one that once your close to being able to collect that's as far as you'll get. I'm updating my previous review. I'm now almost level 70 on a second go round and still at 6.75 apparently they dont want to give that quarter i need for them to cough up $7 to me."", ""**UPDATE: I ended up uninstalling this app bc of all the ads. I can't stand trying to get involved in a game & an ad popping up after each level or pressing ok & an ad; or pressing accept & an ad. Annoying as hell. *Initial review~ Pretty cool, thought it'd be offering a bit more money. But some cash is better than none. :)"", ""Fun and actual $$ - been playing 3 days and just cashed out for $7. It will run out of levels but does say more adventures coming plus you can play the Tiki challenge 2 times a week if you run out of levels. Additionally they have scratch cards and Quests to earn more cards. It's been fun so far and love the extra in my PayPal account."", ""A lot of ads. You never ever win money, maybe $1 once a month. I would give it 5 stars if the app wasn't so deceptive and allow you to actually win REAL money at least 1/3 of the time or just do away with the lie altogether. That's the only thing that irritates me. THE FARCE OF IT ALL! Don't waste your time! EDIT: GAME KEEPS STARTING OVER TO LEVEL 1. YOU'LL NEVER WIN REAL MONEY! $7 ONCE!"", 'I am not getting the boosters very often anymore. I get the regular boosters but 9 out of 10 times all l get is a few coins or a few free minutes to play!! Things have changed dirasticly.........not fun any longer!!! On Tiki challenge you don\'t offer boosters at the beginning of each level like you do in the game. What\'s luck got to do with getting boosters?? If that\'s so I must be the most unlucky person ever!! ""Come on, you don\'t go from loving the game to not having fun if nothing changes!', ""So far it's pretty good. Decent time killer, I like matching games, and I just cashed out $8.50 which I didn't know I could do because I presumed I had to get at least $10 like all the other games. Yes, there are ads, no, you don't get tons of money... And as long as you understand that it fills the time while you have to wait around RL."", ""This is one of my favorite apps. I've started over several times and have cashed out a few too. I've gotten $32 in total and some other PayPal credits and Amazon gift cards so far. It's a go to when I'm bored just because it gets challenging in the higher levels and I like some of the matching games out there anyhow so why not earn gift cards while I'm at it. :p"", ""My response to their response: The only time luck was involved was with the piggy bank. Other than that it depended on how much you played and collected coins. 270k coins meant $25 guaranteed... Oh man I used to love this game. But now it's a sweepstakes instead of collecting coins to cash out you collect entries...Bring back the old way because sweeps sucks. I used to have this at 5 stars and as my favorite real paying game... now I barely want to play it."", ""Well I beat every level available and guess what? Of course it stopped giving cash right before you get to 7 dollars but they will make a ton in the countless adds you will watch trying to get that last quarter. Don't worry though it lets you start over from level one and gives you nothing but a few more adds to line their pockets with. Very well made scam is the best I can say at the moment."", ""Been playing this game for over a month and gone through the whole board 5 times and have been stuck at $6.75 since I finished the board the first time, and no matter how many tickets I rack up I don't win any sweepstakes, I think these sweepstakes winners are faked or rigged for certain people to win in order to keep people hoping, if I don't make it to at least $7.00 by the end of the month I'm giving up on this app and other apps like it"", 'This game is a total scam!!! Borderline false advertising and if I could rate it a zero, I would!!! It is Extremely difficult to win cash! It is a time waster and the developers ought to be ashamed of themselves! As a matter of fact, this game can go into the junk pile along with the other lying and trifling games that claim to win cash! One more thing, the ads are a bit much!!!! I rarely rate games a one star but this one deserves it, actually a -1!! \U0001f92c\U0001f92c\U0001f92f', ""The game itself i love playing. I passed there 100 level game twice and on my 3rd one. But, one time i purchased a $6.99 weapons and gold bars, I didnt receive it due to there game freezing up (this happens quite often). So, i made a request to there customer service dept for a refund or the weapons I purchased for, no response for few days and when they finally did I receive 50 gold bars. Where's the rest of my purchase package. I must have spent over $100 with you guys. Terrible service."", ""So this game is supposed to let you win cash, but you have to have at least $7.00 to cash out. Wow you say, I've played about half the levels and I'm at $6.75! Unfortunately you'll never actually get that last $0.25 to cash out, even completing all the levels and keep playing for another 1/3 of the levels. Nope, still at $6.75. It's a decently fun game to pass time, but don't count on actually getting any cash."", ""Not sure what to make of it yet. Haven't gotten to the $7 min for payout even. Seems like another pay to get paid game so far. I've only been playing for 1 week. Just a match 3 type. Never win event levels unless I use power up so again, pay to get paid. If you have unlimited time on your hands an can play the same game over and over again then seems like you might make enough to get a number 2 at McDonald's."", 'Awesome game!! Lost my last account but i have done the 95 levels 6 to 7 plus times over and won enough money to keep me addicted!!! Ive had technical issues on occasion and each time has been fixed on a timely manner!! Just having hard time getting to last rebiew and accidently gave 1 star when i meant 5!! Download this game , you wont be disapointed', 'LOVE IT! I actually was paid. Ive been playing for a little while now and dont play all the time but i was able to try both cashout options and they both worked exactly as stated in game. Yes you can actually hit real cash on the scratch cards, not big amounts most times but it was nice hitting some and cashing the piggy out! Thank you so much for an awesome app!', ""Level 70 and still stuck on $6.75. At the beginning of the game they're generous in giving out $.25 rewards but when you're almost at the point of cashing out... nothing. I don't think they will ever reward me the $7 no matter how far along on the levels I get. The game is entertaining but their promise of cash out is not."", ""Hard to win real money. You win tickets for drawings that you never win. Way too many ads and ads are too long. As you play more levels tthey become too hard to beat and every lost level results in a long ad afterwards. You have to play some levels 50 times to beat so that's 50 long ads. Uninstalling this time waster. It isn't even fun to play anymore. Would give zero stars if I could."", ""My problem with this game is that I was to level 94 and suddenly it just erased all my progress and reset me to level one. I tried using my Facebook account to recover and it said there is nothing to recover. There are times it doesn't finish out moves before it says your out of moves when it's obvious that it was going to clear the board on the last move. There are times when it will not respond to the move I want and have to make a completely different move. There are other things as well"", 'Its true that i have reached 6.75 on a few levels ago and cant seem to get any more money. So perhaps wont truly pay out but i still enjoy playing this so i will continue. If you are only playing games to earn money then you will never have fun so find the ones that are fun for you and if you happen to earn enough to cash out then great and if not...well at least you had fun!', 'I have tried many of the games that claim to pay you. Some are legit but require a lot of time and memory to dowload other apps. Many are not legitamate at all. In my opinion this is by far the best and most legitimate one i have tried. I just cashed out the $7.00 for the third time and i have also cashed out coins for giftcards multiple times. All this ftom playing one game that i enjoy for a short time each day.', ""So far I'm not impressed. On the scratch off tickets I haven't received some of the things I won. The game hangs up every now and then. I'll change my rating if I receive a satisfactory solution to the problems I've submitted to the support staff. I like the game I just hope that they fix the issues!"", ""This game is fun! That's just what it is,just to play to pass the time by it let's u get just about to the cash out amount of 7dollars and and it will just continue to give u tickets on the scratchers then I have beat all the boards twice over and the say new games will be coming soon but when?? Bull#%#^#."", ""So far I haven't won money but I really like the game it keeps you on the edge of my seat and so much fun to play and I got a chance to win real 💰 that would be great because I really need the money and having a lot of fun trying to win 💰 defenley a 👍 from me! That's the best reveue I ever gave on any the games I played to this date ! Thank you. Great game! I will tell everyone that I can to play this Allsome game and you can win real cash , enjoy your self at the same time I gave a five *"", ""Love the challenging levels and ease if gameplay. Its been a little slower on reaching a payout level for me than some people have reported, but I play mostly for distraction. There's a good variety of tasks to be completed to reach the scratch cards, but having the hourly card really helps get through some of the harder levels."", 'Ok game play, however you replay levels after one time through, beyond that you are more likely to get VD from the Virgin Mary than actually coming close to getting paid cash of any type for playing this game. So unless you enjoy throwing money and/or time away, probably best to steer clear of this blackhole.', ""I used to play similar games in the past to help pass the time. This game is fun and it gets more challenging as u progress to higher levels. The fact that u genuinely get rewarded for yr game play is a great way to keep u interested. The most legit game with real rewards that I've played. I think I downloaded the game in November. Since then I've cashed out the earned cash for 7.00 and 7.25. I've also cashed out my coins once for 10.00. I'm currently nearing cashing out coins for 50.00"", 'Your algorithm is predictable because of the ads that makes you\'all $$ Give us a chance to share, just a bit more in the your profits. You would have more ""shares"" if you would rewrite your code to allow us players a better opportunitie to win just a bit more... I can say more but, I know you know, exactly what I mean. Share your wealth and I\'m sure you\'re income and popularity will increase. But..... Of course, you all feel u are coding enough for your pockets now. Just a comment. ~peace~', ""Updated my Review Hey everyone this is by far the best app that pays you real Cash! Right into your PayPal account! For me I've cashed out at least 3 times already! Check it out for yourself! It's not often I find myself trying these kind of games often. Normally these genre games I find a bit time-consuming before any real payout. But this game surprisingly is fun and actually it builds up the credit by quickly"", 'Although I NEVER bother rating these type of apps I RELUCTANT decided to rate this one. Of course i never expected to win any type of real money by downloading the app and playing the game (DAILY) it would be a better app if they didnt allow you to get 25 cents away from being able to cash out and then BLATANTLY not ever allow you to win another 25 cents!!!!!!! I am changing my rating and doubling down on my previous post!!', ""The first few days it throws money at you, but after that all it does is give you ticket after ticket. All the scratch offs you get will never allow you to reach $10. I've had this app for 3 months and gone and completed the board completely at least half a dozen times. Still not even a meager $10!!! TOTAL APP FAIL"", 'Fun scratchers. But there are too many off shoot games drawing me away from original game. (Not fun). Try keeping it down. It will be more fun for the player. Gamer will have more fun and possibly play longer. No one likes that many interruptions during the game "" they"" decided to play.', ""The game is fun but shouldn't claim to give money out, you watch hundreds of adds, payout is at $7 This is my second install on different phone like someone else stated the money stops at $6.75 oh so close and the first time I cleared 37 levels imagine how many adds I watched someone's sitting in Malibu drinking margaritas.""]"

I'd like the levels to be a bit more challenging, but sometimes I like having a game that doesn't take me days to beat a level. However, I hate the SandCity part of the game. I have no desire to spend gems on placing little decorations around. I did a couple, hoping it would unlock new things, but it doesn't. I really hate being forced to visit it after a level in this update, I just closed the game."", ""Fun game, but definitely need more goals! New cities to build would be nice? Playing to collect gems and cars at this point, and for what?? Also, far too many ads from the get go.. I paid the $3 to eliminate them, only to find out I would deadlock with no more goals?! Lower the price of VIP!! Are you crazy? $6 a month MAYBE, but a week?! That's $24 a month, for a game with no purpose, no updated goals, and no difference in how challenging it gets.. Good luck! I'll buy a game at the store thanks!"", ""Good overall. Bit buggy sometimes the giant balls don't pop, or a small ball goes through a seemingly solid wall, which is really annoying. Definitely not worth VIP though. Ad free is worth it. Would be helpful if you had the option to spend diamond on car upgrade if ad fails. I have had the advert fail multiple times and you have zero option to get the car then."", 'I have upgraded my rating to five stars. With all the upgrades I am very pleased.

But if one doesn't come alone soon, I'll be uninstalling. Shame because I've loved playing this game and was looking forward to some new and much awaited content."", ""This game is entirely pointless, yet a fun way to kill time and quite addictive. Unfortunately, it's been unplayable (read: laggy and choppy) since the last update. Once that's fixed, however, I'm going to update my score."", ""At best, 3 stars. It's very basic but I give props for the correct way to use ads. However, don't suddenly change the game and force VIP purchases if you wish to continue playing the basic game in the manner you had been playing."", 'I really enjoyed this game until the update. The ridiculous lag makes it frustrating. Also, the insane amount of ads makes me want to quit playing it.

I even paid for no ads, but I still get ads all the time. It asks me after every level of I want to watch an ad for some bonus, and I have to wait for the ""no thanks"" option to appear! Even if I want to replay a level, I have to watch an ad! What the hell did I pay for if I can\'t play the game without ads?!', ""It's good, starting off is when it asked me for personalized ads, saying I had to be 16+ to agree, (which I'm not and I don't want them anyway) It didn't give me the option to say no. Sometimes it will ask me to try a VIP effect, (same one every time) and it won't let me say no to that either. And it could ask me to try a different VIP effect once in a while. Then with Sand City, I think all the structures and decorations are too close together, hard to see, and some things are poorly animated."", ""I actually really enjoyed this game,would be 5 stars, but the ads are just insane...1 every level mandatory 30 seconds long!! It was enough to make me uninstall cause I just got sick of them. Shame you ruined a great game with your greedy ads!☹😡 Tried it again a few months later, so far I've only hit 1 ad...much improved, thanks!! If it stays this way, I'll increase to 5 STARS! Great game, enjoy the sound effects too!"", ""Great game except there are ads after finishing literally every level. I get they need the ads to get some type of pay for their app and you can pay to remove the ads (I believe it was around 4$). But having this many is unreasonable especially with it being such a popular game. I'll probably end up uninstalling after a week due to the ads. Only so much product placement a person can take."", 'Addicting! I loved this game at first, but the last ""upgrade"" has made it annoying! Now you have to go to Sand City about everytime following a level. And it is super slow! I\'m uninstalling!', ""The game play is decent, but the ads... Good God the ads... Want to scroll and see the whole level? Buy VIP. Want the new car or ball? Watch an ad. Oh, you just finished a level? Here, have an ad. Don't want ads? Buy VIP. I really tried to see if it was worth paying, but I've seen so many ads that I never want to see the game again, much less pay for it."", ""Startled me awake at 4 am with a notification 🙄 I dont need to be reminded to play a game. It's also incredibly easy. If you just want something to do and turn off notifications, its a fine game."", ""They are only about money. I actually like the game play. It's repetitive, but I enjoy it. I paid to have no ads, but the game is all about money. Everything centers around you watching ads. The 'treasure' chest round where you get a free ball makes it seem you have a chance without an ad. But I've opened 100 or so and never got a ball without an ad. Their VIP service which they shove in your face daily coster per week! For a phone game! Give me a break. Have a fun game with a decent buy in..."", ""Really fun game but I'm considering deleting because of all the ads. Its seems to have an excessive amount."", ""I have never had to uninstall a game because of ads before. But this feels like such a money grab. They want you to watch ads constantly. Plus there's a little one in the middle of your game. Then they want you to pay for an upgrade to VIP and watch an ad to get the truck that you won. It's just nonstop. I have never seen so many prompts for ads or payments in a game. It just started to feel like that was the only purpose this app was created. 30 second ad for 5 seconds of play."", ""Nice Time Killer But Gets Repetitive. Once you have all the Beach upgrades unlocked and your vehicle is upgraded to a reasonable percentage, it just gets to a stage where there isn't really anything to do. The levels are easy and don't take much skill/concentration to complete and even though you can get new balls and such, there just isn't enough content at times. If there were to be frequent updates that included some new, entertaining content, I would happily up my stars!"", ""I have been playing this game for about a month now and have all of the things built on the level.

Now I can't advance any further and the games are just redundant, the same ones over and over again without any other incentives. ...and it's been that way for over a hundred levels. Not worth playing anymore, and I'm not going to purchase a VIP package. Totally uninstalling now!"", ""This game has so much potential!! The levels get very boring very quickly as it doesn't get harder, and i know its a free game and adds need to happen but an add between every screen is going to far. Most levels take less than 30seconds to complete, iv just done 100 levels, and watched over 100 adds!!! That is why I am giving this game 2stars!!! And what a joke at $31.00 a month!!!! Ffs come on game makers. Uninstalling at over 500 levels....sadly"", ""Fun but it rarely loads properly. I have perfect wifi signal and yet it doesn't want to load videos to get keys (lost out on that about 10 times) and it doesn't want to give me the cars I've earned. I've missed out on 3 cars. It's very disappointing. On top of that I really don't feel like watching political ads while I'm trying to relax and play a game. Keep your politics to yourself! I'm uninstalling this game."", ""The game's fine, ads are too intrusive. I get the idea that ads support, but the 30 second ones are a step too far."", 'Ads embedded DURING GAMEPLAY. This is a new low for mobile games. Sure there are banner ads at the bottom at all times. Sure there are ads that play between rounds. But now? Now, there will be small ads playing ON THE MAIN SCREEN WHERE YOU PLAY WHILE YOU PLAY. Absolutely disgusting. How in the world is this game rated above 2 stars. Immediately uninstalled.', ""Extremely laggy and unplayable whenever I'm connected to the internet or mobile data, also the side scroller is very obtrusive (please get rid of it or make it smaller if we don't have premium... Please...) When disconnected from any internet then the game plays a lot better and you don't get full screen ads that have no exit button, you have to miss out on any prizes you get for passing levels however. Good time waster if you don't have any mobile signal."", 'The mechanics to this are simple, swipe your finger to make a path to the car below. There\'s no timer, no limitation to how much you can dig, and hazards are easily avoidable (they have a digable barrier around them). So what is the point? For Say Games to get your money... There are plenty of ads, which you\'ll watch after each stage unless you go VIP. Which you won\'t because that\'s $5.99/week or $99/year. Seriously, they think it\'s worth it more than an AAA title. As Obiwon said, ""Move along.""', 'Addicting game, for sure! Paying a lot of money for a ""no-add"" game is worthless. You still have to watch ads to get certain things and even some level ups or extra diamonds. Maybe a one and done payment ... then it would be worth it. A reoccurring weekly payment to play this game is not worth it. Also, I\'m over 1000 levels with 225K+ in diamonds and I have nothing left to spend it on. There was supposed to be a new city ""coming soon"" but certainly not soon enough.', 'Very relaxing game. Its satisfying to do and is a great time killer. Only concern is with the side game, where, with your gems you can build up a beach and amusement park and buy extras to populate the field. It takes way too long to advance. This potentially could be a great part of the game and thus far is my only complaint.', 'If only there wasnt an ad every two minutes... The game is very fun, but after 300+ levels, the difficulty has not increased, which makes the levels a bit boring. Sand city is cute but after you upgrade everything and collect all balls, there is bothing left to spend currency on. Make less ads and update more frequently. Clearly the developers only want your money and dont actually care about this project.', ""Really good. Have some complaints. 1) too many ads. 2) doesn't seem to get harder through the levels. 3) the part you get to build on the game gets built up way too fast. I downloaded this game 24 hours ago. And have already reached level 255. Very awesome game!! But I feel like it should be alittle more challenging as you go forward. Tighter corners. Or something. And the ads are very annoying. 1-2 ads after every game. But like I said. The game is very fun to play! Very addicting."", 'Fun game, annoying ""VIP"" ads. After every level there is an ad that automatically plays, though you can skip it. The worst part is that at the same intervals they offer the ""VIP"" package, which is something like $5.99 a week or $99.99 a year which is laughable for a mobile game, especially of this caliber. The game itself is fun and addictive though. I\'m just flabbergasted they consider it to be worth $100/year, minimum.', ""I paid for the app to avoid constant ads, but not for their VIP (monthly subscription). After level 100, the scroller game feature becomes VIP-only. It's satisfying enough to play if you just want the levels to dig through the sand, and don't care about the rest of the game. Edited Conclusion: I finished getting everything by level 600 and uninstalled after level 852 when I had thousands of now worthless gems (in-game currency). Never paid for VIP."", 'I like this game, in spite of a couple of things. The building area ""Sand City"", is a cute and fun touch of City builder. I\'ve gone as far as currently available, without picking up the premium version of the app, but there\'s a section that says ""Coming Soon"". How soon? I\'m up to nearly half a million gems, and the level three cars, with no indication there\'s ever going to be an expansion. As to the premium version of the game, that\'s never going to happen. The price is prohibitive (continued)', 'I love this game its so addictive. But the last update yesterday is so bad. The game became laggy and unplayable. I will wait for update. Plus It lost the shaking movement why?', ""Game is fun and addicting. Great way to kill some time. You have the ability to earn gems to pay for new and different balls. That's it. There are really no incentives to playing. Once you have earned all the balls, theres nothing else. You cannot select between the different vehicles you earned either...."", ""You want people to $19.99 a month or $99.99 a year. And yet you can't get this app to work like it should!! I wouldn't pay you anything to to upgrade. You need to shut this down and fix this game you go though 4 to 5 stages and you get kicked off? No your game isn't worth $0.01 a month or $0.02 a year get your head out of your ass and fix your dame app"", 'Not sure what to do once you unlock everything and max out the attractions. Unlocked all the balls, have 30k diamonds and nothing to spend it on. Profile is only level 6, and I have nothing to build. Good game to kill time, ads after every level though so only 4 stars. Now through 350 levels, still level 6, 180k diamonds. Starting to repeat cars, I only play a few levels daily, and that seems repetitive now. Lowering rating.']"

Let’s play","[""Fun game but cheats after level 200 (If I remember correctly). Shoot a ball that matches the colour (more than 3) and it doesn't get rid of them like it should. Mostly on the boss levels, shot a ball at the first row and it might make it to the second or third row if any. Always seems to happen when you are getting closer to beating the boss. Use the multiple exploding icon, freezing the frog. Spent 10 diamonds/ watched 2 ads for nothing. Might uninstall game due to the frustration of it cheats"", 'Too many ads.

Some ads will hang in the loading stage until you are forced to quit and reload the game. There are also 2 power ups in the game that freeze the shooter like 85% of the time and the only way out is to reset the level. That wouldn\'t be so much a problem if you didn\'t get an ad nearly every time you reset/finish a level, and 2 out of 4 times that ad will freeze in loading', 'Always been one of Mr favorite games. Updating my review. The ads are very annoying!! Now they all hide everything the bottom of the game where the pause button is. If you hit the x to remove the ad, iit says ad was closed by google. Then it ask if you would like to report this ad. You hit on report, and you have 4 options with some and 3 options with others. If you chose the option that says ad is covering content, it says thanks ad closed by google. But they all hide content. Nothing changed.', 'Easy to play. Really enjoyable at 1st. But i realised it become harder to click doesnt respond well. Lagging is it? Hv to wait few seconds to shoot many times. That sucks. At times the game went crazy like the balls sunddenly merged or just disappeared. But.. Why is it so hard to shoot immediately.. Urghh', 'This game has my heart..I used to have a similar game on my pc when i was small and when i grew up i played so many games of thos name but none was so amazing.

As a Tetris game, it's still bare bones. But what people aren't seeing here is that this is the framework of a possibly very nice, feature rich take on Tetris. In its current state, yeah, you can play it. You can have fun with it. Might not quite be as enjoyable as say, Gameboy Tetris because of the lack of physical buttons for control, but swiping and tapping works just fine for a quick, casual game while you sit on the bus or something to that effect."", ""Not as good as it could be. I played EA's version for probably over 200 total hours. I had a highscore just short of 3 million in their endless mode. And in truth, this game is lacking important features that made that one as successful as it was. Endless mode and autosave of games being the most noticable absences. I hope these things will be added on. I really like the styles of the different themes. All in all, they did a pretty good job and I look forward to what they may add to improve it"", ""I had some pretty good scores on the ea version, and when I heard that it was getting shut down I found this. So what do I like? Well the visuals are great, and beyond that there isnt really much I prefer in this version rather than ea. The controls are ok at best, my biggest complaint is the unresponsiveness of hard drop I have to swipe twice on the board to get it to hard drop making the whole experience slow and sluggish. Just fix this and you've got a good game on your hand."", ""It's okay, it's tetris. Plays like tetris, looks like tetris trying to be modern, sounds like tetris trying to be modern. The only issue I had was after a round I had to put in a name for the leader board and it wouldn't let me use ANY names. Everything was apparently taken, even random button mashing wouldn't work. And you can't back out so you have to physically close the game from the device manager to get out of it and restart. Not gonna be playing often if that's the only way to end levels"", ""CAN BARELY SEE; BUT STILL GREAT. The new design is very cool and fresh looking but it's hard to see the minos. Especially the ghost piece is very hard to see if I'm not in high backlight. But I'm very very glad tetris didn't go away. This is the best time killer game ever"", ""The controls are nice and the gameplay is solid and smooth with a simplistic design. But the game is also pretty bland, because it doesn't give you any motive to play, and the only thing for you to earn up to is your personal high score"", 'About as solid as a mobile modern tetris game can get. The controls are as intuitive as possible for a touchscreen, and any difficulties with them is simply the medium. I think Tetris made a smart move by switching over from EA to independent developers like N3TWORK. They have made a much better Tetris game.', ""The music is terrible compared to the EA the Version. The controls were finicky even with the sensitivity controls adjusted. I liked the 8 bit mode but the new music was terrible and didn't mesh. The 3d effects make you dizzy after about 5-15 minutes."", ""The game controls could be much smoother, dragging a tetris block downwards sometimes changes it's direction too. Sometimes it's a struggle to drag the blocks across the screen. The updates have been promising though."", ""Finally a Tertris game that doesn't some super power up,weird game mode.but the control is kinda weird,because it does not use game pad or something like that but you drag and tap on the piece.but other than that, the game is great"", 'Bad control... i use to do in average 2000000 pts at ea. The quick drop down in unpredictable. The left righ is hard to do. There is no infinite mode or no choose to level you want. I usualy start level 16. It s not good. 0/10', ""It's really good and looks very nice, it just needs google play services integration to see leaderboards and maybe add some achievements to make it even better. Also adding a new control scheme would be nice."", 'While this is a good game, the controls feel off, and misread inputs pretty easily (though I may just need to adjust my settings.) Other than that, I just hope more game modes get added!', ""Bruh, I'm a hardcore Tetris fan, this game is far from Tetris! It's bad! First time trying to play was hard and confusing! Far cry from EA's version. Not fun when your just pulling blocks down."", 'Used to love the original; but this is an eyesore. My eyes literally hurt after playing this uninspired game; which brings nothing new or exciting to esports or competitive gaming.', ""I like how the game is but can whoever's add more looks to the game and some challenges I was thinking for a challenge as: Get 10 Tetris in one game: and the reward be the look of galaga sense this is a classical game"", ""The controls can be a bit slippery. But overall this is a much better alternative to EA's Tetris. Also I wish there were more theme options."", ""The game is fun only because it's Tetris. The EA Tetris will always hold a special place in my heart, that's the real 5 star tetris"", 'Its okay but nothing special. I miss one touch support and more gamemodes. The movile tetris scene could use some more intuitive controls anyway.', ""They did a lot right, but there's absolutely room for improvement. Most importantly, the play area is too small. Secondly, the preview tetrino blends in with the background so well that it can be difficult to determine exactly how it will fit into the placed tetrinos. All in all, I'm glad someone took over the Tetris legacy from EA as they obviously didn't care to put any time or resources into its development. Hopefully this new dev will give Tetris the attention it deserves!"", ""an eyesore. way too small on my phone to see easily and no way to change it. all of the available themes are too busy and have unnecessary sfx (which again can't be turned off). I love tetris but the graphics make this app unplayable. is it too much to ask for one minimalist theme with a style that actually looks like the tetris logo? the only good thing I can say about it is the gameplay is smoother than previous versions (and I appreciate the lack of in-game banner ads)."", ""Really enjoyed the EA version, and got really good at it. Since moving over to this one, I've noticed that my eyes hurt significantly after trying to distinguish what's going on on the screen after just one game. Also, it feels like the time between things sitting still and locking is slightly shorter, which I found strange. The lack of starting level selection is also strange for Tetris. Not all that much impressed, unfortunately."", 'The WiFi Issue is Fixed...Really liked it but the Game feels So Empty...it Needs more Gamemodes like Marathon , Arcade , Classic Tetris Gamemodes... PvP Even... So Yeah add more Gamemodes!', ""Not the best. I really like the idea of continuing the legacy of mobile Tetris, but the controls seem unresponsive, and it's difficult to progress. It's slow, and in my opinion, the game window is too small and I have to strain my eyes to see properly. I'd like to be involved with this project. Is there any way to apply for testing or development?"", ""It's hard not to compare this to the App it's replacing EA's Tetris. I'm sure more features will come in time but for it's a bit lacking compared to it's predecessor. Aside from there only being one game mode, the lack of a save or level select function really make the game difficult to enjoy. I do like the extra theming options though."", 'Really cool version of Tetris, but it sadly lacks a lot of other functions. Modes like Sprint, and maybe an additional battle mode. The themes are very well done, and are very fun. However this is more than likely the Tetris with the least functionality. Even the original NES Tetris had a sprint mode, and a level selector, which this game absolutely lacks. I hope this game gets changed soon, I love this game very much, but it lacks a lot. The controls are also a bit wonky too.', ""It's ok. The controls suck. It's is really aggravating to lose because the phone doesn't register a tap or swipe. It constantly does that. There is also no traditional colors. The best one is black and white...ish and it goes to color when you get a Tetris, but only for a couple seconds, there should be a plain color one."", 'The game looks good and is a neat way to pass the time. However, I wish there was more to do besides the standard marathon mode. The controls are ok; I got used to them eventually. Really, my only issue with this game is that sometimes when I try to do a t-spin, the tetromino locks in place a litte faster than I can rotate it. Would be neat if an online leaderboard was added. Otherwise, its a great way to play Tetris on mobile.', ""This is a good game overall, but I'd like to point out to some issues that seriously affected my gameplay. 1. The flashing colors when you make a Back-to-Back, in the 8-Bit visual theme, it's so distracting and a really bad design choice. 2. The pieces stick too quickly. 3. You can't close the game to continue your game afterwards. It just makes you start over and it's so frustrating. 4. I'd love to connect to my Facebook or Google account to keep my scores in case I move to another phone."", ""I can see myself playing this version of Tetris for hours as I try to get the best score possible. However, as the game is now, I can't really get into it. The gestures controls may work for some, but i find them to be pretty bad for this type of game. There needs to be on screen buttons to manipulate the blocks. Left, right, rotate left, rotate right, slow drop, instant drop. Adding gamepad support would be great as well. I'm giving it 3 stars for the lack of modes, and control options."", ""Have played Tetris since release. So glad to continue to support the game, especially if EA is no longer in the picture. Controls could stand to be a bit more responsive at higher levels. Playing field needs to sit higher on the screen and should be enlarged. Why is it so small? Cute backgrounds, need more customization options. I paid for the app after playing for a couple days. Worth the five bucks. Hope it's fine-tuned."", ""Built an app that just plays Tetris and I mean that in the best possible way. Launch app, click button, boom: TETRIS! It would be great to have a few more side options to tailor the TETRIS experience: initial level choice; toggle on/off Hold feature; adjust 'Stick' time (time it takes for a colliding tet to glue in place); toggle 3D/depth style for themes; full color version of the 8bits theme; arcade style hi-score screen (Name input after every game for top 10). I'd support again with those!"", ""Based off the merits of this version alone, it's a passable version with mediocre controls (at least they work as well as I predicted)... Compared to past versions; oy vey, I'm just glad I own a Switch, PS4, and PC since touch controls are still objectively the worst way to play Tetris. If you NEED your Tetris fix and can't use the aforementioned; then sure, give this a whirl. Hopefully you enjoy it more than I did. Just keep your expectaions in check."", ""I'm honestly surprised how even EA was able to make a better version of Tetris for phones. This game has nothing in it other than the original Tetris gameplay with a selection of 5 themes and no selectable difficulty level to start with. This version is more aesthetically pleasing, than EA's but this version plays like trash even after changing the touch sensitivity, the game doesn't react properly to what I am doing, also Tetris is a game that doesn't need vibration, just makes the game lag."", ""Could use some improvements, it's as functional as how you'd imagine a Tetris have, a standard marathon. Though they need to work on the touch control to be more comfortable to play with, as with higher levels the piece starts to lock faster before you can make meaningful manipulation with the sliding gesture. Either change/improve on that or make virtual gamepad buttons to move the pieces and everything else instead. 3 stars for the old school Tetris theme though. Hiscore 230k lv15 top out."", ""Nice game, but needs improvements. On higher speeds, it becomes unplayable too soon. Rotating of minos is sometimes too difficult, it gets locked in place too soon. An option for Bluetooth controller is a must. It's barebone, it works, themes are nice, ads are not a big problem, fix the controls and add more game mods in the future"", ""Really happy that we finally get a simple official game just for playing Tetris. Works and looks great. I usually hate phone Tetris controls, these are alright, but I would love to see more classic screen-button controls as they are much more accurate and fast for high levels. You just can't keep up dragging it around. Also, the game screen has so much empty space, you should scale it up."", 'Good tetris game with potential to be great. Controls are holding back this game. In my mind I know exactly where I want the pieces to go but cant execute it quickly enough due to finicky touch controls. You tend to either move too much to the left or right or sometimes rotate the piece unintentionally while moving. Controls need major work. Last thing a gamer wants is game mechanics holding them back because of a poorly implemented touch screen system.', ""This game is the best version of Tetris on mobile that I have seen! Phenomenal job, it's simple, easy to use, you jump straight into a game and you're playing. The controls feel great and only $5 to remove ads love it. I also love how there's themes to change the look of the game and they aren't behind IAPs which is appreciated. Thank you for this game, much better than EAs version, I don't know why but the EA Tetris Mobile always felt a little off 🤷\u200d♂️ anyway hats off to you guys 5 stars."", ""Great Tetris game, needs a bit of polish. I look forward to more Tetris content from this dev. Couple of tweaks that would significantly improve the UX: - make android back button actually take you back in menus - let me change sensitivity - ideally some different music options I've also found the touch controls quite unresponsive at very high speeds - blocks lock in very quickly when I'd expect them to respond to a rotation or movement. Not sure if this is a problem, though.""]"

Which would have made it a perfect game, having taken a year or so. But sadly, no. The makers of the game have become greedy, adding more (yet to be invented) games onto the end. This is disappointing...because the actual game itself was entertaining and challenging. So only 4 out 5 on all fronts. Makers.. You must learn to know when a good thing should end. Its a shame."", 'I genuinely love the game, been playing it for a year. But with the updates,,its getting annoying. But I still continue on updating them. But there are times that I havent played in a while but then when I open the application, it requires another update! Again... And I just did updated it. This game is really fun for me but too much updates is getting annoying.', ""I did love this game. Still do in a way. But once u reach level 800 or just over, u have no choice but to use your boosters or play the levels over and over and over again it gets so hard that you can't move on without going forward. When I first started playing this game I loved it so much cuz you didn't make it impossible without boosters or to pay. I will not pay. So now the fun is gone I'm losing interest in the game now."", 'This is a puzxle game removing coloured blocks and other. There are many games out there like this, so nothing new and that gets boring. The rewards for puzzling are that you can see how the adventure continues. Sound and graphics look good, but no voice over (would have been nice). If you quit the game it takes a life away of your current status, not ok.', 'I left a review the other day at four stars,.. I am now lowering it to three due to the annoying pop up ""Use this power up to help you win the game!!"" After Every. Single. Failed. Game... where before it only happened after multiple losses, which was tolerable. Now, it\'s making me want to stop playing. I will use my power ups when I please, not because the game pushes me to, so that they become depleted, therefore pushing you to spend money and buy more. I don\'t like it.', ""ABSOLUTELY GREAT GAME. can honestly say this Is the only game I haven't got bored of. The graphics and story are great to the point you want to see how it ends. I have now completed the current story so am going to be waiting for the new story to begin and see how it develops. The levels can be tricky but not so difficult that you get fed up of trying."", ""I love love this game! Definitely the best of all games in its genre. The storyline is captivating, the characters are fun and interesting and blasting through levels though some are quite difficult. This is the only game I've paid real money and IMO it's worth it though you could probably do so without spending money but it would probably take a lot longer. Anywho a great game overall."", ""Love the game. Even though I took a break, I came back. I liked the booster packs and wish they would return. And I enjoy the variety and frequency of special events now. Like the current concert event. Question. Will my points actually count this time and rank me on the leaderboard? The last time this event ran (last week), none of my points counted and I didn't place on the leaderboard at all (despite having enough points to be top 10 in my league). This led to me dropping leagues as well."", 'This is a lot of fun, unlike other match three/build games you\'re not stuck on the same level for days at a time. It\'s challenging but not impossible to pass. Also non of this.. "" you need four stars to inspect a chest and another four to open it"" . Im on level 786 and it hasn\'t gotten that way so I think it\'s safe to assume that it won\'t become that way. It\'s great :)', ""I was enjoying the game in the beginning. There are alot of ways to win items to help you through each level but the higher you go the more items you need to get through each level or pay money to buy the items. This game is enjoyable but the higher you go the less fun you have because if you don't buy bombs you will be stuck on the same level for quite sometime."", ""Very Addictive!! I absolutely love this game! In only a few days I've made it past lvl 300. The club's are great and helpful for getting lives without needing fb friends (always a plus) and there are plenty of events taking place all the time that getting extra goodies like unlimited lives, gold, ect are easy to come by. All around a great game and the story line is mysterious and entertaining enough that I just keep coming back for more. I love everything about this game!! 10/10 and will rec!!!"", ""I have tried a couple dozen different games. Most I have deleted after only playing for an hour or so. This one I've played for weeks! Past level 2000 now. Some of the levels are challenging, some easier. Story line is interesting, fun interaction between characters. Afraid if I reach the end/last level that I may never find another game I really enjoy!"", ""This game is so very challenging and a blast to play. Up to level 2500 after hundreds of hours of FREE fun. I haven't spent a penny but the levels ARE attainable with strategy and luck. I would have given it 5 stars but I've had to uninstall it and reinstall 3 times due to freezing up and stuttering glitches at times. The only complaint is the wait time between levels when the game gets into the Legendary Arena. I want to play the game; not play against others! Otherwise it's AWESOME!"", ""Fun game but very frustrating. You run out of lives so quickly then have to wait 15 minutes for a new life. Puzzles get inpossible as you go along somtimes you have to lose moves to get to where you need to be because the game is designed to make you purchase boosters to advance. And reshuffling only happens when you have one move left and then it's too late. Getting frustrating now to play. You can ask for lives but that takes time to get."", ""I love the game, great pass time when I'm bored, and the story is really interesting and entertaining. But I think there is a glitch with the point system. Like I have 2 moves left or something and then wait for the game to play on, it says I have 29 coins, then when I tap to continue, it say 26 and I receive 26 instead of 29. That's just a bit weird."", ""Just started the game and I am really enjoying it. The match squares is really very good, and easy to play unlike some games. Re - building things is very easy and the finished result is extremely good, and pleaseing to look at, can't wait to see what the rest of the island turns out to be like."", ""I live this game. Finally a game that doesn't get so hard after playing a few boards. It is very enjoyable and if it keeps getting harder a little at a time and then easier for a few boards and goes back and forth from easy to hard to easy again and so on. Thank you so much for making an enjoyable game."", 'Grood graphics and interesting game play. Coins are hard to earn but quick to spend. Rewards are given for teams and individuals Once advanced, it takes more stars (completed levels) to do even less advanced tasks on the island making it difficult to progress too quickly. Harder levels give slightly more coins but should also give 2 stars considering it takes 2-6 to complete any simple task. Lvl 500+', ""I really liked this game from the beginning. But now I'm on level six hundred and something,and I try to go spend my stars on one of the challenges or missions and it makes the noise but the screen freezes up. doesn't do anything doesn't take my stars and then it freezes and won't even let me ex out of the screen to go back and play more levels. Taking away three stars until this is fixed I may not even ever play it again"", ""This game is SO great! The levels are doable without having to purchase anything extra, the storyline is more interesting than most other similar games, and it doesn't take a ridiculous amount of stars to complete tasks! There are competitions and challenges that reward you greatly, there are no ads, and it is completely addictive! Definitely won't be playing any other game!!"", ""I am stuck on level 513, there is absolutely NO way to even attempt this level, I spent $10.00/gold coins on boosters but no help. I just emailed the developer my concerns, I might get forced to delete. I really like this game and have put a lot of effort into my progress. Don't get sucked into even starting this game, levels will get impossible as you get to higher levels."", 'This app sucks. The higher you go the harder the puzzles, more stars needed to complete quests and less control over how things look. You no longer get to choose how the end product looks. Kinda boring. You can tell the developers have gotten lazy and greedy. The graphics suck and you are unable to make choices on how anything looks after a certain point. Youre basically paying to win levels with no rewards.', ""Hate these type of game where you need a star for everything you do even for the simplest of thing. For instance at the begining of the game a plastic vial comes out of the statue and lands beside your feet and you need to use a star to pick it up. There's no need, surely the game should be focused on the designing aspect and not using stars for everything you do!"", 'Really enjoy this game but I think an update would be good and give at least 2 or more stars when winning a hard level. Sucks only one star is given per win. Also, instead of taking all earned ""blow-up\'s"" when we loose a level I think it should just knock us back down to the previous one each time. More coins should be given for each win. I\'ve never won more that 70.Mostly around 20-35 each. We also need more options to buy rockets and rainbow circles that doesn\'t include real money.', 'Love the story and a good puzzle, but when your ability to solve the puzzle is left to algorithm that is always changing, no fun. Especially that you are losing 10 or more lives at each leave (I’m at 863 ) going nowhere. This is very frustrating and it supposed to be relaxing.  Rene', ""Since the most recent update when I try to claim my daily reward I do not always get it. Also the higher levels are pretty much impossible to beat without buying coins. Considering it takes 500 to add 5 moves or anywhere from 450-950 to add boosters, the coin win per level should be raised. When you only receive 30-50 coins per level you're forced to spend money to continue playing (unless u want to spend days trying to beat one level ) Developers this is a good game, please dont get greedy."", ""I must say being dedicated to this game for some time the most frustrating part is the fact that an apparent attempt to keep you playing is a derivative of the system making it impossible for you to win certain levels until you've spent sufficient time on the app. Pisses me off actually- please be fair guys I get the whole business aspect for AD time etc but seriously it's so obvious."", ""I love this game so much, it's only so extremely frustrating that it doesn't zoom out more... Everything is so close up, after all my long hours of playing and rebuilding I like to zoom out and see my progress in whole but the game only allows you to see one spot at a time :("", ""Not like other buy this & that not going anywhere. I've started game seems fun so far. You can get ahead. ♡I have had the chance to play this game longer than I Ever Anticipated I would. Yes, I'm addicted! Dare I say involved. Try this game. Be an Island Owner."", 'Very frustrating because a few times when i liaded the game it goes back 20 or 30 levels. I was on level 1279 and when i went in the game again it started at level 1232. Happened a couple of times before as well. Or the game goes blank then it goes back a couple of levels. I always connect ti facebook..', ""I am unsure of what occurred to have the game not allow me to play without internet for an entire week , when I had been playing for a month without problems. I played your game daily, and now at a level over a thousand , not able to play, mad me so mad. Upon returning home, and after writing my rating, I felt so bad when I went to play ( forgetting it wouldn't work ) only to have the game now no longer saying ' no internet connection' . Puzzling. Lol yay i can play and you get a 5"", 'Great game. I found it quite addictive. The graphics are awesome and soothing. I wish the lives get replenished faster, but those are the rules of the game. I found the puzzles intelligent and though at higher levels, they were tricky. But still fun to do', ""Really like the game. Graphics are ok. But when your playing to make stars, the game cheats. Have a multi colored arrow, which should take out all in it's path, or a bomb, but when you use these plays they mysteriously leave items behind. I've noticed several of these issues. It wants you to get a certain amount of colored blocks, but you will never have that many of those blocks, on the board to get. Just another way to get us to buy, buy, buy. Which I will NEVER do. It's just a game."", ""This game is getting crazy and lazy to people who have played for quite some time. Before every 7 days you would get free play time and boosters now it's only 2 powerups and I finished a competition in 3rd place with my team and got nothing I emailed them on it and was told they would look into it and didnt even give me the reward I earned since the last few updates the game is ridiculous I may uninstall if its not fixed soon its not fair to people who play daily like me and my team do."", ""don't get alot of infect u only get very very little bit of cash when uve finished a levels so can't buy stairs either, & what's with the inventory finding all of those items~thing's and then not even using the stuff?!?! WHY NOT I DON'T GET IT???, Ps, but I am extremely hooked with the game, just give abit more stuff plsssss"", ""Got so tired of all the work you got to go threw just to get ahead just a little!! We spend more time trying to clear boards to win a star for what? Just to move one item? Come on now!!!! I like to build a nice island but to much stuff to go threw and it's just not worth it anymore!!!"", 'Brilliant game absolutely love it, but sadly after completing Atlantis and paying for stars to have the party on the beach, then being told to wait for new levels which I was happy to do and play the legends thing, something happened said cloud or current game both the same level it reset and I now have to do Atlantis all over again, that about another 300 levels', ""The only thing from giving a 5, I just started I expect it to be more difficult. I could go either way....we'll see \U0001f928. UPDATE: This game is so much fun. It deserves 5 stars hands down. And the puzzles are not too difficult. Fun, and I think I'm becoming addicted Lol 😍Love the interaction with the characters 💖💖💖. Thanks for the reward. Still playing and having fun, need more teammates though:)...plenty of rewards makes time go by. Very generous 😊💖"", ""After wooping your ass over 250 levels !!! I find your game being a degenerate game Absolutely useless.. what hurts the most is I really liked the game , yes sore loser but more important sore ass web designer 1/31/2020 I am now over 650 levels and i really like your game/app and I appreciate all the fun I've had trying to figure it out, my grandson even helped me in many levels, lol, yes he did, hope you continue the game bc i will... Ok if not , build another just as fun game bc we had fun"", ""Better than most! Many of these games seem to require you to spend money to advance very far.

At first I was pleasantly surprised by a cute Disney puzzle game aimed at kids. It seemed like the difficulty level was tailored for the younger demographic that would be lured to the ultra cute graphics. But once you get to around level 100 the difficulty cranks up to the point where the puzzles are entirely dependent on luck or power-ups. You're going to need a lot of power-ups which will cost you real money."", 'Challenging and keeps you interested to progress the story line.

Thank you for downloading our game.
We're constantly working to make Crazy Dino Park better for you. Stay tuned for more updates","[""This becomes more grindy than MMOs at around level 10. The levels get more expensive, you don't get more digs, and you become less and less likely to get a dig site that has what you need. Early levels? Oh like 5 stones and 3 fossils per. Later? 9 stone (you can't mine more than 6 per level regardless) and one fossil, which is where the grind is. You can advance without paying, but oh my God you can literally hit end game WoW before getting anywhere in this"", 'Fun game. Watching ads is required if you want to progress quicker, but hasn\'t been bothersome. I\'m glad is more of a collection play style rather than having to ""raise"" your dinos (like feed them and such, I personally don\'t like those types of games). It\'s a good time passer but also doesn\'t require you to constantly check on your park. The one thing that I think could be better is the frequency of ""quests"", like finding Kevin or digging extra bones. I think they should be more frequent.', ""The fact that the only complaint I have about this game is that I can't play it enough should say everything! It's got all of the aspects of the other games that I love, all rolled into one! The fact that I also LOVE dinosaurs has made this game my new obsession! A well earned 5 stars!!!!! 😁😁😁"", 'Its a good game, bit the only issues ive had if money cap and the gems you own a park they shouldnt be a money cap. The gems i mean you dont earn enough to get the stuff you need or want and you have to buy them now i underatand its a way for the developer to make money but still for people with a limited income its not worth buying them.', ""Eearning money is too hard and progress in anything needs minimum of 2 hour count down. As for opening an egg, beat me, 58 hours in early stages of game is sucks. Fighting is a one time price and there will be a point that you can't proceed further ahead. Very cute creatures but game encourages you to buy a gem. Wasted."", 'This is one of the best game i had played ever But only 4 stars bcoz it lacks many things Like need to break piggybank in game by real money thus i m disappointed by this. And the dinosaurs are not that much attractive. Anyway this game is best for time pass By the way doing time pass everyday i had reach level 60..😉😉 If you are playing the game Then my id is here. #1a-0a87-4c82.. Play game give me gifts i will give you.. Thank you..🙏🙏', ""There are some major cloud save bug and this review for the developers... Some days ago I had saved my game through cloud save and the next day when I opened the game, the complete save game has changed , where I was at level 16, it changed to level 32!! Then I connected my account again and now I am in 4th level and it just changes every time. Please fix this and please I ensure that my phone is not rooted, nor having viruses, hacked and I'm not using the hacked version of the game or anything."", 'I like the silly graphic style used - some of the dinos really are crazy. One big criticism is that the dynamite just keeps getting more expensive with no additional benefit. In most games you get greater ""power"" or more of something as the price increases but not here. Possibly the price maxes out but starting at 20000 I\'m now paying over 70000 for the same 20 uses. I really find that this slows the game down a lot. Considering how many ads you\'ll probably watch it feels way out of balance.', ""Thank you for listening to me and now the game is AWSOME because you helped it and again thank you oh and before I forget here is how to make your game a little bit better : 1. put more challenges and not only whence you are broke 2. Make the dinos pen faster like in 1hour -30min 3. Get dimonds without having to pay real money since I am only 9 almost 10 I don't have money so it is hard to get diamonds. So those are my recommendations for the game And thank you (again)😁😁😁😁😁"", 'The game is just too slow. It is dragged down by a minigame that relies on random chance and that costs a Increasing amount each time you play. Very little other gameplay. I played ""Disco Zoo"" which is very similar to this game. One difference in that game is the main minigame had a small amount of strategy and so it felt less like chance and more like a skill that could be improved upon. Also each minigame level cost a set amount that did not change.', ""Great game it's been more than a year I've been playing this and I still like it. The only problem I'm still facing is the pvp battles need to be changed as even after having the same dinosaurs, trophies of transferring the dinos and same level the attack powers are different without even using the power cards Edit: yes that's what I'm saying that even after having the same totems the attack powers is different for same level dinos"", ""some of the barriers are based on luck more than the usual grinding. Also if you go into offline mode you'll lose whatever progress you made since your last online login. Multiplayer system is wack, I've got maxed out dinosaurs but cant make it anywhere past the 100 trophy parts. I really just wanna unlock the new area to find new things"", 'Basically, you try and get as many different species of dinos and prehistoric animals as you can by digging them up. Then you level them up by combining two at same level. The higher the level, the stronger your animal. Then you can go to the arena to fight different opponents. Note, i can.t figure out if i.m playing actual pple or bots. But it.s fun lol. The higher your animal level, the more fight, block, speed, and lasting power it has.', ""I used to really like this game but I am now at the stage where I cannot progress any further. Some digs cost me £250,000 each time so it takes me a long time to get that money. Also I have to gain higher points in the multiplayer arena in order to meet my objectives and progress - but I have a very slow reaction speed so I will never get there. And as you lose points every time you lose a battle, I don't want to try the battles as I am likely to lose! Please improve this to help!"", 'Overall a great game with tons of stuff that can be done. Why one star? Because the PVP matchmaking is horrible. Really horrible. I\'m on rep level 25 and get matches with people that have a rep of 60+. Including much better dinosaurs. Fix that and you get 4, maybe 5 stars. As long as the MM is that badly done it\'s just one star. Edit after the reply of the devs: No, the MM is not balanced in a decent way. I\'m rather good at tapping the perfect point but in 1 of 2 fights two of my dinosaurs get rekt by one dinosaur of my opponent. I like the game but PVP is a mess imo. You (the devs) say: ""a higher level doesn\'t mean the opponent has better dinosaurs"" - plain wrong from my experiences. That said, I find myself to be ""the OP one"" sometimes. From like 40 PVP fights I had I dare to say that just a single one was exciting. The rest tended to be unfair. ""It is currently in an optimal condition."" is a joke to me, seriously.', 'Hi... So I absolutely love Crazy Dino Park. They become like your children lol. Do have one small issue that has only now started happening. When i watch a ad for 3 more spades, it just kicks me off the ad or doesnt give me my spades. Have restarted the game as while as my phone.', 'awesome game! well done! I want to ask you one thing: the opportunity to ""make"" eggs..eggs are so few and I like to be more eggs, something like an breeding building? Maybe to choose whom dinosaur want to give birth? More egg breeders too? Something like that.. thank you! Oh, and bank and tickets more upgrades!', ""Described as build a park and discover dinos; actually you are forced to do arena battles against other dinos to progress in the game. The mechanism is very difficult as it requires very fast, precise tapping. This means anyone with any kind of hand or eye problems struggles to play it. So instead of a calm dino collecting game, it's a frustrating trigger action game. Make it optional, or be honest in your description - it's a battle game."", '** update 2/8/20: they claimed they would fix the issue with he wawel dragon taking 6 months to get. They released an update and literally nothing has changed. It was great until now. I got to level 115 and I am STUCK. the wawel dragon is only available for 48 hours once a month. I calculated that it would take me 6 months to get that dragon and be able to pass level 115. 6 months to pass one level is ridiculous. Dont download it. Waste months of my life on this game to get stuck now sucks.', ""This game is really nice, collecting dinosaurs, making them fight, it's really cool, I have one problem with the game and that is that the ticket booth doesn't receive coins and my dinosaurs dont heal after a fight if I kept the phone offline, a request to the developers to fix this problem"", ""I reached the sapphire league and should have been awarded 60-something gems but I didn't get my jgems. Am I the only one that's dealing with this? My score was halved and the the season started over but I never got my gems I'll be more than happy to give this game 5 stars but losing out on more than 60 gems is enough to make me want to uninstall the game"", 'This game is kind of cool but, when I finally found the spotted egg I waited 26 hours for it to hatch and when it finally did, that was the last I saw of it. What gives? Getting extra gems is next to impossible because I dont spend real money on fake money.', 'cant even get past the tutorial after you go to the 1st dig site it tells you to press the box thing ones i press it a black screen pops up and then disappears and then im stuck on a the screen with the box in the top left corner and the little car at the bottom and i cant press anything and when i come off to restart the game it starts from the beginning and it happens again', ""This game is BS every time you dig for bones it costs more and more and the game knows what bones you need so to dig for them costs even more and those bones become harder to find. I'd go as far to say none existent. It also takes forever for eggs to hatch 11 hours per egg exactly. My son enjoyed this game to start with as it seemed like a good game but a few hours in and he hated it, especially when we realised you have to fight other dinos to make money for digs. Uninstalled!"", 'Got to level 131. Cannot proceed because of the 500 trophies requirement for Arena. The game is literally creating a wall that I cannot pass so there is no reason to play anymore. Nothing else in the game is relevant if you cannot get more levels and evolve the park.', 'Awesome game. Loved it so much. Graphics are good and some of these dinosaurs are so cute. However it would be really great if you add more mini games for earning diamonds and coins. Other than that all things are amazing about this game.', ""after pubg this is one of the best game I've ever played so far..its been 2 months I'm playing this... good graphics and no ads, this really awesome game with multiplayer battle. I loved it soo much,I would recommend to everyone that you must try atleast once😍😘"", 'Very Slow Gameplay, Gets Boring Fast Edit to dev reply: your reply was neither helpful or furthering a conversation. I more coins thsn I can spend. Spending 8k each time coin to dig 30 times to complete a dino is boring. How do you suggest making this more engaging?', ""Do not install it if you want to play it offline. Golds are not running when you're offline it is hard to earn gold. This game needs to play online. Poor graphic gameplay should be offline mode only. Bye bye CDP you waste 2 days of my time by trying it."", 'Annoyed with the arena, am always second to attack even when my first dino gets knocked I get to the make the next strike which I do but only for one move then it swaps back to me being second in line giving the computer an unfair advantage really frustrating', ""it's very easy and very addictive game i can't rop my phone be coz of this game im totaly hooked in this game i play this for 12 hours. i hope you guys update a new vwrsion of this where we can collect daily chest or daily supply so its more addictive to play and more ads so i can break all the rocks its just annoying that you only have one chance to break em all wish you all a goodluck ."", 'Honestly a fun and cute game. If you like a game you dont need to spend money on and can come back whenever you want this is the one. I spent money on it. Only do it to games that are worth it.', 'Are you kidding me! This game id?fun until it becomes the most repetitive thing ever. Im literally sick of digging for the same bones over and over. Then they throw in some weird colored dino that doesnt mate and it just infuriates me', ""I'm level 40, Why should I fight someone in level 107 or higher? They had 3 cards, their shadows was scary, They were more powerful than my fighters and their defenses were better and attacked first! Just one of them can kill 2 of my fighters, My mechanical Dino took looong time to repair 😣 I update all my dinosaurs and it's not my fault if others in my level don't. You should encourage them to update their dinos, Not disappointing one who does. 😔 This update is not fair. Pleeeeease fix it ☹️"", ""It's a good game .there are a lot of activity that a tired person want to refresh them mind So think of it is a good game them .who want the peaceful and relaxing game ."", 'Good Game.

- Family Hotel's story is just beginning. Every day we correct mistakes and make the game better for you to love.","[""Loving this game, it's surprisingly addictive and the story is really interesting. I only wish it was more generous with rewards, like more than (a base amount of) 50 coins per round, also coin rewards when you level up (instead of boosters). And maybe shorter recovery time because like I said, this game is addictive. Other than that I have no complaints really; the graphics are superb, and the gameplay is simple, challenging at times but still player-friendly. Looking forward to more."", ""sometimes the level is almost impossible to win without boost / extra move but it still fun to play and not that frustrating, the character are interesting enough to care for the story. My main issue there's a bug in the garden area, I already pass those part of the story but the furnitures I've got suddenly dissappear and I can't even edit them. I hope it can be fixed"", ""Well.....got to waste time until my lives refilled on my other games, and this one actually got hard really quick. Level 30 and up (stuck on 37) I've used everything I could. I know the levels are supposed to get harder, but this got hard way too quick. Hard to enjoy the game when you can't do anything. BTW:one I'm on LV750 the other LV1700"", ""Please make the puzzles easier to play. Im really interested in the story but the difficult levels just make me want to stop playing. Or it would be nice if you could add a story mode/puzzle mode with easy/hard difficultly for people who are interested in either-- Edit: game takes forever to load. After the update loading screen has been stuck on 50%-- Edit 2: It took about 4-5 mins at 25 Mbps-- Edit 3: Thanks for the prompt reply! And yes it's loading much faster now ❤️"", ""I'm really enjoying the game right now! I would recommend that more difficult levels have more keys as a reward though :) I hope we will have events that give infinite lives because I really want to progress more with the plot. Update: Even though the app says new levels were added with a recent update, I do not see any new levels :("", ""I started playing this game and was actually starting to like it, but as I started getting into higher levels, the game became increasingly harder and the moves they give to complete the level were lower. I had to use all my special moves in each level just to complete it. I have no problem with hard levels but they dont give enough moves to complete it. I no longer wish to play and it's to bad because I like the game. I even spent money on it because I liked it. It's to bad. ☹😢"", ""I love the game so much. Especially, the movements, it feels real. However, I suggest to give us some decorations that are pleasing to our eyes and that get along to each part of the hotel. But it's great tho. Would play this again and again."", 'The plot is great (redemption of the ""barbie"" MC and the chemistry between her and the strict-but-kind guy feels refreshing) compared to the generic match-3-design game plots. However, the game would benefit A LOT on events (e.g. 1-hr infinite lives). Due to this lack, I\'m not as keen as to paying for coins/powerups. Hope this gets updated soon!', ""Well i love the game style, but its all soooo slow, especially the puzzles. Making moves on the puzzles needs to be faster, it's like its playing in slow motion. Other than this, the game seems fun. Please speed up the puzzle play though otherwise i will get bored really quick and end up uninstalling it 🙁"", ""The game that spending everything that is and I don't really like it like that I like him and all that this one is a little bit bad so that's why I gave it 3 stars I don't really like the characters or the family hotel the hotel yes life and the food is horrible I have hardly believe that a child will eat that I don't even know it's but I'm not trying to install the game but it's little bit bad the hotel is trashy the Mama don't have any and a baby can I find me is that a single family"", ""Love this game so far but from experience the beginning to these games are ok untill u advance in the game it's then things seem to go pear shaped and one example trying to beat a stage but all the pairs stay on the opposite side of the grid hope this game isn't like others Iv'e played and deleted 😡😱"", 'This game app has a Great! Story line. Full of Mystery and intrique. The gameplay is Challenging.And the Graphics are Great! So I would advise after a lot of understanding how this app works. For Google play Store gamers to give it a try. Thank you! Kudos!👍 Developers.', 'Some challenges are ridiculously hard. Makes it tough to stay interested on those challenges. Too many silly activities, like ""talk to"" someone. Come on, I joined this game for the chance to design, renovate and characters.', ""Nice game. BUT... My tasks wont load. It will get to 85% and stop! I don't want to reinstall it because I'd lose all my stars for decorating. Very very irritating!!!!!"", 'I love the story the hotel and the two main character i think they will mean to be at end😘but so sad always hazle always update and need to download..why like that? Im so much love this game but one day come,ive no choice but to uninstalled this game apps im on more than one hundred level now...', ""Just downloaded it but so far it's refreshing and different, I will give an update in a few months when I really have had a chance to play and know more about the game. As of now I'm giving it a 5 stars because it started out awesome. I hope to continue to give a 5 ☆ rating. I really like the storyline so far."", 'Tsk. Not loading with or without internet. Always stuck at 44% Edit: I uninstalled the game, then install again. I played. Now I decided to use the last game I played that I bind in my fb account . And now it stuck at 50% for ald ten minutes. Seriously. 😕', 'Just starting chapter 3. Clear instructions and fun! Why not 5 stars then? I am not keen on the design options, they are boring and unimaginative.', ""Still new to this game but I think it's cute so far want to play a little bit more before I rate it 5 stars played till it wouldn't load more than 43% tried several times decided to start over and give another try still really like the idea and the game"", 'Seems good as far as levels and storyline so far, BUT every time i go to choose decor the entire game freezes and i have to force close and restart the app! Its frustrating.', 'Every game like this is with the match tiles. Boring and not enough lives, now i have to wait 10 min before you get 1 life to play one little matching the tiles game. For the rest graphics are ok.', ""It lags frequently on my tablet and force quits a lot. I think it would be a fine game if it wasn't for those reasons. It's hard to play when it keeps closing and lagging."", 'Love the game i play it all the time but for some reason its stopping and going back to my main screen. Can you fix the problem please would love to continue', ""Six keys to put the centerpiece in the sundial?!? Seriously?!? Ridiculous. The frequent popups to buy the doggie bank, and to buy perks to help you win the game, are too much. I refuse to waste my money on a game just to win. A total waste of time. Not only that, but it's a big battery drainer too. Uninstalled."", ""I like the game but some of the levels are so hard you can't clear them without spending money. I have spent enough on this game. Hope I don't have to delete it."", 'The game is good but level 11 is so hard always show on screen no extra moves why there is move but the game is unable to give move . The game developer is fool to made this type of game they wasting time of users and there own time also.', 'Would rate 5 if the wait time is not too long. Plus, to buy with real money is really not worth it. However, like playing the game for now.', ""It's fun but it always said I didn't connect to the internet to load. I am sure my internet connection is fast since I don't have any problem with other apps."", 'so far so good. but at level 301 i played that level twice and there no candy anymore but at left it said i must find 2 more candy even tho theres no candy left. why???', 'It says ""loading the furniture"" since 3days(although i have a very good internet speed) and for this i couldn\'t proceed to the next level. Very annoying😔.', ""It's difficult to change deco that is hidden behind walls because the walls are in the way. Like the small bathroom you can't change the sink because you can't get to it."", ""Out of this world, absolutely amazing. I'm absolutely addicted to the gameplay. So it was nothing new, but what I wasn't expecting was the story. In games like candy crush or homescapes you have a basic point A to point B plot or none at all. With this game your choices actually affect what's going on in between levels! The gameplay is the perfect amount of challenging with easy to grasp mechanics, especially for a patient soul. Completely addicted to this game, you won't regret downloading!"", 'The game is your typical decoration match 3 game. It is entertaining and the characters look nice. There is a slight problem though when watching ads to get extra lives/power-ups. After the ad plays and I close it, the screen goes black with no way to go back to the game, except for closing it and starting it again, meaning you lose what you watched the ad for nothing. Please, fix that.', ""The game is great; it has a good story line as well. The only problem would be the rewards. It would be good if there was a 'unlimited life for a specifc short amount of time' after each chapter like some other similar games have. Because some of the hard levels take many attempts to clear and you end up waiting a long time(maybe even days) to clear them if you don't have boosters. Also, 50 coins and 100(for special levels) is wayyyy too low when a single extra life costs 1000."", 'I love the game but it takes sometime to download the furniture even with internet.... Hope you can fix it... Because i want to play continously...', 'The reason for the 1 star is that the game keeps flashing which is EXTREMELY annoying and hard on my eyes, makes me very ill and the flashing has gotten worse... almost every 3 seconds. Can be bad for people who have health issues. Hope developers FIX this as it is a known cause for creating epilepsy attacks.Otherwise, LOVE the game! Great game play and excellent storyline. I actually watch and listen to the story as it evolves rather than push ""skip"".', ""Frustrating! It's a lovely game. But it is so hard to get the keys. I've been stuck on the same level for 2 days because it's too hard. Shame you dont get free keys daily or other ways to earn them like when you level up. To solely rely on the candy crush style game to earn the keys to actually play the game is a bit frustrating as I'm at a stalemate and no longer enjoying it. Finding you have to pay and purchase things to help you pass a level to earn a key. Guess that's how money is made"", 'Way too hard to load. Takes forever. I have many other similar games and this one is too cumbersome. Uninstalling.', 'Totally awesome! Great graphics I enjoy the role play in remodeling and I just enjoy the story very much this is the kind of games I enjoy playing I appreciate this very much', ""Its a nice game, BUT..... the tap to skip at the end of a level bugs out 9 from the 10 times, and u cant skip the final part, with the leftover moves. Plus, the walls bug out too, when u want to place new items/ furniture. They are either completely gone, or not dissapearing when u need to choose a new setup in the bathroom for example, so u can't see any of the 3 choices. Very annoying. Please fix it and i will improve my review. Also, your booster/ gold offers are too expensive""]"

After completing a round it will shut down back to the main menu, thus losing my game data and it does this at least once every time I play. I've had some really good points scored, all for nothing! And all points count when you are completing missions. It also takes your life so you can't redo the level. Sort it out JamCity!!!"", 'Would have given 5 🌟, but since the Feb 2020 Star Wars update, game constantly glitches. By this, I mean whenever I make a match with emojis, the game is freezing. A few seconds can pass by stuck on that screen, then making another match does the same thing, & again using any sort of power up. Also, it\'s not dropping any items onto the screen, & when I go onto the items section, it says ""Unlock at level 4"". I\'m level 27 atm...', 'Edit: If I could give this game ZERO stars, I would. It crashes constantly and restarting takes excessively long. Playing is no longer fun, and I am going to uninstall and tell all my friends on Facebook not to play either. Oh, and don\'t be fooled by the computer-generated ""responses"" that tell you to contact support. Support doesn\'t exist. Your emails will go unanswered and ignored, just like mine were.', 'Disappointed. I use to love playing this game. But lately it is harder and harder to get certain emojis. They put on events with certain emojis and you try and get them to play the event and the odds of getting them are so low you never do. So you cannot play or complete the event. I always get emojis I already have in the diamond box and that is so upsetting because it takes so long to accumulate enough diamonds and I could just try my luck with a gold box for them. I get coins all the time.', ""I'm having a lot of fun with this game. It's foundationally a matching game. Each emoji gives different powers in the game. You level emojis up, win more emojis, work through the quest line, have options for daily quests, and play special event games. It's not very complex. It does not require guilds nor daily play. So why do I like it? It's just relaxing fun! Collecting new emojis is fun! And the matching games don't get harder as you level up, so you can actually do better as you get better."", ""Expensive and cute. It's neat to be able to send the emoji to friends and family, everyone has a favorite Disney character. But I can tell by the event style and price point that this game really wants your money. You -can- play for free, but do not expect to be able to access the CoOL eVEntS without dumping some diamonds. I wish they'd reduce their prices. 5 bucks for a chance at a new emoji? Steep, guys. Very steep."", 'This game is extremely fun and great for anyone who loves Disney!! Earn coins to collect different emojis who all have different and fun powers for helping in the game. Only reason it\'s not 5 stars is the OBVIOUS money grab. I get the game has to make money but it\'s almost unfair to people (children!) Who can\'t pay to get the ""exclusive"" emojis.', 'I enjoyed the game for the most oart but the enforced tutorial mode was beyond infuriating, it completely takes away the enjoyment of an otherwise fun game. i get that disney is aimed at kids who might need the simple instructions explained to them in a patronising eay, but there is no option to skip if you dont wish to be spoken down to by an app. Totally not worth playing as long as it retains this annoying feature, might as well play candy crush', ""This is my most favorite game but in the last 2 days i can't watch any ads to spin the bonus wheel, every time i hit the button to watch ads it kickes me out of the game completely. Please fix this as fast as you can, I'm not getting the power ups or extra lives i need and hate being kicked out to have to open and load all over again"", ""Infuriating to the core. I sent the developers multiple messages for 2 days and had to put up with multiple unresolved issues along with no help in getting all my missing coins and gems back. I have never felt so annoyed and furious. All my messages get issue closed replies when the truth is my problems with the game hasn't been resolved at all. It is both infuriating and disappointing. Every time I try to play a get more coins logo pops up every time its annoying."", ""I do like the game and it's premise. However, it is so obviously a cash grab that it is hard to rationalize spending my time on the futile attempts to collect 'rare' emojis. If the devs realized that there is more money to be made using a more subtle, less 'in your face gimme', the game would be more enjoyable for both sides. For example, Zombie Tsunami (not affiliated), an endless runner, has in purchase items but there is also a payoff for the player. Also, what is the point of limited lives?"", ""Used to be fun! What is the point of winning a character at end of the event if you need the character to play the event? I've been playing this game since it was released. I love seeing all the new characters but recently it feels like a pay to play which I never felt that way about this game before. Don't bother with this game unless you like sitting out of events."", ""After updating to android 5, the game freezes and crashes. It never did that when I was on kit kat (android 4.4). Using Tab S 10.5 and Tab S 8.4. I'm glad it works fine with my Note 9 and iPad mini 2. Once the freezing issue goes away, I'll update to 5 stars becuz it really is a great game. Thanks."", 'Very disappointing, you don\'t actually get collected emoji added to your keyboard instead they are images. Furthermore when you go to turn on Disney Emoji Blitz keyboard there is a warning stating ""This input method may be able to collect all the texts you type, including personal data like passwords and credit card numbers. It comes from the app Emoji Blitz."" This is unacceptable and a security risk, do not get this app if you value your privacy.', ""It's pretty fun, I just wish they'd reward you with more money so that it's not so hard to get new emojis. It takes like a week to build $15,000 - $30,000 (is the cost of a box with a new emojis in it) Also the 5 play limit is kinda lame too... Would like to play the game more without having to spend money. And the way the game sits right now... Is you can play for about... 15 minutes... That's it..."", ""This is a really fun game!! But it's one of those games that u hv to match three in a row but it's really easy and and i'm only 10!! But the game did say that u can text ur emojis but it didn't show me how for some reason and i hv been trying to find but can't. Well u should try it anyway!!

Unless you have your game linked to your Facebook account you will NOT get any progress back. If you've wasted money on anything with the game, it's your loss. Incredibly unhappy with this. They need to have another way to recover your emojis and progress. I've wasted years playing this game. Thanks Jam City for nothing... I really did enjoy playing this game"", ""I've tried emailing to get the situation resolved. I had this game installed on my old phone, I then got a new phone and tried signing into the game again with facebook as I have multiple times and I lost all of my emojis that I had. i worked really hard getting all of them and I am really upset about it. is there any way to get my progress back or am I juwt out of luck and have to restart everything? I've been playing to try and get my emojis back, hoping you guys would email me back about it."", ""I've been playing this game for years and I would love to give it 5 stars but lately certain emojis you can only get by purchasing a diamond box when you used to be able to win them through challenges... I want those emojis but I don't necessarily want to pay to get them and even if you do buy it you arent guaranteed the emoji that you do not currently have."", ""0 STARS! I am completely fed up with this game and all the glitches especially the one that will not allow me to download the updates unless I'm using wifi and yes checked all my connections and my downloads are set to download over any network however when using my data the game says it cant do it due to weak signal however no other app has a single issue also when I do try to download it keeps telling me to restart the app in order to start the download every single time so cant play it"", ""I used to love this game, now I sort of have lukewarm feelings towards it. It is still fun and addictive, won't deny that, but the fact that it has become so money oriented really takes the fun away! This is the only game I EVER spent money on but even when I buy additional diamonds I end up getting the same emoji I already won. This makes collecting new rainbow/diamond emojis near impossible, it's extremely frustrating and I'm quickly losing interest. Talk about ruining a great game..."", ""Game is cute and fun but becoming more trouble than it is worth. Game freezes waaaay too much making it impossible to play. JAM CITY is what it does now!! Developers have gotten too greedy. Diamond payouts are infrequent and blatantly low, while diamond box and charger costs are ridiculously high. Emoji keyboard is a security risk! I don't use it. Feb 2020 Star Wars update failed to update game properly. I have many emojis and used to enjoy game. It is ashame but I may have to trash it."", ""This game has turned into nothing but a money grab. They don't care about their player base, just the amount of money they can con out of people. The requirements for the events have become near impossible to complete without spending money. The new emojis they release have such low drop rate odds, that you feel you have to spend money or miss out. There are better games to play than this."", 'I, for one, agree with most comments. It\'s very frustrating to get a ""level up"" when you are trying to get a new emoji. I have made in app purchases and I have paid to get only the same emoji over and over. I\'m starting to lose interest.', ""Terrible. I've played this before now im forced to do the tutorial. Should give an option for that and also game used to be able to be saved via Facebook or gmail now no option to get back old game. I've put allot of money into this game and now new phone and all wasted. Going to uninstall."", ""I finish the tutorial and it says to connect to the internet and restart the game to download new content. Have been trying all day. Have uninstalled and reinstalled 3 times already just to redo the tutorial and get to this screen again. The game seems fun and the wife loves it but I haven't been able to actually play"", ""It's a great game but when will we be able to get Marvel characters? With that being said I have one problem. The percent rate on the Diamond Boxes is like waiting for Christmas day and then you find you have cancer. Also you should have just made the newest Star Wars box ONLY have The Child and The Mandalorian. Having Luke and Leia in the box is a waste."", 'Freezes or 2 emojis occupy one spot, sometimes i dont get all my gems also its taken me a little over 2 and a half years to get to the level im at,takes forever even playing a few times a day, also the prizes when you spin the wheel should be higher, i play this game faithfully 300 coins is a crappy prize and thats what i usually land on...it should be higher', ""It's honestly my favorite game, but won't be giving them 5 stars because they no longer will connect to Facebook, so when I switched phones, I lost all my previous progress. I had acquired SO many emojis, levels,etc. And I am back to starting all over again."", ""It's fun to play, but they've become very money oriented. And whenever you play 1 level, it takes coins away. I would only recommend if you are willing to spend money on gems and coins that you could easily earn in other games."", 'So I Really Love This Game It Just Suxs That The Only Way to up your emoji is by buying another box and hoping to get a double. Thats so stupid not to mention how much the boxes are plus that diamond box is 200 rubys which is crazy cause rubys are very hard to get. I just wish u either got more coins per round or that the boxes were less coins. Also the Daily challenge games are great but take to long to beat to win ur prize boxes', 'Fun so far, but my samsung note 9 isnt able to receive any of the emojis on my keyboard. Like what so ever. And any free spin I receive my phone sends me back to my home screen. No spin. And I have to reopen the app and try again. No luck so far.', ""DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS GAME. Its a total scam. Spent 12.99 on gem packs to try and get some Star wars themed things. Ended up with three of the same common character from a premium box. If you want certain characters you're going to be spending $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$. Not to mention there's zero depth and story, I understand it's a match 3 game but at least have a progression board similar to candy crush or Pokemon blitz. Terrible"", '!!!!!GET THIS GAME!!!!! I\'ve been playing this game for a little over a year now and I LOVE IT!!!!! There\'s sooooo many different ""challenges"" that change everyday, which helps in keeping the game fun, exciting and interesting, and when you complete one you get awesome prizes. They have a prize wheel you can spin 3times every few hrs.. I almost NEVER get hooked on games (or even write reviews) but this game has me hooked for life lol Definitely worth downloading!!!', 'This game is enjoyable. However, it is too difficult to get gems without using real money and not everyone is able to sppend money on games. There needs to be challenges that reward with higher gem amounts.', ""Really enjoyed this game and have spent quite a while building my collections. Had to restore my phone recently and all my progress is lost. No way I'm gonna spend time or energy trying to get back to where I was."", ""I am a little disappointed that a lot of the characters are not available unless you spend diamonds. I love the game, but can't afford to make the purchases. Not everyone has money lying around to put on a game. Give all of us the same chance to get the character."", 'Dear Lord, how long does your beginning tutorial have to be? PLEASE make this optional! I accidentally deleted the app from my phone and had to sit through ten minutes of required gameplay just to log back into my Facebook account. I already know how to play, please just let me play!!', ""Fun game. Very addictive. Great to see so many characters. Question though. How am I supposed to achieve an objective using specific characters if I don't have any in that character group?"", ""So much fun! Your lives renew faster than most games, so there's more chances for playing. About the only downside is when they run special events that you don't have the emoji for, but that's not every event, so still 4 stars.""]"

As an existing Portal fan, I am SO happy to see a mobile game and even more happy that it's fun, entertaining and has the same great humour as the original Portals. The puzzles ate enjoyable and very clever - enjoying this so much!! SO worth the money!!"", 'Ingenious puzzle game. Easy to pick up and play. You can play it for a few minutes at a time or get lost in it for hours. Really great STEM tool for kids and adults. Animations are top notch as is the humor. Added enjoyment for those who have played the Portal games as this game is in the same universe. The game even features GladOS as your sardonic guide. You do not need prior knowledge of the Portal games to fully enjoy this game. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!', 'Well worth the money, very polished and fairly easy to navigate once you get used to zooming in to place things. You just gotta push through the initial phase of it feeling a bit fiddly, couple levels in and you really start enjoying it. You also start to feel like you are finding a different solution to the one they expect you to find, which I really enjoy in any game. Very well made.', ""The game forces you to go online after being offline for a while. Worse yet, if you don't do that it won't let you play and just force crashes the game. This is ridiculous! I paid for it so it shouldn't matter if I'm connected to the internet or not, not to mention this game is fully singleplayer."", 'In love all over again. In my opinion, an absolutely perfect mobile port of Bridge Constructor Portal. Completed and loved on Xbox, now again on mobile. Thank you to all involved in the making of this game on any platform, one of my all time favorites!', ""Seems a fun puzzler. Graphics are decent enough for a mobile if nothing amazing. Reminds me of my days on portal. Loses a point as it didn't seem to do cloud saves so I can't play on my phone and tablet"", ""Game requires network connection after a period of time to verify the licence. This happens every couple of weeks it seems, should I known of this prior I likely wouldn't have bought the game.... The game is a bit boring at times and repetitive but otherwise it's quite fun and challenging. If the licence issue isn't a concern for yourself, I'd recommend this game granted you want a simple and short mobile game to play."", ""As a retired structural engineer I couldn't resist this game. It uses a part of my brain that was starting to atrophy (in retirement). It is quite entertaining. OSHA would have a fit, however. Definetly not a safe work environment."", 'Really enjoy this game. Some of the puzzles are extraordinarily tricky. The game has been freezing frequently recently though, hence the lower rating. Quite aggravating.', 'So far so good, on level 11. The game asks that all applications for statements of encouragement be submitted 273 days in advance, but there is no option in the game to fill out said paperwork. Idk if this is an option that is unlocked later, or in the dlc. I tried discussing it with my companion cube. My cube was very helpful and not forthcoming in the companionable way my cube is.', ""Can't pass the step where we have to build the first bridge. Removed all unwanted parts, added the new following instructions. Aaaaand stuck! Nothing to do, even quit game control is broken. Don't buy this game, it looks cool but you'll just waste you money and your time. Asked refunds."", ""Portal humor in a smartphone package, it's got a simple yet grueling game that makes you want to keep playing until that damned forklift boot-scoots it's way into the exit point. 5 stars for 5 dollars well spent."", ""Bought this game on my android device for my son as his device was getting fixed. I thought I would be able to share it through googe play family library but it will not let me do it. I emailed them several times ( 10 times ) but got on reply so I had to buy it again. Would have give it zero star but I can't. TECH SUPPORT NONE EXISTANT AVOID THESE GUYS THEY JUST TAKE YOUR MONEY."", ""The controls aren't great and the menus feel clunky. Separately the license verification can be annoying as I usually play game when I don't have internet access."", ""Surprisingly fun and creative for a bridge constructor. It makes you think out of the box and in unique ways. On brand for a portal game. The controls are fine, though I wish it were a bit easier to snap beams to joints. That's about the only nitpick I have so far."", 'Fantastic game! Could use a little polish... The gameplay is very fun, reminiscent of the source material. Only thing holding it back is the zoom control. A little twitchy, could be smoother for something so vital to the gameplay.', 'Very fun game. Just like poly bridge, but in the world of portal. The controls are pretty good as well.', 'I love portal games, I also like Bridge Constructor so this was a must buy for me. I love GLaDOS sense of humor, which is also present in this game.', ""Gameplay is smooth with 60fps , Controller is easily touching. I've spent a lot of time to deal puzzles in game. It's included DLC in game too."", 'An excellent puzzle. Simple yet hard to master. The ugly side is the low contrast between the bridge pieces and the background while in construction mode and the lack of accessibility options. A bigger font or a dark interface would help.', ""Wow. What a great game. And since you can BUY it, you don't have to watch ads. I miss the days of games not trying to make you buy something or watch a video every round."", 'As always, ""Headup games"" has produced another quality product, which is both fun, amusing, and challenging. If you liked any other bridge constructor games, this 1 is a must have.', 'Personally I am a huge fan of the portal games so the inclusion of references like motherboard just makes me smile although it could use some rough final touches and it would be perfect but otherwise its amazing', ""The controls ruin it, everything is way too small. It's unplayable for me."", 'Interesting game, good challenge. Can be frustrating at times and then you realize that you are over thinking it', 'Very fun and entertaining. Well designed, worth every penny.', 'Enjoying this gem immensely! Love the way it all play out in the physics world. The reminiscent of all time favorite Portal original game is an added bonus.', 'This game is very good. It uses the way that GLaDOS is a complete annoyance and gives you lack of information while subtilty telling you how to play.', ""The controls don't respond well, and the tutorial wasn't good. I had no idea what was going on and I couldn't even get pass the 1st level because it kept saying that the build wasn't valid."", 'Fun game, good polish. No micro transaction b.s., just some dlc for extra levels.', 'Super fun and engaging puzzle game with hilarious dialogue. Easily my favorite time waster', 'Just finishing introduction/ tutorial. Fun physics puzzles with a little humor from Portal to make it more fun.', 'A very awesome game. Easy to play but some mind solving construction.', 'Very creative and pretty addictive. An authentic Portal experience.', 'I loved the portal games so i had to get this. Its a similar concept but your building bridges to reach the end', 'Fun, controls slightly wonky. Good portal humor. Enjoying it so far!', 'Love the challenge 😍 and helps me think out side of the box', 'Feels like Portal. Ramps up quickly, with the basics learned after 3 levels. Great game.', 'Very fun and requires you to use your brain and focus', 'Fun logic puzzle game. Great for learning about Bridge supports.']"

Also, you have way less ads if any, than other games. Great job and please make more of all of them.', ""Usually don't play these kind of games because the puzzles are extremely hard or they want real money at some point. This game has a slight learning curb, but fun to play once you get the hang of it. Puzzles are challenging but not so difficult that you want to throw your device across the room. Good job developers."", ""OMG is this game hard. The puzzles are great but trying to figure out what is a puzzle or not and what does or does not open is a pain. There are no directions so you spend a lot of time clicking everything to see if it's important."", 'I genuinely love this game. This is my second game from the Adventure escape series and I prefer this one to the Hidden Ruins one. This one seems to get increasingly harder whereas the other one started off difficult straight off the bat. If you are choosing between the Adventure Escape games, choose this one!', 'I like this game a lot. This is the second by the same makers I\'ve played. Try asylum, it\'s awesome. There should be an ""are you sure you want to skip"" message before it lets you spend a bunch of hint stars on accident. I wanted to solve that puzzle with the family tree but accidentally hit skip.', 'Was a fun game until putting the letter together and the ""skip"" for 25 stars is so huge i accidentally touched it since its in the part of the screen to put the letter together. So i used up stars to solve something i was not needing solved. Very poor placement of that. Was a huge interruption of the game for me and a waste of potential hint usage.', 'Still pretty good, but an oldie I think. The zooming on the puzzles makes me dizzy and some of the clues are really not very clear. Also the hints are not as useful as they are in more recent games. Fortunately all these issues are not present in the latest games (which are usually a solid 5 stars)!', 'Addicting! I was looking for a different type of game since most of the ones out there are very similar. And this is exactly what I was looking for!! It challenges my brain and has a great storyline.', ""LOVE these 😍🤓\U0001f9e0😎😘 Such FUN, ROBUST, STIMULATING workouts for our brains/intellect! Here's something I just figured out n it's something they should've told us upfront (gee, would've sure made the first ones that much easier & MORE ENJOYABLE \U0001f928!) Anyways, for each new level/task, we're usually stuck wondering what the objectives/rules of each new riddle/challenge/puzzle are, and the pop-up phrases (when u tap each object/person) aren't ever enough! Just hit Hint -- the first's always FREE 😉!"", ""I like this game but it is almost too hard. I play games in this genre and am finding that I have to buy hints when I normally don't. I will edit my review if I figure this one out!!"", 'Nice variety of moderately difficult puzzles, however, it seems quite glitchy. I know what I need, but am unable to pick it up. Also, Back button and Skip are right next to each other, so I tapped Skip when I juat wanted to go back. Graphics are dated.', ""I would give this game more stars but the clues don't help. It gives you a clue to what you already know. For example as far as adjusting the emblem for the bird, it tells you that three rings move at the same time. Once all the rings are there you already know this. So it doesn't give you a clue on how to adjust it. They could tell people the flower goes at the top instead. Also when I was in the garden I tapped for the handle to make the water come out, it did noth till after I tapped hint"", ""Really good puzzles, challenging but not impossible. This is the second game I've played by these guys and they have both been fantastic."", ""That was great!! I played Asylum last night and this one today and I'll either be playing cult or carnival after I rate this. The puzzles weren't too hard until the billiard room. I won't go into detail for those who haven't played it yet, but that sucked lol. Eventually I got it but geez. Loved it, keep them coming!!!"", ""Frustrating. Got to a chapter where I knew the solution but the game had missed a step and not given me all the numbers I needed. Even the hints were convinced I had the numbers, but I didn't, I only had three of four. Was enjoying before then. Would like to continue playing if the dev can fix this bug. Spent all my points getting hints to a puzzle I already knew the answer to, but it wasn't that I missed something. Looks like something just didn't work correctly...."", 'Just awesome. The visuals and graphics are superb. The levels are a bit challenging, means you have to click at the screen to get an idea about your next move. Also the puzzles are a bit hard and it needs thought to solve it. Summing up it is a fine game and if you are lover of tough challenges this is for u!', ""This game needs some improving! Either the tasks are ridiculously easy n boring or too difficult or impossible to work out because the clues do not aid enough. And it will cut to the next scene when you haven't prompted it to yet. Annoying and frustrating. Also the dialogue between characters is not entertaining n pointless"", ""No instructions at all. The introduction is boring and doesn't make sense. I got to the point where I picked up the letter i and it automatically went into a white square on the side of the screen. No explanation for what the squares are for. The only other thing I can do is tap the lock to make it say that it is locked or tap the spot the i fell off to make it say it looks like a letter is missing. Tapping anywhere else does nothing.

The deeper into the game i got the more out of sync the hits got to the actual puzzles. For instance In the both the two consecutive numbers and coloured gears puzzles, the hint told me to pick up a plank! Also I found that the hint skip and back buttons were too close and accidentally wasted points by hitting the skip on several occasions. Other than that I LOVE THE GAMES', ""Is this really can be played in just 2 days? Or did I miss anything? The game is easy n quite relaxing, no rushing. It can be played without using real money. Love this kind of game. Wish the story can be longer so it's more interesting. I think I'll try their other games too"", 'The game is quite good but some parts are hard to understand. Also, the sensitive is not good, i cant touch some details but after close and open the game again, it work. So try to fix this, Haiku', ""Most enjoyable escape game I've ever played. It's full of puzzles. Teases your brain. Not too difficult or easy either. Well done guys. Hoping your'll will be making a similar one soon. In the meantime I think I will play it again."", ""Love these games. Great way to pass time and work your mind while having fun. Each chapter is short enough so if you quit a game part way throu and you have to start said chapter over it isn't too annoying."", ""Basically laggy. The artwork is good, but the plot doesn't captivate me. The puzzles are interesting, but some are just too easy."", ""I've really been enjoying this puzzle game. The puzzles are challenging, but not so hard that it's just frustrating. I did have one part that froze and I had to restart the chapter so there are still a few bugs."", 'Great just wish it would save your game without you having to complete the whole chapter. If i stop in the middle of a chapter and come back to it i have to start from the beginning of that chapter its frustrating. Other than that awesome game', ""I love this game to to to much!!!😆 I had reached upto 8 chapter I forgot to play and complete it still find it cool and so easy to play wish to have the adventure with #hirohipster in real life😉it's not possible although but trust me it's so good those graphics puzzles stories!! killer content yar!!!!!

Puzzles are challenging, but not too much. Great graphics. Fun!', 'Entertaining game, I wish more stars would appear so I could earn more hints. Often times I touch on the stars to collect them and nothing happens. Overall lots of fun.', 'I love it. There is dialogue to hel0 understand whats going on and you can find hidden stars for hints. Its really fun', 'So far, so good! When you encounter an impossible puzzle, the game-saver comes in the form of stars/hints!

Some easy puzzles & some not so easy but great to keep your brain active.', 'This is exactly the game i was looking for. Mixture of puzzles to play and an adventure story line. Awesome!', 'Nice graphics... but the items needed in the game is too small to identify...', ""Honestly, the others in this series are much better and make more sense. Maybe it could use a little revision? I've had a ton of fun with the others"", ""I LOVE the adventure escape games. Truly the best! Challenging puzzles and cut stories to match. There is no other escape game that can compare. I'm on my second time going through them....my only complaint is there are not enough."", ""Interesting. I will continue playing to be able to rate it better. So far don't have too many positive play to rate appropriately. Ok played longer & it froze. Plus it is just boring. Don't really like Haiku games. They tend to be one dimentional & some are down right creepy."", 'Love these adventure escape games. Keeps me entertained for hours. My husband even got involved helping me solve some puzzles!', ""Wow! It's awesome! But, it's way too easier than the other mystery series of Haiku escape games."", 'Interesting game so far, like the puzzles, not too hard or easy, doable with patience.', ""There's a bug in A Ship of Gold, when getting the clue to open the door with the 3 colored handles, you cannot tap the door anymore and you get stuck until you exit and enter the game. Then the parrot resets and you have to feed him again before you can give him the bottle of rum."", ""Haiku games are brilliant. Very stimulating puzzles. great to play as a family. Don't make the puzzles easier because of some reviews. People can always use the hints if they need more direction. other games are too easy."", 'Enjoyable game, challenging but reasonable in its difficulty. Would definitely like more levels!', 'Great puzzles, some more challenging than others which is good.', 'It was okay, but some of the puzzles was rather difficult and the hints can be quite unhelpfull.', ""Fun. I took over my daughter's game so had a little difficulty figuring it out. But I'm getting the hang of it and having fun."", ""Make no mistake from the 3-star review; I honestly love these games. I love puzzles that make me think and these definitely require you to use your brain, but some of these puzzles are convoluted and give you almost no way to figure them out on your own. In-game hints like to make absolutely no sense and then the optional hints eat up your stars only to give you SET hints on how to progress forward instead of a hint to get you from point C to point D. That feels cheap to me. However, those things I can deal with. Then there are the glitches. Sometimes you can't perform an action or set of actions that the game requires you to perform in order to move forward. Objects render unresponsive at random no matter how many times you tap or how thoroughly you tapped them. You wind up needing to restart the game in order to fix it, which starts you at the beginning of the level you were on. Then go back to the gameplay flaws I previously mentioned and you have a cheap, half baked mess of a game. The game can be incredibly tedious, but it's worth a good try for anyone who enjoys difficult puzzles. Regardless of these flaws, I still enjoyed my play through of it. Like I said, good game, beautiful art, interesting enough story and dialogue, but could use a little polishing."", ""Ive playes a lot of AEgames and i love the storylinea with the right amount of challenges. And no hidden costs is nice. One thing I'd suggest os adding soemthibg to make sure people want to skip a challenge as ive accidentally pressed it a few times."", 'Some challenges but easy enough to be fun if you are looking for a brain twister.']"

I'm a huge fan now!!! Thanks to the maker's of this Awesome game & Chris Ramsay for the recommendation. Cant wait for more games! Please keep them reasonably priced thou. I'm a poorbie 😊"", ""I love this game! I don't usually buy games and stick with free. But I'd read that paid games are better in game play and graphics. I was not disappointed! I love puzzles but I've found I'm so bored with the available puzzle games these days. Everyone is all about match three or hidden item. But this! This gem is a true puzzle game. I will definitely be buying the complete series! Graphics are amazing. Game play is flawless. Just love it!"", ""Brilliant, thank you! Lovely graphics, music and atmosphere. No ads, no other added costs, just good gameplay. Pricing model is spot on - create a great game, give it away and know it's good enough that people will be happy to buy future installments.

Just put the game down for 10 minutes, clear your mind, come back at a new angle. Do not forget to look at things that seem to do nothing on the surface with a way of looking under the surface.

The sounds, the graphics, the challenges, and hidden truths to alchemy. I don't normally rate games. This game deserves it. When you play you will find that you exit the earth while you absorb yourself in the gameplay. I'm convinced that the actual creator of this game has some knowledge in the dark forces of sorcery.

Graphics are a lot better than most mobile games, the plot is interesting and compelling, and the puzzles are a perfect level of challenging. The controls can be a little fiddly, but I think this is the kind of game your play if you like fiddling.

Keep up this wonderful work on', 'Hello people 👋🏻 I\'m really enjoying ""The Room: Epilogue."" I saved up Google Rewards to buy this game & I see myself purchasing more from Fireproof based on this experience. I\'m only moderately skilled in puzzling & found the game intriguing and challenging. The clue system is clever and rewards patience, frequently resulting in a gentle face palm for me. Some of the controls were not intuitive, so a minor knock there. Overall, this is a beautiful and well-executed puzzle game. Nicely done!', '""The Room"" is absolutely one of the best puzzle games ever. Albeit it has it\'s own weak spots. Amongst them is having excessive chest puzzles and less various riddles; unlike the Room two that has more liberal environment and variegated mystries. Likewise having a few levels is another problem which should be paid attention if there are going to be more spectacular puzzle games from Fireproof. Wish you a great future👍', 'The game has stunning graphics. Effort was visible throughout the game and leaves the users a good impression. It has the most challenging and creative puzzles I have seen yet. There are no bugs encountered although one major problem in the game is that the brightness keeps adjusting to low which is not suitable especially if I were to play outdoors. I would definitely buy the sequel for this. Must download for its worthy price.', ""I love this game and the three that follow after. These are the only games I have ever spent money on and would all over again. I wish I could have my memory of the game wiped just to play it over again. I still do anyways, it's so much fun and there is so much, it's easy to forget it all and redo it again with almost as much of a challenge as the first time. Hints are free, but the game makes enough sense to not need them frequently. I HIGHLY recommend this game!"", ""Such a great game. The puzzle boxes and the atmosphere are mysterious enough to keep you going. I passed on this game for years. Didn't realize I was missing out. I commend the developers. Great job!"", 'A-mazing Game literally! This game is very well made, the graphics are awesome. There is a great amount of time and detail put into this series. It is challenging and addicting.

Controls work perfectly, challenging puzzles, and you can choose to use the hints or not. Def worth it!! Played every version of ""The Room"" games and they are all top-notch!! All are 5 star games!', ""The game is great when it works, but I don't understand why it's so hard to double tap something to zoom in certain spots. Some elements have time limits and I find myself fighting just to zoom in to perform an action. And it's not now and then, it's constantly fighting just to press the correct thing over and over. I really want to like it but it's completely unplayable."", ""This game is really great! Totally worth $1 if you like puzzles and escape type games. Superb graphics. Super smooth gameplay. Somewhat short, but it's high quality. Definitely gonna go buy all the other Room games by these folks. Nicely done."", 'So far I have only completed 2 puzzles but I am hooked. Best 99 cents I have ever spent. There is a guy on YouTube who finds complex puzzles and figures out how to open them. This game is like that but virtual and I love it. The ambiance created by the music is superb!', 'Thank god this game has consistently progress saving! Spet over an hour on this game disregarding the fact my phone was dying xD But loaded it back up and right were I left off. Thank goodness. It is a fairly addictive game and worth the $1. Kept me preoccupied so far😁 Looking forward to buy their new series. Might be complicated for some but they give you plenty of clues when you are completely lost.', ""Brilliant game if you puzzle solving and mystery.

We are constantly working on improving the game so keep on commenting and rating AlphaBetty Saga after each release. Thank you for your support and Gouda luck!","[""I love it! It's a great free game for anyone who loves finding and playing around with words. You don't have to be good with words as the first level lets you find 3 letter words in different directions, and increases the word length bit by bit. I have learned so many words I didn't know existed. I haven't come across any annoying pop up ads, which is great too. Hope that a version of a Scrabble will come along in the future. Thank you so,so much, King, for creating and sharing this game."", ""I played this on my FB profile, then on my kids' profiles, and now I've started a new profile, deliberately not linking to FB because then I'd miss the fun of playing the earlier levels (before it gets hard) again. I LOVE this game. It's my favorite word game, by far."", ""it's absolutely GREAT! I love it. can't get enough! Its just totally awesome!! It has my undivided attention. I look forward to playing every day! Well, nothing has changed, it gets better every time u play. I'm still totally hooked. Just awesome!!"", 'Love this game but dont understand the day counter. What is the purpose?... I logged on earlier today and played and it rolled to day 130 something, I just logged on again to play and it rolled all the way back to 1....booooooo!!! I had the same thing happen when I first started playing and was going from level 49 to 50...it rolled all the way back to 1 even though I had logged in everyday...more boooooo!!!. Otherwise I absolutely love the challenge of this game.', 'I do enjoy this game but some of the words are truly unusual or arcane and how many times in the fill in the word games does yellow have to be the answer?', ""It's a good game but she glitches need to be addressed. On many occasions I'll be in the middle of spelling a word and before I finish it, it takes just the first part of the word before letting u finish spelling. I was trying to spell wagons but as soon as i hit the t. It took it. I've tried to do Ireland and it took the ire before I could finish. I dont lift my finger or anything. So for now I'm so pissed I'm uninstalling for now. I hate feeling cheated. I'll try again someday."", ""I love this game. I do get frustrated when the game gets ridiculously hard. I am in the higher levels and it is like you make a game you can't win until the computer feels sorry for you after three or more days of trying to win. I have just about quit playing quite a few times because of this. The cheese plates and spread the cheese are the worst and my least favorite."", 'AlphaBetty Saga is not only fun to play but it is challenging and really helps to keep my brain cells working. The game play helps to improve cognitive function and spelling while allowing you to challenge yourself against other players, who I might add are very good at this game. This game is a must-play for any word game aficionado.', ""I love this app. it's all about finding words in the letters given. at first it's easy but it becomes harder real fast. What i don't like is once they decide you're done, they end the session. I want to get 3 stars which is hard to do if they stop you too soon."", ""I like word games and this one is very challenging and fun and most if the time difficult but that's why I like it..but i have completed almost 300 levels and not once did i get a reward, prize nothing for my returns."", ""I love this game very much because it enhances vocabulary, is fun, and easy all at the same time. The gameplay is great, it never glitched and it's really a mousey adventure! My favorite word game."", 'Ibluv this game list my old game change phones oh well still great, I still feel you should add a feature to look at videos to get booster s and gold .just a thought come on people you make hard alrway it s big challenge thnx\U0001f92f', 'I love this game! But...the word rounds are extremely difficult sometimes. If you have a educational limitations then trying to find 7 letter words is hard. Also, you ask for too much money for bars.', 'Good blend of word making and puzzle solving. Decent dictionary, too.', 'Brilliant word game. One of the best. Well done. It would be more fun if bonuses were given for gold bars rather than having to buy them. I realise you need to make money but on the odd occasion it would be a nice incentive! Still think it is one of the best word games!', 'There are not many differences among the levels. Candy Saga or Sida saga are more fun.', 'I like the challenge of the game and that each screen is more difficult than the last for the most part. The only thing that makes me batty is they will lone up ALL the letters you need for a long word....except ONE.', 'This game is very good exercise for your brain with having to constantly think of words that test your spelling with adding challenging objectives to complete too. Any game that helps get your brain get sharper is a great game and everyone should play games like this.', 'Sadly, this last update does not add up all the lighted letters, after I complete each game. Meaning, I am cheated out of points I should\'ve recieved. Why have an ""Update"", to this game, when there was nothing wrong? I would give you ""Zero Stars"", if I could. I only play this and another game, & you ruined the challenge to try & score 3 Stars each time, because now it is impossible, without the points that should\'ve been counted You have cheated us points, that we should\'ve. received Thank you', 'I am encountering words I have never seen before and having words rejected that are frequently used daily. Seems peculiar! Would appreciate the rules and options available to play the game. That would enhance my experience. XXXX Ditto!', 'Great game. Gets much more difficult the further you go. Excellent.', ""The game is good, but the fact that they offer no incentives except passing levels not even able to earn power ups, I can only give it a two star rating. I'm almost in the 300s and have won nothing."", 'Takes a long time to get to the really challenging levels, but very much worth it. Could be a better GUI for selecting mouse bonus helpers.', 'It can be really challenging. Difficult at times. Tests your mind. My kind of game! No crashes. No issues, except for my brain. Lol Good game. Highly recommended', 'Love this game, only problem is I play every day for the last few years (yes, I am Boring) and it drops my days played- needs to be on a 24 hour game play time! Love it, keeps my mind active!!!🤗', 'I think its a great game to play when ur alittle board or you just want to relax but its very easy + no mattter how far you get level wise it doesnt get any harder or test you much. Its for very young kids. Not a game for adults really unless you have learning difficultys.', 'love the challenges, but need ways to earn helps. as far as I can tell they must be bought. anyone know how to get them just by playing, let me know. It does get difficult, but when you beat a harder level WOW if feels good.', 'This is a great game. It really makes you think. But what is best is I can take my time and not feel pressured. So many other games create a sort of anxiety because of the timed factor.', ""It's fun! Moves right along.....and so Far lets me move on without getting stuck forever. Okay... I'm getting stuck now and then...,..but can't quit trying....over and over!!!! I think I'm hooked! Very challenging game!"", ""One of the top 5 games I've tried like this that I actually like and find fun to play...plus it's a great time killer. Definitely recommend. ☺️"", 'Love playing the game. Rewards should be better, especially when completing a difficult game. Thats why I rated this app a 4.', 'My favorite word game, never boring because it switches the challenges around every few puzzles so you never know what you will be doing on the next puzzle .', 'I have been playing years now, and have been quiet content with it... Until now. I notice that the free scramble /shuffle is now gone! You have to purchase it and I am not interest at all!', ""Fast-paced, yet fairly engaging. Not as difficult as I prefer but hopefully as I advance through levels the challenge will increase. I'm entertained."", ""It let's you go so far, then freezes, and you can't play any more levels. I could only play to level 64. It seems you corrected the problem."", 'Very very enjoyable. Excellent one. Like to play more.', 'Alpha betty is a game that comparing with the rest if i were its truely beneficial to the mind as it challenges you to not only break your own records, from time to time, but mentally keep you conditioned and mentally active...', 'Great game but wish more levels were introduced. I reached 920 a year ago and am still waiting to progress.! Other than that Alphabetty is a fantastic word/puzzle game if you like being challenged.', ""Lots of fun to play! Helps keep my mind a little sharper. Heck!!!! I'm tarp as a shack! I mean sharp as a tack!

It's been really long since i have this game installed in my devices like more than 6 years. I changed my device 2 time during this and i have to start over again. But now i am really so far in progress and don't want to lose it. Requesting you to add an option to backup the progress and I'll change my rating to 5 star immediately."", ""I just love this game. Have been playing it for years. But there's a problem with it that is really annoying; there is no backup or syncing feature to save my data. Every time I buy a new cell and move my apps and other stuff to the new phone I have to reinstall and start over. This's very disappointing :("", ""Good game but can I suggest when you do the monthly game can you do the rewards to match the number of days in that month. Example February has 29 days this year but yet there won't be enough to complete the whole 31 day puzzle game. It's frustrating for me as a person I don't know if anyone feels this way or is it just me"", ""This is a whole lot different from the other words apps that I'm use to playing, but this the reason I chose it. The ads are a bit annoying and some of the pictures get frustrating to figure out but all in all it's an okay game because I'm not known to easily quit and none have broken me yet, but I'm getting addicted already and love a good challenge!!"", ""There must have been a glitch of some kind or not redownloading correctly as nothing worked as it did before as I've been playing this for a long time. Pleased to say everything came right and I love this game. I play it every day and update it somtimes to get more pics. There are plenty of hard words to tax your brain and make it a challenge. I recommend it."", ""Very interested game it helps to widen my vocabulary and keep my brain active. However the only problem I have is, if the game has been uninstalled for any reason you can't go back to the same level you were at, you would have to start all over from stage one. There should be a way to connect to FB to save your progress so if the game is uninstalled for any reason you can always go back to the same level instead of starting all over."", 'its a very nice game it keeps the brain learning new things and having fun. The issue is you guys have not introduced a way for someone not to loose their progress. i have restarted this game four times now. the last time i was almost level 1000 and thats why i gave you 2stars. i would have given four but what for. do something bout that', 'This is a good game except for the ads.

Instead of playing some other game v can play this game. This very useful for children . This help to increase mental power.first u may think its easy but after going 20 levels u feel tough to solve it. I suggest that everyone can download this game. I lov this game very much.', ""It's very easy to use and play. It's a very interesting game. It allows u to ransack ur brain for words possible and in a way increases vocabulary of a person. Keep up the good work"", 'I enjoy playing the game and I would have given it 5 stars but I recently got a new phone and unfortunately I had to start the game from square one. I sent a message and asked why I had to start over. I was given a work around but I wished the game would have synced up with my new phone like my other games did.', ""It's a fun puzzle game. Keeps your mind going. I've played it many times. This like my 4th time playing it. I've completed it twice. One of my favorite puzzle games. Just make four pics together into one word. One pic throws the word off sometimes. Have fun and enjoy!"", ""It is a fun game but if you go out of the app it will automatically assume that you don't know what the word is. It's kind of annoying that it just gives you letters when you probably wanted to text someone or take a break. If that wasn't there I would give five stars."", ""I love the game, but an ad after every 3 picrtures is just too much! It breaks the rhythm of the game play and it's annoying. I am uninstalling this game because of all the ad interruptions."", ""It's a nice little puzzle type game. And it would be fun if they didn't throw 2 ads at you after every three puzzles. I understand that free games need ads to make money, but this frequently is ridiculous!"", 'I had this on my old phone and loved playing it. I just downloaded it for this phone and am beyond annoyed by the number of ads. I just might be uninstalling it. It feels like there is an ad for every puzzle.', ""TOO MANY ADS! Got to level 10, no ads. After level 10, you can't play any level after that without watching a 30 second ad first. Extremely annoying! And makes the game unenjoyable. Uninstalling. Great game otherwise."", ""Very nice and entertaining game.. Could keep you entertained for hours...One thing I don't like is that it cannot retain your progress. I reached a very high level in the game.. Changing the phone made me start from scratch...."", ""Love it. Gets the brain working. Playing it on 2 phones as couldn't transfer game to new phone. I have been playing it for a while. 51356 is score on old phone. Waiting for more games, playing daily puzzles until then."", ""I understand that games that are free come with ads but the level of intrusive ads in this app is insane. You can pay to get rid of them of course but in my opinion with all the other games out there that you can enjoy for free this game isn't really worth spending the money on."", ""I love this game... But the ads are gonna cause me to uninstall it! The Yahtzee ad came up and there's nowhere to x it out... Everytime I touch it, it takes me to my play store... I'm so ready to quit playing if the ads are going to be like this."", 'I love the game as it actually challenges my brain but as of late the only time I can see the daily puzzle pictures is if I have wifi not mad about it but is this something anyone else is have issues with?', 'When i play online, the adds just keep disturbing. The additional 4 point given when u win a stage is very small compared to the point taken from you for a single lettet hint (-60 point). Tho, i like it. It is a mind game.', 'Too easy. I played years back and it was a challange. Now its boring its so easy i got to level 53 in about 35 minutes. Im so bored with because its so easy im already gona delete and never try again.

Need to make an advanced version!"", 'I like it very much it is so challenging game. This helps in making strong brain power and I you can learn so much by this game. You can guess the problem so easily It is my favourite game...', 'Very fulfilling. It helps to u burden my mind and makes me realise l have a lot of words in my repertoire. Some of the pictures do not necessarily match.', 'Evidently the publishers have worked out by making the puzzles ridiculously easy they get more ad revenue. I just blew through 50 puzzles only looking at 1 pic. Way easier than it used to be, just boring now', ""Best game ever!!! This is very entertaining and keeps your mind occupied. This is a good way to keep you smart.(in a good way). Awesome game and back off haters!! Don't make me get my hater spray.... Thx developer for making this amazing games!!"", ""I would give lower if I could. Every 3 levels is an ad, it's making it very off putting to keep playing. Im considering uninstalling it because of all the ads. If you have ads have them every 20 levels or so not every 3!!"", ""You can't save progress when changing your phone. I've gone far now I have to start over on another phone. Bad game. It's not hard to do. Google play games is enough to save progress in my account"", ""Super cool, but don't like the idea of playing the game with my data. Not funny please. Especially the daily puzzle part, its annoying pls change it, or is it qrong for one to update it? Too bad!"", 'If you are planning to get this app, you better think twice. Ads are annoying. It pops up every time you complete a level. This is just a waste of time. Instead of you getting fun, it will make you throw youre phone.', ""I truly enjoy the brain tease of this game, I CAN'T STAND that ads pop up after just 3 puzzles, after EVERY 3 puzzles. That's too frequent for me - I'm about to quit the game all together because of it."", 'Ads more than a game. This game used to be good, but now there is WAY too many ads, and they are locked to a certain amount of time as well, so you spend more time ignoring ads than actually playing the game.', ""I would give it 5 stars coz it's a awesome game but ads after one puzzle takes that one star, it's just a knock out uuf!!,,.aside from ads am game"", ""Nice game, but really annoying to deal with 30+ second interactive ads (which then go to a static ad that can't be dismissed for five more seconds) as frequently as every 3 puzzles"", 'Great game, I gave it a 4 out of 5 stars because of the ads , there are to many of ads ......', 'Too many ads. 15 second ads are too long. 30 second ads are intolerable!! Otherwise good educational app. Should devise gameboy style device and distribute to schools for spelling, thinking, problem solving.', ""Every time i click the play button why does it not play?

     - Remaining number of words (the number of words to find earrings shown)

4.- Has two methods of self-generation:

All you have to do is search for a word, and when you find one, mark it with the finger from the first letter to the last. By doing so, if the word is correct it will be marked with a distinctive color and you'll can search the next

The palindrome words, that is, which is also read from right to left and left to right, starting can be labeled either ends.

NOTE: Sometimes are generated at random, unexpected words; especially if they are very short (2 or 3 letters); on these occasions, if the word appears in the dictionary of the topic, when you mark the word, this is added to the list of words and is marked with a distinctive colour.


SCORE

Complete the game, calculates your score and stores your best times.


INFINITE GAME

Also, if you can not finish the game, do not worry, when you get back can choose to start a new game or continue the game as you left it.

The puzzles get super challenging, and the game continuously integrates new puzzle mechanics as you progress, keeping it fresh (but not confusing)."", ""I've also played hitman go but I think this is better. It's the perfect game to play for a few minutes, but it can also capture you for longer. I picked it up for a quid and think it's great for that, much better than having to put up with ads or in app purchases."", ""It's the best and only game i think in adve-puzle genre. Varied levels of mind bogglness. Only thing is that i think game is unfinished, due to the whole story line in the background of the game misses a few levels. All else is a wonderful experience."", ""Outstanding. With cloud save and vertical movement. One of the best among go series. Relics and collectible makes us play levels again. Only skin and solutions are the iap. This game made me feel nostalgic of the lara croft games I've played during old times. I would recommend this to all Lara croft and go series fans."", ""One of the best android games I have played well worth the money. Wish more games were just a one off price and you get the full game no limits no adverts too many pay wall games these days. Just completed it. The worsed part of the game is knowing I don't have anymore levels to play :("", 'This is an exceptional game in all levels. One of the rare jewels in mobile gaming. Puzzle platformer with turns at its best form. Also nothing to purchase in game. Just hit play. Wish I could give more stars.', ""It's awsome. The simple graphics, soundtrack, and movement/environment sounds makes it have a nostalgic and modern feel to it."", 'Well biggest disoppointment for me is that , this game does not even connect to play store and my connection is even good and after that i had to just click back soft key to skip that part ot logging in and play the game , Device Redmi K20 Pro android 10 game scks st this part , well other than that game is good.', 'Nice gameplay and graphics. The puzzles are great. What annoying is , is that two level they keep asking to rate the game. For that I give it 1 star less than what I wanted to give.', 'This is such a great puzzle game. I wish they would make more adventures so that I can keep playing it much longer.', ""So far so good! The game isn't quite your classic tomb raider but it's stayed true to the genre in how the game feels and Lara acts. The puzzles are progressive and achievable and the movement is great. A couple of times I've been let down by dodgy controls but on the whole, very impressed!"", 'Really amazing game. Gorgeous, clever, and well-adapted for mobile. Square Enix is becoming one of the best Android/iOS devs. And they can take my money.', 'Lara has guns, but will only shoot things from point blank. Find a spear and she yeet it from any distance to get a kill. You\'re better off buying this for a full computer than a smart phone. Some ""hidden"" vases are completely obscured, so find a guide. Even then the skins aren\'t worth the effort. Some nice puzzles though...', ""Loved every level! Way worth the price. Especially if you're a fan! Highly recommend. The collectibles aren't too tough to find, and the puzzles were the perfect difficulty. The AHA factor is great. Would love to play more! Going to look into the other GO titles. But I'm gonna miss Lara"", 'The puzzles are amazing. The game is just perfect to relax and rest a while while on the train or just laying in bed. Amazing colour palette and environments.', 'Simple, but deep. Feels a lot like other TR games, despite the difference in gameplay', 'I like fun, relaxing games like this where the levels take a minute or two. So far the puzzles are fun, but not frustrating.', 'Fun and challenging puzzles. Beautiful and clear graphics and I love the atmosphere music. Overall, a very well made game.', ""Good puzzles and nice graphics. The gameplay is easy to pick up and there are a fair amount of things to unlock and discover. If you're a tomb raider fan, it's an easy buy."", 'Probably my favorite of the Squenix GO! games. The graphics are gorgeous yet simple-looking. The puzzles are challenging enough to feel like you outsmarted them, but not too frustrating. The animations are great and remind me of old school flashier Lara.', ""I loved Deus Ex and Hitman GO. I didn't even have to play this game in order to give it a 5 star. I'm pretty sure I'll get high quality and good Gameplay. You can't go wrong with the GO series."", 'The amazing graphics and fantastic soundtrack make the immersion simply impossible to describe! Nice gameplay and easy swipe and touch controls make the game even better!', 'Great Game!! The gameplay and visuals are amazing and the puzzles are interesting!', 'Fantastic game. It just does everything so superbly. Stunning artistic style, great puzzles. The controls are silky smooth on android.', 'Great game. Feels like old Lora. Puzzles are fun and a calming challenge', ""Good puzzles and it's what I wanted. I've had it for over a year and still enjoy this game."", 'Decent puzzle game. What really is annoying though is that it disables any music app even if you turn off sounds in the game settings.', 'Really enjoyed playing this game, not had any problem or ads. I give it a big 5 stars', 'Very nice graphics, moderately difficult, the extra adventures are more challenging. Recommendable.', ""This game is great! It's got good graphics, cool puzzles, and overall good mechanics."", 'Fantastic game, really great value for money. Lots of levels and such a beautiful well designed game.', 'All the fun of Tomb Raider without the stress of trying to remember which of 12 buttons does what you need.', ""This is the first mobile game i've bought in years. Its nearly perfect. The only things i'm not a fan of are a couple of the animations and the fact that Lara doesn't smoothly rotate when moving. this isn't anything major, though, so i can't complain much. As a fan of the francise i would've liked more graphical violence, but this is a mobile game, so i understand the decision to not do that. Anyhow, i highly recommend this to just about anyone. I wish i could work on games like this!"", 'This is probably one of the most enjoyable time i had playing a mobile game in a long time. Controls are good and graphics are beautiful. Kudos to the developer for making this amazing game.', 'The rate at which the difficulty of the puzzles are ramping up as you play is just perfect. The visuals are great, I really liked the pastel colors, they give a unique atmosphere to the game.', ""This is what a good mobile game is. You can't play as many types of games as on a computer or a console mostly because of the input limitations. Just like you can't play an fps on a mobile phone. This point is one of the thing that makes it earn 5 star because it is playable everywhere, without special requiring too much finger dexterity. The second is the quality of the story telling. It's simple yet effective and really good looking. Same for graphics and sound. Just like a real PC game."", ""I'm a logic puzzle fan, so this is my FAVORITE type of game, discovered Tomb Raider when my husband found an old PS1 back in '03. Been playing every version of TR ever since! This is the best substitute when I can't access my console! 👍🏻""]"

Sounds and music fit perfectly. The detailing and camera direction at the start of levels is such a nice touch that it makes it masterpiece in my opinion. The opening scene of Lv 3-12 is my personal favorite. The game is so simple aesthetically but detailed as well, it's a refreshing offline game with no pay to play mechanics at all. Needed to use only 3/5 free hints to get all 27 achievements, which are good in that they don't need you to grind. A 10/10."", 'Got this game on sale for $0.99, but I feel that it would have been worth it even at the full asking price. The mechanics are very simple, but the puzzles are complex enough to keep you interested. And for the completionists out there - each level has different challenges, such as no kills, kill everyone, maximum number of moves, retrieve a briefcase to bring to the the exit, etc.', ""I have mixed feelings about this game. I really like the concept of this 'GO' type of games. It's simple and intuitive....However the glitches really bug me especially when during the transition of camera's perspective! Don't get me wrong, the graphic is amazing, but the glitches really put me off... I decided to uninstall the game.... :("", ""This a solid and attractive puzzle game that is occasionally challenging. It has one serious flaw which is why I gave it 4/5: On most stages, it's deliberately impossible to get all 3 objectives at the same time. This is deeply unsatisfying and means you beat the level and then have to do it again - usually without any significant additional challenge - to get the last objective."", 'This is one of the best casual mobile game which I have played. This has a board game type feel yet it packs so much enjoyment and gameplay experience in it that I really want to play more of this even after finishing the game. I have given it 4 stars because the game is relatively short and in the end you really wish for more of gameplay or new levels.', ""Love the boardgame plastic pieces effect, fits so well with the hitman asthetic making it seem like a 50's style game but out of time. Puzzles are pretty hard but fun and eventually doable as you have that eureka moment. Only issue was cant sign in to google play for achievements or cloud save. If I wanted to uninstall to play at a later date I would always be starting over. Love games with movements as the puzzle, its simple but complicated as more mechanics throw in. That makes them so great!"", ""A nice puzzle game. The only thing I don't like is that you can't clear save data. The button is there, but as soon as you clear a level, it will have shown all the levels cleared."", 'I love the game. It was challenging, but I managed to finish all the puzzles and got all the achievements. Wish there would be more. Love the game.', ""Hitman Go is an amazing app. For only 99 cents, you get tons of challenging, almost impossible levels that can be completed in multiple ways. This is a board game version of hitman, so don't expect to shoot people and hide bodies. The visuals are very appealing and I often found myself pondering on how to complete a certain objective on a level."", 'As a long time fan of the Hitman series, I\'m actually impressed with this game. I remember thinking ""what the hell is this?"" when I first saw gameplay. But I\'m glad I actually bought it whilst it was on sale. Really challenging gameplay with recognisable mechanics from the triple A titles, just on a table top themed setting. If you\'re a fan of the Hitman series, or just a fan of the stealth action genre in general, definitely give this a go.', 'Fantastic. In my opinion, the sounds (music and sound effects), the artwork, the variety of enemy types and items, the number of levels and level packs, and so many more features combine to make this incredible masterpiece. You can definitely see the love that was put into the creation, what a wonderful experience it was to play this and I am upset that it is over. If you have not tried this, I recommend you consider it. I have not played the standard hitman series, but I reckon I now should.', ""If there were any word better than 'best', that could describe it. It probably the bestest logical game ever made. Outstanding!"", 'Greatest puzzle game!!! It made me think outside the box in a whole new way!!! I would totally recommend!!! The soundtrack is totally intuitive and it gets your mind into a relaxed zone. This game is perfect to sharpen your brain and help pass the time if on a trip or break. This is the best puzzle game i have ever played hands down.', ""Decent puzzle game. I picked it up after completing Tomb Raider Go which is a superb game. I recommend playing that first, and this one if you can't get enough of that style."", 'Good, challenging, worth the dollar and half I spent on it considering the multitude of levels it contains, the music also puts well in the ambiance. Being a huge fan of the series, I totally recommend it.', ""It's a very fun game it keeps me engaged and interested and it helps the time go by when I should be working and helps block out the pain from my brother doing heroin"", 'Should make for a good game to pass the time waiting for the bus. And while on the bus. And when i get home. Basically all the time. Wish there was a directional pad for moving instead of having to stretch my thumbs across the screen, especially when the controls are so simple. Still a good game though, worth the pound.', 'I think this game got something to do with it. should adding more weapons, object interaction, give more than 10 ways to do assasinating in every single chapter, sound effects, soundtrack background. (If they do add and fix it people who playing this will excite it) ""this is my idea considered to improving the game with my an opinion only""', 'Best game I have ever played. I was big fan of this game on my PC but recently I have started playing it on my android and trust me you will love this game, especially its background music. This game really helps me increase my concentration and relaxing my mind. You will experience Dopamine level boosted in your body.', 'Great little strategy game. Keeps your gears turning and requires you to think. The music and ambience are very relaxing as well, and the game has very charming art within.', ""I've loved the Hitman series from the beginning. I also love board games and puzzles. This just meshed it all perfectly."", 'Great puzzle board game from a beloved franchise. Good game definitely worth the try.', ""I played Lara Croft Go first and needed a fix of more puzzle. Only gripe is that the camera doesn't always cooperate with showing the best view of the board. But otherwise a great little puzzle game with a nice, distinctive aesthetic."", 'Very nice departure that still in many ways stays true to franchise. This was a very welcomed fresh take on one of the best game franchises ever conceived.', ""It's ok. Gameplay is rather boring, and there are a few bugs. Every time to start playing it automatically takes you to the next chapter even if you haven't finished the previous one. It's also really not difficult enough."", ""This mobile puzzle game is really fun to play. I'm a fan of the HITMAN games & this is another great one. 👍"", 'Just as pretty as Lara Croft GO, brilliant board game aesthetic, and legitimately challenging. Never can delete this one.', ""Yay: Excellent and gorgeous setup, making it look and feel like you're playing an actual board game. Really makes you think ahead to solve the puzzles. Great way to pass the time. Nay: Nothing much, except maybe that this will most likely not become a real board game you can touch, feel, and own. Final Say: A great, quirky addition to the Hitman series. Worth the price you pay for it, whether you're a fan of the series, or just puzzle games in general."", 'Pretty good - plenty of thinking to get through the levels - Lara Go is better, more recent - and better action and movement- I am now re-playing Lara - but this one is definitely interesting enough to play through', 'Possibly the best in the Go! series, Hitman is a brainy puzzle game in which you move your character like a chess piece, trying to traverse a level withoit being seen by enemies. The graphics are very impressive, with strong art & effects. Due to its nature, the game is perfect in short bursts. Most importantly, the Hitman concepts are very cleverly translated into the Go! design, making for a fun, consistent & intelligent game. Strongly recommended as one of the better games on a mobile phone!!', 'Great UI and puzzles. Was always a fan of Hitman and this just makes it better.', ""Lara Croft GO is way better. This game has no animations or story to accompany the puzzles, so you literally just move a Hitman piece around on a digital board game, level after level. The camera mostly stays overhead. The puzzles are fascinating, with snipers, teleportation, etc., though I have to say I enjoyed the aesthetic of Lara Croft GO a lot more and the relics you can find. The difficulty seems the same in both games. Anyway, this game isn't bad, but not as good as Lara Croft GO."", ""Ok. Is this checkers??? I was expecting to be like Lara Croft with some animation to it. I didn't like it. I'm out of this"", ""No in-app purchases that are basically necessary (you can buy hints but... it's a strategy game. So of course you can get by just don't without buying hints.), tons of levels and fantastic gameplay. I just wish they would add even more levels or release a sequel. Oh and two annoying UI things: There is no counter telling you which turn it is. Which makes extra goals with maximum turns annoying. Also, it's a pain to figure out which levels you haven't 100%ed yet."", 'Great game. Captures the essence of hitman perfectly.', ""Worth the money. It has almost nothing to do with the actual hitman game but this doesn't make this game bad. Levels are very challenging and really makes you think about how to complete the challenges. The only issue is that you can never complete all challenges in a perfect run, sometimes you can but for most levels there is a perfect run for each challenge individually."", ""I didn't know what to expect from this game, considering it's a mobile Hitman game, which is a series I'm unfamiliar with. But man, this is a well designed puzzle Hitman game. I only know the series from YouTube videos I've seen, but this seems to be faithful to the source material, given that you want a much simpler version of Hitman. For $0.99, this is a pretty great game. I would say it's worth your money. Once I finish it, it's likely I'll check out the other GO games from Square Enix."", ""It's unlike any other game with a beautiful interface and style. The set pieces are charming and the gameplay is challenging and fun. I'm really enjoying the experience"", ""Good game, but not as good as Lara Croft Go. It's worth picking up on sale."", ""Really good take on a mobile hitman game, perfect for picking up and leaving as all mobile games should be, perfect difficulty curve teaching you the basics and then dropping you in on a bit of a thinker. Great puzzle game even you if you're not into the hitman games, Highly recommend.. possibly do a lite version with less levels to give people a chance to see what it's like?""]"

The deeper into the game i got the more out of sync the hits got to the actual puzzles. For instance In the both the two consecutive numbers and coloured gears puzzles, the hint told me to pick up a plank! Also I found that the hint skip and back buttons were too close and accidentally wasted points by hitting the skip on several occasions. Other than that I LOVE THE GAMES', ""Is this really can be played in just 2 days? Or did I miss anything? The game is easy n quite relaxing, no rushing. It can be played without using real money. Love this kind of game. Wish the story can be longer so it's more interesting. I think I'll try their other games too"", 'The game is quite good but some parts are hard to understand.

I took over my daughter's game so had a little difficulty figuring it out. But I'm getting the hang of it and having fun."", ""Make no mistake from the 3-star review; I honestly love these games. I love puzzles that make me think and these definitely require you to use your brain, but some of these puzzles are convoluted and give you almost no way to figure them out on your own. In-game hints like to make absolutely no sense and then the optional hints eat up your stars only to give you SET hints on how to progress forward instead of a hint to get you from point C to point D. That feels cheap to me. However, those things I can deal with. Then there are the glitches. Sometimes you can't perform an action or set of actions that the game requires you to perform in order to move forward. Objects render unresponsive at random no matter how many times you tap or how thoroughly you tapped them. You wind up needing to restart the game in order to fix it, which starts you at the beginning of the level you were on. Then go back to the gameplay flaws I previously mentioned and you have a cheap, half baked mess of a game. The game can be incredibly tedious, but it's worth a good try for anyone who enjoys difficult puzzles. Regardless of these flaws, I still enjoyed my play through of it. Like I said, good game, beautiful art, interesting enough story and dialogue, but could use a little polishing."", ""Ive playes a lot of AEgames and i love the storylinea with the right amount of challenges. And no hidden costs is nice. One thing I'd suggest os adding soemthibg to make sure people want to skip a challenge as ive accidentally pressed it a few times."", 'Some challenges but easy enough to be fun if you are looking for a brain twister.']"

Its just very short. For 5 quid on a mobile device, I'd want more from it. The design of the features are detailed and inspiring. But I'm just going to harp on about how small it is. In context, a fiver on a game is quite a considerable amount. And the game is only a couple hrs long. More content please. Having said that I'm going to buy the next one."", ""This game was great until you got to the room with the typewriter and safe. The touch sensitivity doesn't work the way it should. On my phone, when you touch the typewriter or safe, it sound uncontrollably and you can't get to the letters as they spin out of control. Googled troubleshooting and nothing worked. Also seems to be a known issue. Hoping it's resolved soon."", 'Has been very much fun and makes you think, I am looking forward to #3 and #4 ""Old Sins"". I hope more will come after that. Any game that makes you use you brain is a good game as far as I am concerned. But these go beyond that by making the game look and feel like you just find it hard to put down and take a break. That is one sign of a very well made game.', ""So far, I've played 3 of the series. Started with the newest. But go in order. Just better. Not really a spoiler playing newest 1st, but you figure out the null quicker. On to #3 of the series. It will be sad finishing the series.. WELL worth the tiny price to pay. Hours of fun for the price of a beer. Make a 5th!!!!!!"", ""After the third try get the game to function, I finally could enjoy it. Some of the puzzles are almost too simple, but some are challenging and even delightful! So I changed my 1-star rating (when there was no way I could play) to 4-star. It seems that there are problems with the download and if you encounter any problems, just uninstall and try again. Without this issue, and because of the simplicity of some puzzles, it's not a 5-star."", ""This game is wonderful! Graphics are beautiful, story is captivating. The controls are somewhat annoying because of how often you have to zoom in and then back out but it's a very minor annoyance. This game is worth the money, each volume (whole game)takes roughly 4-5 hours to fully complete while each chapter can take 1 to 2 hours depending how good you are. Hopefully the third instalment is just as good as the first 2!"", ""I never pay for apps but the room games will always be an exception. Soooo amazing and super satisfying. Accomplishments much more rewarding when completed with hints disabled. I'm a big fan off puzzle boxes and logic games so as well as entertainment this game provides me with inspiration, as I'm attempting to make one of my own. Way to gooooooo Fireproof games!"", ""I have ended up play the room 2 out of sequence but having said that it doesn't seem to matter. I thoroughly enjoyed this game and it made the old (65yr old) grey cells work hard. I am off to play the others now. Keep up the good work. I recommend this game to anyone who wants a challenge."", ""Awesome graphics! Game overall is very good! Nice brain teasers! If it wasn't for some hints it would have taken much longer! (It took me few days to finish it) very nice though, looking forward to play the next one! ;) Hope we will have many more to come :)"", ""Brilliant, my only gripe is it didn't go longer! This series of games are by far the Best mobile games I've ever played! Please keep them under $5 . I definitely wouldn't have tried them if the 1st one wasn't so cheap! Worth every cent! PLEASE make more of these games!!!"", ""Touch sensitivity is out of order. I have no problems placing/interacting with most objects on my Pixel 4XL but anything that requires precision (e.g. dials, typewriters, etc.) is absolutely appalling. When I touch those things they would spin like crazy. This was the same with the first game but didn't affect me much. I'm now doing the chapter with the typewriter and I can't complete it because there is no way for me to type the words that are required because I cannot select the letters..."", ""Excellent game! Makes you think hard in order to find solutions. Please develop more, I would indeed purchase them. Who ever thought these games up has a high intelligence. Edit I've just played this game a second time, the last time some months ago. Its surprising how much one forgets the solutions. Thoroughly enjoyed it again. Time to purchase Room 3. Again thank you, it been a while since I played something that uses ones brain as opposed to the boring match 3 games that simply numb the brain"", ""Great, if occasionally infuriating, game! Really expands on the concept of the original Room with greatly expanded puzzles. Unlike before, the puzzles aren't simply with one item, but multiples areas in a setting. The controls are a little frustrating sometimes, yet not enough to take too much away from the experience. All in all really enjoyed playing, and completing, this game over the past ~3 hours and am looking forward to the next one!"", ""Chapter 4 (poker room) is glitchy. The clues (used all 4 in hopes it would let me skip) only tell me what I already know. Need to enter passcode to open the safe. But the dial constantly spins and resets. No way to go beyond this point. Google won't give refund. Had similar issue with typewrite (as someone else mentioned) but not as bad (was still able to complete task). Tried uninstalling/reinstalling. Didn't help. Deleted. Now wary of the other games in this series."", ""A fantastic occult-y puzzle/escape room game. This installment does a good job of fleshing out the plot from the first game, and is a great set up for the third. It can be more intense than the first one (I don't usually like things that get scary, though it's more thriller than horror), and I like how it explores different settings while remaining cohesive. Really amazing, especially for a phone game."", 'Challenging and lengthy puzzles that are well thought and keep you guessing. The game is well polished and looks and sounds great. Some puzzles are simply lengthy because it can take a while to find the switch or lever, others I found highly rewarding for persevering and getting through.', ""Absolutely loved how beautiful this game is. Played on One Plus 6t. When I thought I found a bug in some instances, it was actually part of the puzzle, and when reading some of the 1 star reviews, it looks like they might have had the same. Game play is fluent. Story line was absolutely unclear, could not follow at all, but I don't really care about that. Loved it, will play all fireproof room games."", ""I played the first on PC just recently and learned these were available on mobile. This plays very well! There were times I wished I had a bigger screen, and the drawer in the last level was really finicky. I can't wait to play the other two!"", ""Great game, but as many others have said, the touch controls are all out of whack. I played fine up until the Tarot card room with the safe dial. Can't spin the dial to lock in the correct letters, making the puzzle impossible to complete."", 'Not sure yet what to think! Loved the first one but the second one, on the ship I can not seem to get back to the treasure chest where the hint tells me to go. This seems like a big issue to me ! May try to restart the level ( though I would rather not ) and go from there ! If not, I want a refund for part 2 and 3 because I also purchased part 3. Will update review if I can connect again to the game. The original part one was OUTSTANDING!! Bravo to Devs!! Well thought out and executed. So we sha', ""Honestly, this game is just FANTASTIC! It is EPIC, FASCINATING, confusing as HECK sometimes (both puzzles and storyline), super mysterious and convoluted, and not just a little creepy (but that's part of the fun!😆) However, if you have kids who are sensitive to that, you might want to wait until they're older to try and play it. Of course, the best option would probably be to have you or their parents or guardians try it out first and then gauge it to see if this is something they can handle."", ""I loved the game but some controls were hypersensitive, making some parts more difficult than necessary, but it was more of an annoyance than anything. It didnt detract from the fun of the game at all! It's too bad there isn't a free version. I would not mind watching ads for a game this good."", ""It makes you think use your brain you think is gonna go one way and then the whole situation changes on you that's what our real game suppose to do it keeps you in suspense like you're suspended in air with out the noose tied around your neck The game is wonderful top notch don't look at the measly 2 or $3 I guarantee you the money is well worth it"", 'I highly enjoyed my time playing this game. This is the first of the series I started with and I can\'t wait to dive into the rest. Every puzzle I solved almost on my own but the times I did need a hint always gave me an ""OH. RIGHT. THAT"" feeling. Shaved off a good 3-4 hours off my flight too so that\'s a plus', 'An Excellent game and well worth the price. Exceptional graphics, gameplay is just as challenging as it needs to be, No annoying ads to distract you from the game. Will definitely purchase/play the next installment.', ""Not over hyping when I say it was awesome, challenging, beautiful, scary, tense and absolutely worth the price. I had to catch my breath sometimes (especially at the end) because I got so into the setting. The 'hint' feature works great, not revealing too much at a time."", 'The Room games have spoiled me. Now it seems most games are juvenile or boreing. I have all four of the games and completed two of them. It doesnt get any better.These games have captured my imagination like no others. Hey Creators more we want more...', 'Wow.. the puzzles are creative and challenging but not too difficult to the point of irritation. The graphics and cinematics are on point, and the storyline is quite interesting. Well done folks, TR 1 and TR 2 are the only games I have ever paid for and I think I have to get TR 3 now', 'Game is designed well an enjoyable, except for some game breaking bugs. Scrolling the typewriter is basically hypersensitive and getting to individual letters deliberately was horrible, but I got through it everytime. The hidden safe later is impossible and impassible. Hoping for a bug fix in the future, but without it, I bought a broken game.', ""I love everything about this game except their buggy controls. It was manageable in the beginning until the infamous taro card room when you try to turn the dial. Why isn't there a fix for this when everyone is experiencing this?!"", 'Really brilliant game. Beautiful, sumptuous graphics and a creepy atmospheres combine with puzzle solving that REALLY makes use of touch screen controls. It\'s short, yes, but think of the whole ""The Room"" series as a single game divided into chapters to make each of them mobile game priced. And there\'s no currency, boo microtransactions, no DLC - just a beautiful, Myst style puzzle game of clockwork boxes and intricate models', ""One of the best puzzle games I have found. The cost of the game is well worth the value. I much rather buy editions of The Room than all the in ap purchase other games make you use. It's like being in a multiple layered escape room with just a little creepy factor. Not sure there is really a plot, just good puzzles, but possibly the cryptic notes will make sense when I progress."", ""Absolutely one of thr best games I've played! The music was intense, the graphics were realistic and the puzzles were brilliant! I did not want the game to end. I've purchased The Room One. Two and Three. I look forward to many more. I had zero technical difficulties. Amazing game! Thank you!"", ""Only criticism is the boat level was a joke and shouldn't even be considered a level. Also, wish the game was a little longer. Completed it in 4 hours which isn't that long considering it's pay 2 play."", ""This is a really good game series. I normally don't buy games on the market but I am more then willing to drop the 1 or 2 dollars per game. This are fun and each one is better than the last. I'm going to go buy number 3 now."", 'Absolutely love these games bought the first one and played it then bought all 3 remaining at once so I could play them uninterrupted. My 14 year old loves them just as much as I do, and anything that me at 40 and her at 14 can both enjoy is amazing.', ""Freaking addictive! Worth the money.. all of their games. So well done. You can tell how much work went into these games. 50 out of 5 stars, you guys. Don't stop making these....because I need answers. 😂 I'm about to bring in the new year playing the third game lol ❤️"", 'Great game but often somethings are hidden and the controls dont allow you to see that view unless you are very precise about where you click making it sometimes hard to proceed in the game. Over all I enjoyed the game it wasnt to fast to get to the end but I did make it to the end without frusteration.', 'Very much had the feel of Myst. Enjoyed playing this though had to use the hints a lot because the hiding places for items can be very tricky. Glad there are games for us who like to slowly explore without tests of speed and dexterity.', ""These games are great, and have fantastic puzzles to solve. I've played one and two now and looking forward to getting three. There are sections that might be a little scary for some but not awful and not horror.""]"

And before i even finished the video inthought I'd check it out (incase of spoilers) The game was under $2 so i thought why not, Chris know his puzzle stuff, ill give it a go... OMG ... I'm a huge fan now!!! Thanks to the maker's of this Awesome game & Chris Ramsay for the recommendation. Cant wait for more games! Please keep them reasonably priced thou. I'm a poorbie 😊"", ""I love this game! I don't usually buy games and stick with free. But I'd read that paid games are better in game play and graphics. I was not disappointed! I love puzzles but I've found I'm so bored with the available puzzle games these days. Everyone is all about match three or hidden item. But this! This gem is a true puzzle game. I will definitely be buying the complete series! Graphics are amazing. Game play is flawless. Just love it!"", ""Brilliant, thank you! Lovely graphics, music and atmosphere. No ads, no other added costs, just good gameplay. Pricing model is spot on - create a great game, give it away and know it's good enough that people will be happy to buy future installments. Which is exactly what I will be doing. Only con I can think of is the controls aren't always easy - the zoom in and out could do with changing. Seems that others have commented similarly, but this game is more than worth that niggle."", ""This game is the benchmark for what a mobile game should deliver. Great controls, immersive environment, creative writing and an overall engaging experience. Oh, and let's not forget.....NO IN APP PURCHASES! This, and every other game in this series is an absolute homerun! Keep up the great work Fireproof. You have garnered a lifelong loyal fan in me."", 'It is very solvable without clues. Just put the game down for 10 minutes, clear your mind, come back at a new angle. Do not forget to look at things that seem to do nothing on the surface with a way of looking under the surface. I just needed the first HINT on a few things to point me in the right direction without giving me the answer directly. Unlike most puzzle games, no answer left me puzzled as to how anyone could possibly connect clues to get the answer. Fixed income but buying the rest.', ""Downloaded because I saw Chris Ramsay's video on this game. It was worth every minute of play. Hint system does well to steer you in the right direction without making the puzzles easier or giving anything away. Definitely has a ton of replay value, as does the second in the series. Would love to see much longer games but still worth 5 stars."", 'I enjoy this game each time I play it. The puzzles are fun and there is not a lot of running from room-to-room to finish them: only when necessary. The length of time required to finish it is different for everyone, but regardless of the time you invest, it is well-worth the wait. I hope these games keep coming!', ""I loved the game but some controls were hypersensitive, making some parts more difficult than necessary, but it was more of an annoyance than anything. It didnt detract from the fun of the game at all! It's too bad there isn't a free version. I would not mind watching ads for a game this good."", 'Really makes you think and gets the brain working.

Very imaginative and clever.', ""Incredible game. It took me about 4-5 hours to solve the game. You've definitely got me hooked on this one. I will definitely be getting the next one and playing them with my son to see how long it takes him to solve all the puzzles. I have to admit I did get stuck a few times and had to resort to the clues but it didn't detract anything from the experience."", 'I remeber when I first downloaded this game back in 2013. I was sceptical to spend money on an app seeing as apps were really just starting to be of a more popular brand. This game and all of its sequels are marvelous. Graphics, controls, gameplay, pacing are all wonderful. Not to mention the tone and environment is consistent throughout the entire game. This game series will always be my favorite. 6/5 stars.', ""11 stars! Packed, absolutely packed with puzzles. In each chapter. Each chapter has as many puzzles as some whole other games in this genre. I found myself in turns hating and loving the devs. I especially like the story, and how they don't let it interfere. They give you just enough story to let your imagination wander, as you're trying to solve the puzzles. Devious, just devious. But please, do not try this game if you get upset real quick about not figuring something out real quick."", 'This series is honestly the best Thrilling Adventure/Puzzle mobile game series ive EVER played on my phone !! Their so much fun to play and i cant find any other games similar to this series which REALLY SUCKS .-. but i really hope the game makers of this series release more games like this!! I definatley want to play more!!', ""It is a good game. And not expensive at a dollar, but a sort of easy and very short game. Wish we could get some new content without having to buy the new games. And not sure if I want to spend money on the newest games if they don't last more than a couple of hours like this one did. But it is an excellent concept for a puzzle game."", 'Best puzzle game EVER! My friend and I spent like 2 hours trying to figure out the puzzles and it was 2 hours of awesomeness! Too bad I dont have any more money 2 buy the 3 games including the 4th one. You see what I did there? 2,3,4 get it? But anyways thanks for creating this game because it is AMAZING! Oh, and the graphics are great! And now I am at 358 letters out of 500...including symbols and spaces. I am a Smart 7th grader and this took me like 4 days!Thanks for making this its cool! Bye!', 'Relatively new to escape rooms, but like puzzles in general. Gorgeously rendered images. Some of the puzzles are quite clever. A few, occasionally, are not that logical. But really nice atmosphere and overall, quite enjoyable and addictive. Worth a couple of dollars to play.', ""The room series are the best games in the play store. The sounds, the graphics, the challenges, and hidden truths to alchemy. I don't normally rate games. This game deserves it. When you play you will find that you exit the earth while you absorb yourself in the gameplay. I'm convinced that the actual creator of this game has some knowledge in the dark forces of sorcery. There was even a Stonehendge type set up. Don't take my word for it. NO POP UPS OR GIMMICKS."", ""Great game, some of the puzzles were pretty dang difficult but never too frustrating, the hints were very helpful but never flat out told you what to do so you're not being spoon fed the answer. Going to buy the next game right now!"", 'All the puzzles within the puzzles are rather fun. Some things are very difficult to find, but if you dont mind using the hints, they are quite helpful when you skimmed right past something earlier. If not, take your time.', ""Great game, I think it's worth the price. Graphics are a lot better than most mobile games, the plot is interesting and compelling, and the puzzles are a perfect level of challenging. The controls can be a little fiddly, but I think this is the kind of game your play if you like fiddling. The hints are great because they don't tell you the answer, but point you in the right direction. I love the occult-y storyline. It's a good way to spend an hour or two. I intend to get the sequels as well!"", ""This is amazing. I found this app because of Chris Ramasy's YouTube channel and it is well worth the download. If you are into puzzles and brain teasers this app is for you. I'm no where near advanced as some of the puzzle solvers I have seen but this kept me intrigued and wanting to keep moving forward even though I didn't know what to do next. Download this app because it is worth your time."", ""adore this game. I love mechanical puzzle games and I've never seen one as well done for mobile as this. while it is a little short, it's well worth the 99 cents I paid for it and the graphics are phenomenal, definitely buying part 2 👍"", 'WOW!!!! I am so impressed at the way this puzzle was ( very thoughtfully ) mind you,. Planned and executed! It is my pleasure to play such a well made Masterpiece! I search the globe for interestingly different and unique elements in all the puzzles out there and you finally have that creation! Bravo and Thank You! Keep up this wonderful work on', 'Hello people 👋🏻 I\'m really enjoying ""The Room: Epilogue."" I saved up Google Rewards to buy this game & I see myself purchasing more from Fireproof based on this experience. I\'m only moderately skilled in puzzling & found the game intriguing and challenging. The clue system is clever and rewards patience, frequently resulting in a gentle face palm for me. Some of the controls were not intuitive, so a minor knock there. Overall, this is a beautiful and well-executed puzzle game. Nicely done!', '""The Room"" is absolutely one of the best puzzle games ever. Albeit it has it\'s own weak spots. Amongst them is having excessive chest puzzles and less various riddles; unlike the Room two that has more liberal environment and variegated mystries. Likewise having a few levels is another problem which should be paid attention if there are going to be more spectacular puzzle games from Fireproof. Wish you a great future👍', ""I love this game and the three that follow after. These are the only games I have ever spent money on and would all over again. I wish I could have my memory of the game wiped just to play it over again. I still do anyways, it's so much fun and there is so much, it's easy to forget it all and redo it again with almost as much of a challenge as the first time. Hints are free, but the game makes enough sense to not need them frequently. I HIGHLY recommend this game!"", 'The game has stunning graphics. Effort was visible throughout the game and leaves the users a good impression. It has the most challenging and creative puzzles I have seen yet. There are no bugs encountered although one major problem in the game is that the brightness keeps adjusting to low which is not suitable especially if I were to play outdoors. I would definitely buy the sequel for this. Must download for its worthy price.', ""Such a great game. The puzzle boxes and the atmosphere are mysterious enough to keep you going. I passed on this game for years. Didn't realize I was missing out. I commend the developers. Great job!"", 'A-mazing Game literally! This game is very well made, the graphics are awesome. There is a great amount of time and detail put into this series. It is challenging and addicting. Absolutely worth the money, no adds. Just great mind boggling puzzles and a good story line .', ""This was a lot of fun!!! I only wish there were more chapters so I could keep going. This would be totally baller if it's available for VR! (I've chills just thinking about it XD )"", ""This was such an unexpected delight! I'd been searching for a good puzzle/escape game and this one delivered! I didn't know much going in and was pleasantly surprised by the occult theme! The puzzles are challenging but not infuriating, the story is creative, and the visuals are stunning!"", 'Caved and bought the game. One of THE BEST games I\'ve ever played on my phone. Controls work perfectly, challenging puzzles, and you can choose to use the hints or not. Def worth it!! Played every version of ""The Room"" games and they are all top-notch!! All are 5 star games!', ""The game is great when it works, but I don't understand why it's so hard to double tap something to zoom in certain spots. Some elements have time limits and I find myself fighting just to zoom in to perform an action. And it's not now and then, it's constantly fighting just to press the correct thing over and over. I really want to like it but it's completely unplayable."", ""This game is really great! Totally worth $1 if you like puzzles and escape type games. Superb graphics. Super smooth gameplay. Somewhat short, but it's high quality. Definitely gonna go buy all the other Room games by these folks. Nicely done."", 'Thank god this game has consistently progress saving! Spet over an hour on this game disregarding the fact my phone was dying xD But loaded it back up and right were I left off. Thank goodness. It is a fairly addictive game and worth the $1. Kept me preoccupied so far😁 Looking forward to buy their new series. Might be complicated for some but they give you plenty of clues when you are completely lost.', 'So far I have only completed 2 puzzles but I am hooked. Best 99 cents I have ever spent. There is a guy on YouTube who finds complex puzzles and figures out how to open them. This game is like that but virtual and I love it.

Also, you have way less ads if any, than other games. Great job and please make more of all of them.', ""Usually don't play these kind of games because the puzzles are extremely hard or they want real money at some point. This game has a slight learning curb, but fun to play once you get the hang of it. Puzzles are challenging but not so difficult that you want to throw your device across the room. Good job developers."", ""OMG is this game hard. The puzzles are great but trying to figure out what is a puzzle or not and what does or does not open is a pain. There are no directions so you spend a lot of time clicking everything to see if it's important."", 'I genuinely love this game. This is my second game from the Adventure escape series and I prefer this one to the Hidden Ruins one. This one seems to get increasingly harder whereas the other one started off difficult straight off the bat. If you are choosing between the Adventure Escape games, choose this one!', 'I like this game a lot. This is the second by the same makers I\'ve played. Try asylum, it\'s awesome. There should be an ""are you sure you want to skip"" message before it lets you spend a bunch of hint stars on accident. I wanted to solve that puzzle with the family tree but accidentally hit skip.', 'Was a fun game until putting the letter together and the ""skip"" for 25 stars is so huge i accidentally touched it since its in the part of the screen to put the letter together. So i used up stars to solve something i was not needing solved. Very poor placement of that. Was a huge interruption of the game for me and a waste of potential hint usage.', 'Still pretty good, but an oldie I think. The zooming on the puzzles makes me dizzy and some of the clues are really not very clear. Also the hints are not as useful as they are in more recent games. Fortunately all these issues are not present in the latest games (which are usually a solid 5 stars)!', 'Addicting! I was looking for a different type of game since most of the ones out there are very similar. And this is exactly what I was looking for!! It challenges my brain and has a great storyline.', ""LOVE these 😍🤓\U0001f9e0😎😘 Such FUN, ROBUST, STIMULATING workouts for our brains/intellect! Here's something I just figured out n it's something they should've told us upfront (gee, would've sure made the first ones that much easier & MORE ENJOYABLE \U0001f928!) Anyways, for each new level/task, we're usually stuck wondering what the objectives/rules of each new riddle/challenge/puzzle are, and the pop-up phrases (when u tap each object/person) aren't ever enough! Just hit Hint -- the first's always FREE 😉!"", ""I like this game but it is almost too hard. I play games in this genre and am finding that I have to buy hints when I normally don't. I will edit my review if I figure this one out!!"", 'Nice variety of moderately difficult puzzles, however, it seems quite glitchy. I know what I need, but am unable to pick it up. Also, Back button and Skip are right next to each other, so I tapped Skip when I juat wanted to go back. Graphics are dated.', ""I would give this game more stars but the clues don't help. It gives you a clue to what you already know. For example as far as adjusting the emblem for the bird, it tells you that three rings move at the same time. Once all the rings are there you already know this. So it doesn't give you a clue on how to adjust it. They could tell people the flower goes at the top instead. Also when I was in the garden I tapped for the handle to make the water come out, it did noth till after I tapped hint"", ""Really good puzzles, challenging but not impossible. This is the second game I've played by these guys and they have both been fantastic."", ""That was great!! I played Asylum last night and this one today and I'll either be playing cult or carnival after I rate this. The puzzles weren't too hard until the billiard room. I won't go into detail for those who haven't played it yet, but that sucked lol. Eventually I got it but geez. Loved it, keep them coming!!!"", ""Frustrating. Got to a chapter where I knew the solution but the game had missed a step and not given me all the numbers I needed. Even the hints were convinced I had the numbers, but I didn't, I only had three of four. Was enjoying before then. Would like to continue playing if the dev can fix this bug. Spent all my points getting hints to a puzzle I already knew the answer to, but it wasn't that I missed something. Looks like something just didn't work correctly...."", 'Just awesome. The visuals and graphics are superb. The levels are a bit challenging, means you have to click at the screen to get an idea about your next move. Also the puzzles are a bit hard and it needs thought to solve it. Summing up it is a fine game and if you are lover of tough challenges this is for u!', ""This game needs some improving! Either the tasks are ridiculously easy n boring or too difficult or impossible to work out because the clues do not aid enough. And it will cut to the next scene when you haven't prompted it to yet. Annoying and frustrating. Also the dialogue between characters is not entertaining n pointless"", ""No instructions at all. The introduction is boring and doesn't make sense. I got to the point where I picked up the letter i and it automatically went into a white square on the side of the screen. No explanation for what the squares are for. The only other thing I can do is tap the lock to make it say that it is locked or tap the spot the i fell off to make it say it looks like a letter is missing. Tapping anywhere else does nothing.

I love that there are a few maps which I found it a bit complicated but then turn out to be really simple, if you just CHANGE THE WAY YOU LOOK AT IT. It's a relaxing game, meanwhile you can still practice your brain, but more than just that, it helps me to look at life differently. Thank you!"", ""It's absolutley amazing you can use it anywhere; everywhere at any time you like. I've had this game for a while now and I am only just reviewing it as i have found no flaws at all. Awesome. I guess it is for ages 7+ as i think that children under the age of seven will not be able to process the fact that it is a dot to dot but it is in the form of pixels on your device. I also think that it 's background can be varied in different patterns and colours as it is boring having just the same thing."", ""Game is decent but the ads, ads, ads, ads, ads, ads, ads, ads, ads.... Most game levels only take seconds to complete, though occasionally there's a head-scratcher. So you end up with ads several times a minute! And many of the ads will automatically open playstore no matter what you do, so really you'll quite likely end up spending more time fighting off ads than playing the game. I don't mind reasonable ads, we all gotta pay the bills, but come on guys, this just ain't cool."", ""It's a fun game, but theres too many ads. They play pretty much after every 1-2 levels. This is one of the least user-friendly games I've ever played. Also theres an ad that's plays whenever you want a hit that closes straight away and you cant get another hint ad for some reason. You just have to sit through an ad without a hint. Very disappointing experience"", ""This game is so elegant and relaxing that it is the only one I've redownloaded and given 5 stars. The sheer number of puzzles is impressive, and the varieties of sizes and types keep Flow entertaining. My only criticism is that the difficulty of the puzzles plateaus despite increasing grid size. I'm solving most of the 10×10s in under a minute each, but still enjoying the game overall. Well done!"", ""Haven't played Android version, but played it all the time on my Kindle when I was 5 or so.

Just make sure you're saved to the WiFi address so you can get back on when needed."", ""Did rate it 5* but recently they've added a ridiculous number of long unskippable ads - they're every 3 games or so, which is usually less than a minute!

Seriously addictive game, challenging enough to be interesting without being so hard it's frustrating!"", ""A really good puzzle game that I have spent many hrs playing, so good that I paid for the extra levels and I don't normally pay for anything extra, I have played the other Flow Free games and enjoyed them too and I like the challenge as the levels get harder and would recommend this to anyone who's searching for a really good puzzle game 👍"", ""Fun and extremely challenging! I feel like this game really gives my brain a challenge so it can improve and grow. It also includes strategy and major thinking. Please at least try this game out before judging the game by comments/reviews and try this great game! It doesn't even advertise itself which also makes it a great game!

Feels like they're trying to force me to pay to remove them."", ""I've enjoyed playing this game for years now, and remain a fan of the gameplay. The daily puzzles are challenging without being too difficult and the included games are numerous and stimulating. Most content may be purchased for $2 to remove ads. I play daily and find it to be a great stress reliever and solid way to keep my mind active."", 'This is a great game however I cant afford to give it a higher rating due to the fact that the ads are incessant. They are absolutely relentless. They pop up in the middle of levels, after every level, and everywhere in between. It completely and utterly ruins the experience.', 'Relaxing, fun, and enjoyable, this app is perfect for all ages! Simple for kids (no offense), and stragetic for adults! I recommend it for anyone who wants to find a good app to play in their free time.', ""So I looked at the reviews and saw too buggy, too many ads, ect. But here's the thing. They say it's ad free with no in app purchases and not only does it have ads but it also has in app purchases so we literally get lied to before even playing the game"", ""The game itself is fantastic and my favorite offline game! I highly recommend. However, recently I have been getting ads with sound that can't be muted or closed which means that I can no longer play in public without headphones. I'd rather stop playing than be cornered into paying for the ad-free version."", ""In 2014 my neurosurgeon saw me playing this game and recommended it along with any problem solving puzzles and games. I had just had an aneursym clipped. Not only do I find relaxation while playing I'm also exercising a part of my brain that was damaged."", ""The game is already ad supported, but each new update ads a higher frequency of ads appearing. I used to be able to finish 10-15 levels before an ad, now I get one every 2-5 levels. I was willing to pay the $4.99 to purchase, but user experience is so poor that I'm reluctant to give the money. It feels like the makers are making the game unplayable to force you to buy it or else make a bunch of money by crushing you with ads."", ""Awesome game, probably my number one game! I'm actually a freelance brain surgeon and thanks to this game I'm finally making ALL the right connections, no more goofballs from me! This game is better than most brain-type games, I've paid to unlock all packs but you should have a donate thingy as well, I don't need to buy the hints, I'm a lawyer remember. Highly recommended! Please make another with, I dunno, time travel and goats? All my friends here at NASA would love that... to turn back time."", ""This used to be a fun game. Now they have an advertisement after nearly every puzzle. To make matters worse the advertisements are timed so you have to view the whole ad. Very frustrating!!!! Don't waste your time on this one."", 'This game makes good use of the touch screen is very easy to learn and some levels are a bit challenging. One complaint, after completing several hundred levels the app crashed and despite using ""play games"" after reinstalling I had to start from scratch. Possible improvements, a head to head mode, ability to play user selected music in background and the obvious removal of ads. At least not so many.', 'Super fun and addictive. Simple to use and understand. Plenty of modes and very few ads which is great, overall just an enjoyable time waster (in a good way)', ""I have each Flow Game installed & love them all. But THIS is the One: inthe starter pack, as u learn it gets harder. After, there's many packs to get harder or not: many options, perfect! This one also intros the other Flow games (Hex, Warp, Bridges etc) for ur next move! Last: Ads exist for a reason (dev support). Before PlayPass, I happily paid a small sum to remove ads & support the team. This is worth the try: Play It!"", 'I enjoy this game. I believe it is helping keep my brain sharp as I continue through the aging process. The more puzzles I complete, the faster I am able to move through the packets. Thank you.', 'Very fun game!! It makes you think harder and is very fun to play!!! Ads are very tame and do not pop up as much as you would find in any other apps. I give all 5 stars, to this amazing game!! I will for sure be playing more of this fun game!', 'Ads! Ads! Ads!!!! another victim of greedy developers, forcing you to watch ads every 1-5 levels. beautiful game, destroyed by ads. If you dont mind exiting the game and re-entering every 2minutes, play it.', 'BEWARE !!! You will never be able to have a perfect Achievement status if you make mistakes. After years of play, I achieved all games as starred perfect packs, but not so in Achievements. The unpublished rules don\'t allow for human error or striving to be rewarded for correcting mistakes for stars. Publishers quote.....""There is no way to change those checks to stars -- that is just the way the achievements were designed.""', ""Let me say I love this game, it's calming in fact. I know there is ads, Im fine with ads, but I am not fine with a ad in the middle of my time trial. There should be no ads during a time trail, I extremely hate that, thats why Im giving it a 1 star."", 'Having to watch a 30 second video ad after every level is ridiculous. Especially when puzzles are completed in a couple of minutes, you spend more time watching ads. DELETE!!!!', ""LOVE this game. The game itself is 5 star. The free version has SO many ads it's no longer fun to play. If you buy the game for just a few dollars it may be better."", 'I had to uninstall it after two days..... . Every second time you play, they show you an advert. If you play the game twice, you have to watch a 1 minute advert video. Its annoying!!! . Game is not bad, but boring and too many adverts.', ""Fun game that offers a good bit of entertainment. The levels in the first few packs are pretty easy but they do get challenging as you get to the 10x10's"", ""I love this game it's my favorite not to many ads, fun daily challenges,and its simple, (in my opinion that's good) and I really hope they don't do to many updates and ruin it like has been happening with all my other games."", 'This game is best offline game.but i have completed all the levels and i need more level because in my job i get off and during that i get board got so i request if possible launch new pack in a 2 weeks or atleast a month. By the way the game is awesome and i really enjoy this game thank you guys.', ""Fun. But the UI needs a little work. The hint button is easily hit, and there's no confirmation - so your three free hints are easily wasted. But, I guess the developers are trying to train us to not to buy tips? -\\_(o.O)_/-"", 'Ive played this game everyday for nearly 2 years. Yesterday it just decided it wouldnt open anymore!! Its challenging and fun but im really upset over not being able to keep my daily score going.. its lost the review 2 stars', 'Love this app, one of the most relaxing ones out there.

Your graphics could probably be improved, but I have yet attained the ultimate levels, so I can't to see what I can achieve a far as higher levels of play.

It seems to do this on purpose so player will be forced to purchase bombs and what not. On the plus side you get many many lives.', ""It was a lot of fun till the last update. As it gets more difficult, it's also harder to get booters because the spin is so limited. Then with fewer boosters available, the offer of more moves if we use them is frustrating. This is supposed to be fun, not work. I'm pretty close to uninstalling this game, but I'll decide after this latest update."", ""I love this game but every time I use coins to get 5 more moves in a level, the game freezes, I can't make my five moves, and I have to get out of the app and go back in again, where of course I've lost my level and my coins 😠 Update: previous problem seems to be fixed now, thank goodness!"", ""This annoyed me enough to write my very first review ever! Was offered 182 premium cash for another game if I beat level 100; spent weeks doing so and never recieved anything. Contacted customer support and they told me I was ineligible despite providing multiple screenshots. Definitely would have kept the game as it's good for killing time and mildly challenging depending on your skill level. But after they treated me like this? No. Better off getting a game that isn't from Tapjoy..."", ""This was a good game, I'm on level 3635, but now they dont give any extras on the daily wheel spin to get helpful items, it's mostly tickets and they have gone up on the points to get stuff and down on the time to have them.

I'm thinking about quitting the game, even though I have been playing it for a couple years."", ""Was great but this latest update just stops the game from progressing yet it won't update. I have tried many times but it just spins now and blocks the game. 5 bars of service doesn't help. Restart doesn't help. I will have to uninstall and move on to a different game. Too bad, so sad but done."", 'This game was good in the beginning but not so much now. You dont receive your free hours of play or other bonuses.

The only negative thing that has happened, is when I'm just 1 or 2 moves from finishing the level, and need to purchase coins and after the transaction goes through, I lose the game. I have to start over. It's frustrating to say the less. I should have tried to get ahold of support, but I'm very lazy when it comes to dealing with things like this. Also the amount of money I spent wasn't much, just enough to get what I needed to finish and win. Only game I play.🦉"", 'I\'ve always liked this game. It was better before the addition of the pets, though. They seem to just exist so people will buy stuff for them. Dogs don\'t even make sense in a game about baking!

Ive had Problems with the Boosters not Appearing when you Click them in your Chosen game. Like...Cookie Walk. When you get to the Third Walk, the Game takes over. But i always go back for more. I cant wait to OPEN this Updated Game.', ""Game used to be fun, now it's all about buying boosters that give you half the time it used to. Game cheats frequently in order to pressure you into buying the win. Whoever is in charge of development really doesn't want anyone playing this game anymore. Getting way too greedy and just taking all the joy out of it. Very disappointing."", ""I'm trying not to be too hard on my review as I have been playing for years with no issues. However since the beginning of January I have had issues. I have not seen one pet token fall in a full month now. I would like to be able to receive some of the new pet clothing. Please fix this soon."", ""The game continues to block you from winning until a set number of games, so there's no need to waste your money to purchase anything.

Too many other problems to mention. The biggest one is can\'t win coins anymore other than from the spinner which is ultra rare.', ""It's fun but the bottom is cut off and I can't minimize the game to see the boosters.

Forever to load, too', ""I would give this a minus rating if I could.

You rarely get a chance to get any of the mittens, roller pin, etc. anymore...the spinner prizes suck! That\'s why I stopped playing it....then the events are just ""time"" to PLAY longer?

Thanks to everyone who are playing the game and have supported us :)","[""I love your puzzles, but I'm so tired of having to keep them shrunk back down to size. As I put the pieces together the puzzle keeps blowing up and I'm not hitting any thing to cause this problem. Is there any way you can fix this problem. Let me know because this is kind of killing my enthusiasm of putting these beautiful puzzles together. Thanks, BettyFByrnes"", 'Easy to use with great pictures and ability to use your own. I have tried multiple jigsaw games but this one is by far the best. I would however like to see a filling system added to the your picture section so that I can have say landscapes and people that I have uploaded seperate to make it easier if I am looking for a specific one. Otherwise 5 star app.', ""Excellent puzzles, so good that you can separate the edge pieces first, also good that you have the option to be able to rotate the pieces too if you want which makes it a bit more interesting! Yes there are some adverts but they don't last long! I am thoroughly enjoying these puzzles - have to say they are somewhat addictive!"", ""Coolest app I've ever downloaded (and I've played a lot and am very critical). The puzzle packs are very affordable and you get a lot in each pack (you can spend a lot of money for one physical puzzle to put it in perspective). For a very affordable one-time fee you can turn your own photos into puzzles. Now when I say affordable this is coming from a guy who works only 15 hours a week; meaning I'm on a tight budget so affordable for me is more than affordable for most. No complaints whatsoever."", ""Good puzzle app. I liked the developer's mahjong game and decided to give this one a try. My only complaint is that almost all of the puzzles (even the ones for purchase) are photos with a ton of featureless space around the edges of the subject -- not good for puzzles. I'd love to see more artwork with more detail around the edges, especially of things like dinosaurs, fantasy landscapes, and mythological creatures like dragons and unicorns and stuff. But I can always make my own anyway."", 'I love the layout and playability of this app! Some things especially that I love is being able to see the whole board at once or zoom in seamlessly, choose pop up or full screen preview, choose how many piece puzzle, choose to sort out edges only to start with, and the organized scatter option to put all the loose pieces in rows along the edges. I spend hours on this app!', ""Lots of FUN if you LOVE working puzzles as much as I do. When I was growing up, our family would get together with an aunt and uncle of mine and would spend HOURS working BIG puzzles together. Those times are some of my FAVORITE childhood memories. These are some BEAUTIFUL puzzles here. I've been working puzzles kind've frequently, and these are among the BEST ones that I've seen. ."", ""Love the puzzles but unfortunately the app doesn't work properly on my Chromebook any more. Best puzzles because you can see all the pieces at once rather than one by one on a tray. Have found ways around the issue around the Chromebook & this app. It's kind of a pain but it's worth it for me because I don't like the puzzles that use the tray format."", ""I went through every jigsaw puzzle game offered.. This has lots of pieces, rotation, (I love the sound of them locking together) and of course, great choice of puzzles- even people that don't pay. No ads problem. I don't want to seem ungrateful, but your free daily puzzles are always kittens and landscapes which we who can't afford to buy the cool puzzles get in our choices anyway. Can't we please have more free abstracish puzzles? Hugs & hearts, thankyou."", ""I enjoy these puzzles, so relaxing and beautiful when finished. I also like that I can save the puzzles to my device!

Veteran players don't need hints just fair puzzles."", ""Legitimately my favorite time-killing app. I don't write reviews often, but this app stands out. 1) If you only have a minute to play, you can still enjoy the game without having to refocus your attention.

They don't bother me. 3) It's not addictive, yet I don't get tired of it. 4) If I'm stuck on a plane with nothing to do, I can play this game for hours and not get bored.

Triple Town is an original puzzle game in which you try to grow the greatest possible city. The larger the city you build, the more points you score. You build your city by matching three or more game-pieces: combine three grasses to make a bush, three bushes to make a tree... until you've filled the board with houses, cathedrals and castles. Along the way, you'll have to outwit giant bears who will try to block your progress.

How large can you grow your dream city before the board fills and the game ends?

UNLIMITED TURNS: This game is free, but we need to earn a living somehow. So eventually, after playing for a while, you will run out of turns and will need to wait for them to refresh over time, or you can buy more turns with the free coins you earn in the game. OR, if you love the game and would like to support small independent game developers like us, you can purchase unlimited turns *forever* for a one-time fee. If you do, you can use them on *any* compatible Android device you own (that supports Google Play.) Just install the game on your other Android devices and select ""restore unlimited turns"" in the game's options menu.

Please note that while Triple Town may work with devices that have been modded and are running custom ROMs, we cannot guarantee that it will work. If you have modded your devices, please be aware that you are using Triple Town at your own risk.

The reason i give this a 1 star is because I have been playing this game for over 5 years on and off. I tried to restore my purchases because I have litterarly bought everything in this game. But when I tried to restore my game after maybe a year or two I got a prompt saying no purchases. I think that that is bad. It made me want to post and warn ppl. i dont even want to play the game anymore', 'The upgrade is 1,000% optional, and I kind of miss the moves system of the free version. Made it more addictive. The free version is a great complete game that feels complete w/o upgrading. And still this is one of a tiny minority of apps I pay for. The extra features feel optional but worthwhile. Some people will feel the move limitation is exactly the kind of ""you can totally play w/o upgrading jk lol"" freemium deception I\'m saying it\'s not, but I would literally turn it back on sometimes. A+', ""For some reason daily boom town challenges disappeared recently. Only reason I'm docking one star. Otherwise a fun game. I used Google rewards to purchase all the options long ago. Been playing for years, since installing on my first smart phone! Really hoping the daily challenges come back because I got into a bit of a routine with them."", ""I've been playing this game waaay back in my browser and was glad to find it here in Google Play. First in-app purchase ever and have lost nothing but some good hours of sleep 😴 (That's what unlimited moves do. I'm over it btw. 😅) On the other hand, seems like the timed challenges were gone (?) But nevertheless this is a very good game to pass the time. Good job devs. 🌟"", ""Leaving this review to counter the recent one-star... I purchased Triple Town unlimited turns in 2012, easily the best $3.99 I've spent for almost 8 years of entertainment. I can't count how many turns, boom towns, and times I've played this game. Absolutely supurb staying power and super cute bears. My only wish is that I could purchase one of those cute bears as a plush from Spryfox, because they are too cute!!!"", ""I confess to playing this game for years without paying a cent for it. Mosty I didn't want to buy the unlimited turns because I knew I'd have a hard time stopping playing. Running out of turns helped enforce a stopping point. Now that I've got unlimited turns, I just keep going! The game is intriguing and involves so much more strategy than other addictive digital games. Thank you for a great game!"", ""WARNING: Very addictive! An awesome twist on the match 3 games. It's like a match 3 mixed with a miniature Civilization game. After one day of playing, I had to purchase the full thing. Can't recommend this game enough!"", ""For the past week, every time I complete the live events, I am unable to collect the coins. Please please fix this. If it has happened in the past few months before and it's still happening now, has it never been fixed?"", ""I love it. Bought it on PC and needed to have it on the go as well. This is a game worth buying in full version! I'm playing triple town now for about 5 years maybe. Still playing it. Worth every penny!"", 'I have idea what to expect when I unlock new map... Great, thanks for the link. You should really add this information in the game as I am now more convinced to make the purchase for more maps. I am going leave this review as it is as you made waste time to leave this review. Great game!', ""I've been playing triple town for years but never left a review. I felt it was time. It was the first game I ever spent money on and money well spent. Only had to do it once and then it follows me to every new device I get. Be warned. The game is simple yet EXTREMELY addictive."", ""This is a demo. They neglect to tell you this...on purpose. You have a finite number of moves until youre require to pay. To the developer: this is an app. I play apps while waiting at the dentist, or while using the bathroom. I'm not paying you anything."", 'Great game to play offline. No ads. Had the app for years and enjoy every bit of it.', ""I can't believe I haven't reviewed this game! I've been playing since around the time it was released, over 7 years ago, and it's the one mobile game that keeps me coming back. I bought the unlimited turns unlock and it's the best app purchase I've ever made. Honestly I don't even remember how much it cost, but it's been well worth it. This is my cozy good feels game. No matter where I am in life it's always been there for me. Absolutely love."", 'Played this game few years ago and it was fun. But now, this game isn\'t that fun anymore. Limited turns, too many bears, pricey items at store and the worst is that the live events didn\'t give me my rewards (not only once or twice, but almost every single event DIDN\'T reward me, saying ""PRIZE PENDING""). Such disappointment.', 'What happened to when you won trophies and things to build your main town back when this game was played with email on computers I remeber building my own town and playing the game the way it is now. I miss the main town part bring it back 😭', 'Ive been playing this game since my last year of high school (2013) Im much better at it now hahahahaha. Will always pay for it because the devs deserve it so much. Thank you for this piece of art!', ""After a major app purge last year, this is the only game still in my phone. I think it's the first game I ever spent money on years and years ago and I still love it. Please never go away, Triple Town!!! 😍"", ""Loved the game since forever. Still do. Generous with free players regarding turns and has fun competitions against yourself. Still pissed. You can't just give me 10 ninja bears in a row without any killer robots and expect everything to be all good... it's happened multiple times and i guess it's part of the game but also it's too much"", ""Love this game, simple play and great when you want a quick game that isn't too complicated to play."", 'I have so much fun with this game. I love the simplicity of it yet it is hard! Love the graphics and sounds! This is the perfect game!', 'This is everything you want from a puzzle game great aesthetic the UI is intuitive and plenty of variety in game modes love It!', 'Best game ever. Been playing for years. Whenever I feel anxious I just start playing this game and it helps me relax. Thank you for this game.', ""I've been playing this for years. Love what you've done lately. Would like to see the time games included in the steam version too. Looks like I'll be playing for a few more years still... 🏠"", 'Love it! It\'s simple, doesnt just chuck a bunch of ""This building will take three days to finish building, use diamonds/gems to speed it up?"". The game moves at your pace, and time only moves when you place an item, unless you are playing with the timer maps of course. I built a bear prison haha.', ""Great simple 3 in a row game. Limits your turns and forces you to wait for turns or watch an ad for 40 clicks. At least there's no ad spam. 5$ for the full game which is a fair price."", ""Fantastic, I've played for years across various platforms. probably looks best on a smaller screen, like a phone. it's completely possible to play for free and feel satisfied, I have unlocked all seasons and animals and have no trouble buying more turns or certain units when I need them. I do wish there was an option to unlock more maps with coins instead of buying real turns, though."", ""it's alright. i played this years ago and had unlimited turns and it was really fun. but it won't restore my purchases and if you don't buy the unlimited turns then this is basically just a free demo game. your play is extremely limited if you don't spend money. also the graphics are very dated and don't look that great anymore"", ""I've been addicted to this game for years. I'm on my third paid account across multiple platforms and os."", ""I think I installed this game when it first came out I had it on a Nokia phone that tells you how old this game is and how long I've had it. it's a great game I refuse to uninstall. sometimes I don't play it for a long time but when I do I'm playing many boards on end. I also had an issue with the reinstalling purchases (moves) but that's taken care of. developers need to give this game an update PLEASE. don't just create new games and forget about this classic. not fair to those who have it."", ""Having given this a go, I feel it's probably not worth more than 3.5/5 🌟 Sure it's an addictive, graphically pleasing little puzzler that mashes a 3-match puzzle game with 2046. Didn't mind paying for unlimited moves either, but it's random nature makes it a flawed experience. Of course you have to be really good & understand it's structure to get the best out of it, which I'm not, but 5 bears in a row before I reached 5,000 pts?! It's more luck than skill that ultimately decides a good score"", 'Used to played this game heaps but then my phone was broken and i moved to iphone. Now im back to using android it is still addicted. However, for some reason i cant restore my purchase and it makes me sad :(', 'I have played it when it frist come out a very long time a go. My grans son was two and he went nuts over it. So i love it and my 4 year old gran daught has to be right be side me to watch', ""I rarely rate things 5 stars because at some point (usually within a few weeks) I lose interest. I have had this game for about a year and still play it. It's so simple, but it's really challenging. Even with the free version, the two modes that it allows you to play are really fun and trying to figure out how to make different things within the game keeps me coming back. It's definitely my favorite game."", 'for sure the best game on my phone for over 2yrs considering: - Free (read below for more turns tactics) - great for quick moves on a break - great for long runs (3hours without even noticing) - ALWAYS fun and rewarding once learned how to play efficently - low on battery life/storage - offline ""endless turns"": Start every game by dumping every cristal you get until a big chest, and don\'t aim for a long run. after some gold is stacked you won\'t have any problem with your turns LOVE THIS GAME', ""My son introduced me to this game. Other games come and go from my phone but this one has a permanent home. I even paid for unlimited play. Excellent app for killing time when you're stuck somewhere like the airport, or just to unwind. Love this game!"", 'No longer get any challenge games. Hard to gain extra points.', ""I can't believe I've been playing this game since 2014. I must've poured hundreds of hours into it. It's simple, but perfectly balanced to require just enough forethought and strategy to be effective anxiety relief for me. Thanks, Triple Town!"", ""I've been playing this game for the last 6 years and I can never get bored if it. Always smooth playing. You can lose hours to this game. Its relaxing. Thank you for a great game!! Also, this game doesn't need a face lift. I love that it hasn't changed since I was in highschool."", ""Fun game but the stats are broken. I can't see my previous scores. I have no idea how I'm doing. I tap on the places for my previous scores/ranking and something pops up and immediately disappears. Frustrating.""]"

My first puzzle was actually impossible due to the numbers. I was looking to try other Sudoku games because I've beaten my usual one and want more challenging puzzles but this one is a mess. One thing I like about my other app is you can skip ads by pressing the back key."", ""This is the best game I've ever downloaded. No annoying noises or animation, yet it's visually appealing enough that it's not boring. One REALLY big suggestion, though. PLEASE include a way to mark in a cell that a number is NOT a possibility.

There should just be a ""next"" button at the bottom of the screen. And there is no erase function to fix mistakes.', 'This app very nice app 👌 in this we can create our own Sudoku and play. In this many challenges Sudoku is their compared to another Sudoku apps it is best of best Sudoku I very played. Thank you developer for developing this wonderfully app for us. 🙏', 'I like this app compared to some similar because it usually tells you why it removes a candidate (hidden,crosshatch,etc.) On the down side sometimes it ignores some logic to go strait for a kill shot ( ie: this square is 5, but we cant say exactly why) , for instance I had to clear the candidates from a locked/hidden triple for it, as well as manually enter a hidden single it was ignoring. Other than that its a fairly nice app.', 'Great game with easy to use features. Love the fact that it compares your times to others and that it has such a wide range of levels.

Doesn't crash, so far. A bit clunky interface, but decent. Good app."", ""Nice and easy input. But.. where is the continuity of difficulty? One medium is easy 8 leisurely minutes, the next 45 minutes of head scratching how are they the same? Don't get me wrong, I'm enjoying this app but, where is the continuity?"", 'What I like least about this Sudoku is having to switch between full-size numbers (to add to the spaces) and notes (little numbers as reminders).

What I like best is the reports on time to completion, comparing my performance to past performances and to those of others.', ""The app permissions listed in the play store are reasonable. However when you download the app, in order to use it you have to confirm to their terms. This includes giving them access to contacts details (this is other people's info, not even yours to give away!), email addresses, PHOTOS, ip address, & all sorts. If you need to accept these in order to play, these should be listed under app permissions in the Google store. Very sneaky way to get access to almost everything on a users phone!"", 'Ads are ok. Ones with sound are not the app was removed due to loud ads popping up', 'Good game but there are unreal scores made by persons. I think they put the game in pause mode, resolve the game by other means and resume the game to write the solution. So there are people that resolves hard sodokus in 11 seconds only .... just to hit the scores...', ""This game was amazing for a long time but then started to open the play store and install other apps without my permission. It was really buggy and started to slow down my phone. I don't know what was going on but the problem was fixed when I uninstalled. I really want to find another app like this but all the others are terrible."", 'Hi guys, I loved your game for years but from the update I cant delete the old game I played and that force me to play the old game again and again. When I start a new game its always 1 of 5 different boards, no more different games but always the same games. I know them by heart now and that makes me board with your game. I hate the updated one. Its always the same 5 games nothing els. I wish I had the one without your update.', 'Perfect controls. Enough assistance. Ideal for those who like to handle challenges unassisted.', ""I like that it doesn't alert you if you have a number in the wrong place."", ""This is the best soduko app around. The most useful feature is the 'pencil planning' where the numbers are automatically removed when you solve related cells. I lost this app when I swapped phones and I have spent months searching for it again. No other soduko app comes anywhere close to this one for enjoyment."", ""I love Sudoku & this app provides easy play & configs. The classic is pretty easy on the eyes, but the dark version is not. It'd be nice to have a shade that allows play even on headache days when I need to clear my mind. Love the diff modes & levels of play!"", 'Liked the game. Just uninstalled. I can understand and live with the small banner ads. But this app now opens your browser without permission and tries to hijack your phone.

And before i even finished the video inthought I'd check it out (incase of spoilers) The game was under $2 so i thought why not, Chris know his puzzle stuff, ill give it a go... OMG ... I'm a huge fan now!!! Thanks to the maker's of this Awesome game & Chris Ramsay for the recommendation. Cant wait for more games! Please keep them reasonably priced thou. I'm a poorbie 😊"", ""I love this game! I don't usually buy games and stick with free. But I'd read that paid games are better in game play and graphics. I was not disappointed! I love puzzles but I've found I'm so bored with the available puzzle games these days. Everyone is all about match three or hidden item. But this! This gem is a true puzzle game. I will definitely be buying the complete series! Graphics are amazing. Game play is flawless. Just love it!"", ""Brilliant, thank you! Lovely graphics, music and atmosphere. No ads, no other added costs, just good gameplay. Pricing model is spot on - create a great game, give it away and know it's good enough that people will be happy to buy future installments. Which is exactly what I will be doing. Only con I can think of is the controls aren't always easy - the zoom in and out could do with changing. Seems that others have commented similarly, but this game is more than worth that niggle."", ""This game is the benchmark for what a mobile game should deliver. Great controls, immersive environment, creative writing and an overall engaging experience. Oh, and let's not forget.....NO IN APP PURCHASES! This, and every other game in this series is an absolute homerun! Keep up the great work Fireproof. You have garnered a lifelong loyal fan in me."", 'It is very solvable without clues. Just put the game down for 10 minutes, clear your mind, come back at a new angle. Do not forget to look at things that seem to do nothing on the surface with a way of looking under the surface. I just needed the first HINT on a few things to point me in the right direction without giving me the answer directly. Unlike most puzzle games, no answer left me puzzled as to how anyone could possibly connect clues to get the answer. Fixed income but buying the rest.', ""Downloaded because I saw Chris Ramsay's video on this game. It was worth every minute of play. Hint system does well to steer you in the right direction without making the puzzles easier or giving anything away. Definitely has a ton of replay value, as does the second in the series. Would love to see much longer games but still worth 5 stars."", ""I loved the game but some controls were hypersensitive, making some parts more difficult than necessary, but it was more of an annoyance than anything. It didnt detract from the fun of the game at all! It's too bad there isn't a free version. I would not mind watching ads for a game this good."", 'I enjoy this game each time I play it. The puzzles are fun and there is not a lot of running from room-to-room to finish them: only when necessary. The length of time required to finish it is different for everyone, but regardless of the time you invest, it is well-worth the wait. I hope these games keep coming!', 'Really makes you think and gets the brain working. You need a bit of patience at times but give this a go.It is not like any other puzzle I have tried.It gets the grey matter working.A lot of work has gone into this app. It took me a while to solve the chapters I have tried so far and I definitely needed the hints.This really makes you think out of the box!! Very imaginative and clever.', ""Incredible game. It took me about 4-5 hours to solve the game. You've definitely got me hooked on this one. I will definitely be getting the next one and playing them with my son to see how long it takes him to solve all the puzzles. I have to admit I did get stuck a few times and had to resort to the clues but it didn't detract anything from the experience."", 'I remeber when I first downloaded this game back in 2013. I was sceptical to spend money on an app seeing as apps were really just starting to be of a more popular brand. This game and all of its sequels are marvelous. Graphics, controls, gameplay, pacing are all wonderful. Not to mention the tone and environment is consistent throughout the entire game. This game series will always be my favorite. 6/5 stars.', ""11 stars! Packed, absolutely packed with puzzles. In each chapter. Each chapter has as many puzzles as some whole other games in this genre. I found myself in turns hating and loving the devs. I especially like the story, and how they don't let it interfere. They give you just enough story to let your imagination wander, as you're trying to solve the puzzles. Devious, just devious. But please, do not try this game if you get upset real quick about not figuring something out real quick."", 'This series is honestly the best Thrilling Adventure/Puzzle mobile game series ive EVER played on my phone !! Their so much fun to play and i cant find any other games similar to this series which REALLY SUCKS .-. but i really hope the game makers of this series release more games like this!! I definatley want to play more!!', ""It is a good game. And not expensive at a dollar, but a sort of easy and very short game. Wish we could get some new content without having to buy the new games. And not sure if I want to spend money on the newest games if they don't last more than a couple of hours like this one did. But it is an excellent concept for a puzzle game."", 'Best puzzle game EVER! My friend and I spent like 2 hours trying to figure out the puzzles and it was 2 hours of awesomeness! Too bad I dont have any more money 2 buy the 3 games including the 4th one. You see what I did there? 2,3,4 get it? But anyways thanks for creating this game because it is AMAZING! Oh, and the graphics are great! And now I am at 358 letters out of 500...including symbols and spaces. I am a Smart 7th grader and this took me like 4 days!Thanks for making this its cool! Bye!', 'Relatively new to escape rooms, but like puzzles in general. Gorgeously rendered images. Some of the puzzles are quite clever. A few, occasionally, are not that logical. But really nice atmosphere and overall, quite enjoyable and addictive. Worth a couple of dollars to play.', ""The room series are the best games in the play store. The sounds, the graphics, the challenges, and hidden truths to alchemy. I don't normally rate games. This game deserves it. When you play you will find that you exit the earth while you absorb yourself in the gameplay. I'm convinced that the actual creator of this game has some knowledge in the dark forces of sorcery. There was even a Stonehendge type set up. Don't take my word for it. NO POP UPS OR GIMMICKS."", ""Great game, some of the puzzles were pretty dang difficult but never too frustrating, the hints were very helpful but never flat out told you what to do so you're not being spoon fed the answer. Going to buy the next game right now!"", 'All the puzzles within the puzzles are rather fun. Some things are very difficult to find, but if you dont mind using the hints, they are quite helpful when you skimmed right past something earlier. If not, take your time.', ""Great game, I think it's worth the price. Graphics are a lot better than most mobile games, the plot is interesting and compelling, and the puzzles are a perfect level of challenging. The controls can be a little fiddly, but I think this is the kind of game your play if you like fiddling. The hints are great because they don't tell you the answer, but point you in the right direction. I love the occult-y storyline. It's a good way to spend an hour or two. I intend to get the sequels as well!"", ""This is amazing. I found this app because of Chris Ramasy's YouTube channel and it is well worth the download. If you are into puzzles and brain teasers this app is for you. I'm no where near advanced as some of the puzzle solvers I have seen but this kept me intrigued and wanting to keep moving forward even though I didn't know what to do next. Download this app because it is worth your time."", ""adore this game. I love mechanical puzzle games and I've never seen one as well done for mobile as this. while it is a little short, it's well worth the 99 cents I paid for it and the graphics are phenomenal, definitely buying part 2 👍"", 'WOW!!!! I am so impressed at the way this puzzle was ( very thoughtfully ) mind you,. Planned and executed! It is my pleasure to play such a well made Masterpiece! I search the globe for interestingly different and unique elements in all the puzzles out there and you finally have that creation! Bravo and Thank You! Keep up this wonderful work on', 'Hello people 👋🏻 I\'m really enjoying ""The Room: Epilogue."" I saved up Google Rewards to buy this game & I see myself purchasing more from Fireproof based on this experience. I\'m only moderately skilled in puzzling & found the game intriguing and challenging. The clue system is clever and rewards patience, frequently resulting in a gentle face palm for me. Some of the controls were not intuitive, so a minor knock there. Overall, this is a beautiful and well-executed puzzle game. Nicely done!', '""The Room"" is absolutely one of the best puzzle games ever. Albeit it has it\'s own weak spots. Amongst them is having excessive chest puzzles and less various riddles; unlike the Room two that has more liberal environment and variegated mystries. Likewise having a few levels is another problem which should be paid attention if there are going to be more spectacular puzzle games from Fireproof. Wish you a great future👍', 'The game has stunning graphics. Effort was visible throughout the game and leaves the users a good impression. It has the most challenging and creative puzzles I have seen yet. There are no bugs encountered although one major problem in the game is that the brightness keeps adjusting to low which is not suitable especially if I were to play outdoors. I would definitely buy the sequel for this. Must download for its worthy price.', ""I love this game and the three that follow after. These are the only games I have ever spent money on and would all over again. I wish I could have my memory of the game wiped just to play it over again. I still do anyways, it's so much fun and there is so much, it's easy to forget it all and redo it again with almost as much of a challenge as the first time. Hints are free, but the game makes enough sense to not need them frequently. I HIGHLY recommend this game!"", ""Such a great game. The puzzle boxes and the atmosphere are mysterious enough to keep you going. I passed on this game for years. Didn't realize I was missing out. I commend the developers. Great job!"", 'A-mazing Game literally! This game is very well made, the graphics are awesome. There is a great amount of time and detail put into this series. It is challenging and addicting. Absolutely worth the money, no adds. Just great mind boggling puzzles and a good story line .', ""This was a lot of fun!!! I only wish there were more chapters so I could keep going. This would be totally baller if it's available for VR! (I've chills just thinking about it XD )"", ""This was such an unexpected delight! I'd been searching for a good puzzle/escape game and this one delivered! I didn't know much going in and was pleasantly surprised by the occult theme! The puzzles are challenging but not infuriating, the story is creative, and the visuals are stunning!"", 'Caved and bought the game. One of THE BEST games I\'ve ever played on my phone. Controls work perfectly, challenging puzzles, and you can choose to use the hints or not. Def worth it!! Played every version of ""The Room"" games and they are all top-notch!! All are 5 star games!', ""The game is great when it works, but I don't understand why it's so hard to double tap something to zoom in certain spots. Some elements have time limits and I find myself fighting just to zoom in to perform an action. And it's not now and then, it's constantly fighting just to press the correct thing over and over. I really want to like it but it's completely unplayable."", ""This game is really great! Totally worth $1 if you like puzzles and escape type games. Superb graphics. Super smooth gameplay. Somewhat short, but it's high quality. Definitely gonna go buy all the other Room games by these folks. Nicely done."", 'So far I have only completed 2 puzzles but I am hooked. Best 99 cents I have ever spent. There is a guy on YouTube who finds complex puzzles and figures out how to open them. This game is like that but virtual and I love it. The ambiance created by the music is superb!', 'Thank god this game has consistently progress saving! Spet over an hour on this game disregarding the fact my phone was dying xD But loaded it back up and right were I left off. Thank goodness. It is a fairly addictive game and worth the $1. Kept me preoccupied so far😁 Looking forward to buy their new series. Might be complicated for some but they give you plenty of clues when you are completely lost.', ""Brilliant game if you puzzle solving and mystery. The music is beautiful and the gameplay is smooth and relaxing. Sound effects and 3d graphics make you feel like you're actually solving a real puzzle box. All the sequels are well worth the money."", 'This game is so awesome, really was wanting to start puzzling and was inspired by Chris Ramsey so when he showed this game I was pumped to try it out. 10 out of 10. The clues are in thought provoking not just the solution!', 'Beautifully made and very well built. The puzzles are a perfect difficulty to challenge but not make you rage quit. When you solve a puzzle it feels so rewarding! Will be buying the rest of this series.']"

I took over my daughter's game so had a little difficulty figuring it out. But I'm getting the hang of it and having fun."", ""Make no mistake from the 3-star review; I honestly love these games. I love puzzles that make me think and these definitely require you to use your brain, but some of these puzzles are convoluted and give you almost no way to figure them out on your own. In-game hints like to make absolutely no sense and then the optional hints eat up your stars only to give you SET hints on how to progress forward instead of a hint to get you from point C to point D. That feels cheap to me. However, those things I can deal with. Then there are the glitches. Sometimes you can't perform an action or set of actions that the game requires you to perform in order to move forward. Objects render unresponsive at random no matter how many times you tap or how thoroughly you tapped them. You wind up needing to restart the game in order to fix it, which starts you at the beginning of the level you were on. Then go back to the gameplay flaws I previously mentioned and you have a cheap, half baked mess of a game. The game can be incredibly tedious, but it's worth a good try for anyone who enjoys difficult puzzles. Regardless of these flaws, I still enjoyed my play through of it. Like I said, good game, beautiful art, interesting enough story and dialogue, but could use a little polishing."", ""Ive playes a lot of AEgames and i love the storylinea with the right amount of challenges.

Despite two warnings from Google Play because I installed on a (Samsung Tab A) tablet running Android 9, the app ran optimally. Finding and reading all the notes available in the game extends gameplay and causes the ending to make surprising sense.', 'Intriguing story, the biggest puzzle lies in the story itself. Otherwise easy enough for beginners, but also with some interesting new details for mire experienced players. All wrapped up in good graphics that provide a gloomy atmosphere.', ""Short but sweet mystery escape game. An involving story, if perhaps a little long with a tad too much to read. The graphics are atmospheric with some very unnerving sound effects at times that give the impression that you're not alone. Generally well put together with a reasonable price tag.

I was expecting at least 2-3 times this length. I was also disappointed to see the paid hints - really?? On the positives, the art is nice and the story compelling (although I detest having to read books in game). The atmosphere was almost scary - an excellent accomplishment for a mobile game! I enjoyed the puzzles and the flow of the game - for me it was perfect with a few exceptions that didn't make logical sense (why would someone cut a random painting?)."", 'I loved this game! There are so many fun little puzzles. The ending was super abrupt, though. It came out of no where and there seemed to be a lot of loose ends that were never tied up. How did the main character end up in the cellar in the beginning? Why were we kidnapped? Was there a symbolic meaning to leaving through a church?', 'This game was amazing! This developer is a master of incorporating story into their games and this one was fantastic! I kept playing wanting to know who I was and what happened!

This is a wonderful game & fun. This Eps was challenging & I was mad at myself 4 having to use a hint. It was much longer & it took me days to play it due to getting stuck & putting it down, then coming back to it. Reminds me of The Room 1, 2, & 3 which I 💓 as well. Keep these coming. $ is worth the fun. Graphics are great. Not enough games out there like this! We need more of these type of games. Keep 'em coming pls! ☺"", 'Unoriginal, lacks creativity, game play is redundant and the controls are too sensitive. This ""puzzle experience"" could have been achieved with far less expensive 2d graphics. Which could have - at least- sped up the tedious navigation. A Myst failure.

Wish the episodes were longer like myst though"", ""Been loving this game, but after I opened the first gate, everything artifacts and disappears. I can't see anything but the land, all artifacts and buildings are gone. Bummer. Running on a Nexus 9, so it's not exactly an old device. Will change rating if this can be fixed!  EDIT - The suggestion worked! Back to a five star for this fantastic and amazing series!"", ""FYI, using the double chevron to fast forward through the little roller coaster ride resulted in the car being offset from the track in the ice cave, so you can't get anywhere and have to restart the game. Playing on a galaxy note 5."", 'Significantly longer than XON 1 with more areas and environments.  This consumed most of my day but I was able to complete without hints.  Very well done, no bugs for me, looking forward to rest of series.', 'So reminds me of Riven and Myst I absolutely love this game. Massive thanks to the Developer and Google for the opportunity of playing Xon 2', 'Puzzles make even less sense than Ep.1, navigation no better. Unloading before finishing.', 'You get a lot of game for a few bucks.

I loved the first one so I got this one and it is great except for one thing: there is this one section where you have to go into a cave. The only problem is that once you get in the screen goes completely black. You can't see anything. I did not pay you guys $1.27 just so I could look at a black screen. If they fix this (maybe put some lights up?)this app is definatly worth the money. EDIT: Just found the lights in that cave lol. So yah, 5 stars! Worth the money!"", ""Episode 1 was much too short and basic for my liking. This episode is much better. Only issue: after taking ride into the cave, if you leave the cave and go back to take the ride back into the cave, the game doesn't allow you to follow the tracks. I have to exit the game and reopen it again to resolve the issue."", 'Took me a while to understand the objectives but thats half the fun. One thing though.

I quit playing it because it's impossible to finish my episode now."", 'Would give it 5 stars but do something out of sequence and your stuck.

Great graphics.', 'One of the best on Android. A really fun and challenging world to roam about & explore.  The Xon world is a believable story line and the puzzles are delightfully solvable by intelligence , not dumb luck.  Truly appealing to an engineering mind or a sci fi  fan. Excellent graphics, smooth and simple controls, no frustrations or glitches and a friendly & responsive creator.   Runs great on a tablet and would rival Myst on a big screen. Well worth the tiny donation requested..', ""Takes me back to good old Myst and Riven. There is a bug for me. Ride the tram to the maze,  complete the maze and pipes,  return to starting place of the tram, ride it again, the maze and tram are out of sync for me. Samsung 2014 tab. Love the game can't wait for the next episode."", 'Good that\'s longer than first episode. The puzzle quality is questionable, and few words as a ""storyline"" just look pathetic. Continuation between puzzles is not very logical and you might easily end up just wandering around tapping everything to see if something happens. Oh, and the bugs which can be only fixed by restarting the game?! Overall: not going to continue with next episode.', ""Awesome, genuinely great graphics. Not feeling the price tag for the length of the games, but I never do and these actually do something with the hardware we walk around with in our pockets. Four stars for length and nothing's perfect."", 'Once you go back through the tunnel the second time you are stuck. Awesome game, but going to make me request a refund at google.', ""I've been waiting for over a decade for another Myst/Riven type game. This is by far the closest to the original of those games I have ever found. Thank you so much for making this."", ""It took a bit of getting used to with no hints to guide you if you got stuck and I did have to have a sneaky look at the YouTube walkthrough, apart from that l thought this game was brilliant. I thought I wouldn't find another game as intelligent as the Room (and its successors) but I was was wrong, excellent."", ""Remiscent of the classic game Myst, XON drops you into a strange world with strange contraptions, and leaves you largely to your own devices. The ability to think critically, outside of the box is a must, but it's worth the effort. Episode 2 is arguably the most balanced and polished of the trilogy. It may lack the epic scale of Episode 3 (though it certainly isn't lacking in that regard either ) but it compensates with more consistent puzzles. XON is visually stunning and more than worth the list price."", 'Watch the walkthrough BEFORE you play the game wrong, get yourself STUCK, and are unable to finish the game.. in order to have the OPPORTUNITY to be disappointed at the way it ends!!!', 'Just difficult enough for me. Only downside is that it chews up power and makes my phone hot.', 'Thought there was more! Will go back and see if I missed somthing? But episode 3 here I come.', 'I love this game! Challenging enough to keep you thinking but not so hard you start to look for cheats. Smooth gameplay. This game is a great distraction.', 'This game was worth my $1.20 I anxiously await the next installment', ""Wished it had a longer game play ... I do have a question at the beginning of xon 2 there are somewhat like stone tiles some with arrows and others don't.is this another puzzle or just for show ......""]"

Great job and please make more of all of them.', ""Usually don't play these kind of games because the puzzles are extremely hard or they want real money at some point.

There are no directions so you spend a lot of time clicking everything to see if it's important."", 'I genuinely love this game. This is my second game from the Adventure escape series and I prefer this one to the Hidden Ruins one.

I wanted to solve that puzzle with the family tree but accidentally hit skip.', 'Was a fun game until putting the letter together and the ""skip"" for 25 stars is so huge i accidentally touched it since its in the part of the screen to put the letter together. So i used up stars to solve something i was not needing solved. Very poor placement of that. Was a huge interruption of the game for me and a waste of potential hint usage.', 'Still pretty good, but an oldie I think. The zooming on the puzzles makes me dizzy and some of the clues are really not very clear. Also the hints are not as useful as they are in more recent games. Fortunately all these issues are not present in the latest games (which are usually a solid 5 stars)!', 'Addicting!

I will edit my review if I figure this one out!!"", 'Nice variety of moderately difficult puzzles, however, it seems quite glitchy. I know what I need, but am unable to pick it up. Also, Back button and Skip are right next to each other, so I tapped Skip when I juat wanted to go back. Graphics are dated.', ""I would give this game more stars but the clues don't help. It gives you a clue to what you already know. For example as far as adjusting the emblem for the bird, it tells you that three rings move at the same time. Once all the rings are there you already know this. So it doesn't give you a clue on how to adjust it. They could tell people the flower goes at the top instead.

Got to a chapter where I knew the solution but the game had missed a step and not given me all the numbers I needed.

The visuals and graphics are superb. The levels are a bit challenging, means you have to click at the screen to get an idea about your next move.

Either the tasks are ridiculously easy n boring or too difficult or impossible to work out because the clues do not aid enough. And it will cut to the next scene when you haven't prompted it to yet. Annoying and frustrating. Also the dialogue between characters is not entertaining n pointless"", ""No instructions at all. The introduction is boring and doesn't make sense.

This game is easy enough that I want to play it, but challenging enough to keep me engaged. There isn't a time element involved, the game goes at my pace. The art work and color choices are a delight. And they add new mini games every week so there's built in variety. The game gives you a little ration of power-ups as daily and game prizes, but you can buy more if you really want to. I not only kept this game, I wrote a review."", ""I think the app is great. My problem is that I wish we could have more than 5 lives and I wish the levels weren't so difficult. Level 223 is absolutely impossible to pass. Plus I wish there wasn't a small amount of trys either. The levels are too hard to get through mainly because there aren't enough trys for you to finally pass it."", 'I love the fabulous illustrated graphics, the overall design and user interface friendliness, the color blind mode which sometimes is a nice alternative option, and of course that music which is a masterpiece of its own. True geniuses behind the development of this great game. Congratulations to the whole team.', 'Very fun. Stays interesting and challenging. Attractive colors and designs although the red backgrounds are a bit hard on the eyes. If you think you can\'t progress without purchasing, you probably just aren\'t that good at setting up squares for yourself. There is some strategy to planning future moves. I\'ve made it over 300 levels without buying anything and don\'t feel ""bombarded"" by purchasing options.', 'An amazing game! Most are the same when it comes to games where you have to connect three but in two dots you only have to connect two dots. I know it\'s not a big change but even the little things count when it comes to making a ""one of a kind game""! Also the music just ties it all together, the cherry on top! For this fun and calming game I would rate it 5/5.', ""I really like the game, though you do have to purchase powerups if you're going to get past levels. I love how there's always something else to do, it feels like more than one game. I wish the extra treasure hunt would come back, where you have to find all the items. I really liked that but haven't seen it since I first got the game."", 'The game emphasizes buying items too much. There numerous things to buy and they keep pushing them in your face. They also do a poor job of explaining the mechanics of the game. There is a progression, but they push you challenges and such that use things you not seen and your left guessing. Overall interesting concept, but poorly implemented.', ""It's a great game. Except I had to get a new phone. And since I didnt know to get a restore code or player id before hand I have to start over. I've never had that problem with any other game I use google play to sign in with."", ""I don't get why this game is highly rated the gameplay is similar to candycrush, expect you get annoying popups about anything and everything between and sometimes during levels. They also have the candy crush life system, which makes it annoying cause you might not get to play when you have time and of course purchase of in-game currency is advertised every other second and horridly expensive."", ""Fun addiction. There are a variety of challenges. Most games have been pretty easy. I am baffled by how to get to settings. Every time I tap what looks like the icon there are no settings available. I'm also confused about the objective for some games and don't find the explanations easily. The games I do understand however are fun."", 'Not worth the time.. Once you get to higher levels, the game has ridiculous algorithm at the backend. You play a game for good time pass. This one is certainly not. It keeps getting tougher to cross the levels when you cross 300. You have to use boost else you can not cross the levels. Using boost continuously means you need to spend money.', ""I really like the game but I wish you would give more than a second to read the message in between levels. There's one I've been trying to read ever since I started playing that starts out...playing for gold and high scores? No clue but I assume it tells you how in the next sentence. Others I haven't been able to read at all they disappear so fast"", ""Not as advertised. I clicked the download to play the game that was advertised. What's the point of the bait and switch? Why not just make the game that looked interesting enough to get people to click the advertisement? I tried a few levels and this game was not challenging or interesting."", ""This is the best designed mobile game I've ever played - from the anesthetics, to the experience, sound effects and humor. Everything looks and feels just in place, and new content keeps pouring in! Sometimes I open it just to witness how gorgeous it is. Seriously."", ""I really like the game but I'm not paying $4 just to access 50 coins that I supposedly earned while playing, that is just not happening and seems a bit outrageous. Also, please include a setting which allows me to turn off push notifications, or someone please reply and tell me where to disable them because I didn't see it in the settings menus and there are way too many."", ""My boyfriend and I have been playing two dots since we got to know each other..and that's like 1 year ago. Both of us loves solving puzzles and keep us calm. We also challenge each other to see who leads the game. I am at level 400++, never had to buy a boost. I watched the ads. And that will give me the boost that I need. For those of you who complained so much about having to buy boost, you guys just suck at this game."", ""Really love the game in general - keep up the good work. Agree with points made by others on social media that win streaks should be optional as they can take some of the challenge out of the game. Also why has the number of 'watch video for free life/booster box' seemingly now been limited to so many per day or certain times of day?"", ""Excellent! A very relaxing game, not bright on the eyes and the music is nice and calming. I suffer with Migraines that are generally caused by light. This game, by not having really bright features, has helped my find something I can enjoy, that helps me relax and I know won't cause me to have an attack. Thank you! 😊"", 'Games change on a regular basis to keep you from getting bored. In some cases though, the colors are just too hard to see or tell apart, e.g. coral and pink dots. I suggest more ""find the hidden objects"" without having to pay for the last rounds. I suggest you gain points to pay for play.', 'I got a notification saying ""breathe, it\'s time to play two dots"". If there is an app notification from two dots that would make me want to play this game again, it would be entertaining, appropriately impersonal. I spent the time on this review because the first image that popped into my mind was something like ""accidentally dystopian"".', 'Love this game, such cute graphics, very nice to look at and fun to play. I love when they have special object hunting games and I wish they would do then more often!', ""Love this game! There are so many levels and I love that they can get very difficult, so you have your fair share of challenges. It's my favorite game to play when I'm just relaxing or have any down time."", ""I loved the game, but now that I have a new phone, I lost my progress. Oh, I can save progress with Facebook? That's great for people who use Facebook. Here's an idea - this is an Android app. Use Google's platform to track and record progress, just like other games."", ""The recent addition of streak bonuses take the fun out of the game. Many boards just become stupidly easy, others become impossible, either way strategy is taken away. Used to be a balanced, semi-challenging game that was nice to play on the subway while listening to something, now it's just mindless"", ""I like the game, but when I click on the option to watch a video for an extra life or box, it just goes back to the extra life or box repeatedly. The video won't play."", ""I'd been looking for this kind of game and was so happy to find it. But it's become apparent that you really can't progress without making purchases. I think I'll just forever be stuck at level 55 because without boosts it's practically impossible. So :/ will be uninstalling"", 'Challenging yet fun, this game keeps your brain working in a way that is fun and refreshing. I love that when I connect through Facebook I am competing with friends scores without constantly being prompted to share or tag anyone or send invites. This is the least annoying game and no ads!! Love.', ""So much potential but let down. This game would be so therapeutic if it wasn't constantly hounding into buy coins and also, making it almost impossible on later rounds to proceed without paying."", ""Great game but can feel like a money grab. It needs better ways to earn gold as a lot of levels can't be done without the help items, and they cost a lot of gold and there's no way to collect that much gold without paying. I'd happily watch adverts to earn them."", ""A challenging game, with enough variety to keep you interested. Some of the levels are fiendishly hard, but with patience, if you keep playing, you ultimately get past them. The help function could be better, though. The explanations just aren't all that good."", ""Meh - Beautifully laid out and well made but far too pushy for in app purchases, with over 300 games on my phone right bow this is by far the worst I've play seen. Also no colourblind option of help so very tough for me to play in that sense."", 'It seems set up to make you have to spend money. When having to meet a specific number of color matches, it will stop giving that specific color or only give a couple. Its frustrating.', 'Of all the games that are ""just like this"" - this is by far the best one I\'ve played. It\'s kept interesting with frequent events and amny creative elements added in as you progress.', ""Just a fun enjoyable game all around. Although paying for the chest thing is kinda weird, but you don't need to for success!"", ""Not the game advertised. The game the ad showed had a stack of balls, 3 pegs, and you couldn't put a bigger ball on top of a smaller one. I clicked on it and got this crappy line game. Stop lying in advertisments!"", ""Would be a cool game, but it changes too quickly between levels to read the instructions or tips or whatever it is. Feels like I'm missing important info for that level. But I can't read it."", ""Could not get past level 35, it was a fun game, but the levels where there is fire are a timed event, and I don't like games that force you to complete them in a small amount of time."", 'Game itself is minimalistic and clean but nothing special. However I really admire all the artwork. I was just staring at all the moving doodles to the final level and it all was exceptional.', ""You can get pretty far without making a purchase but you eventually need to make them to get through certain levels. It's a fun mind-numbing game that awards you with freebies if you are willing to watch ad videos along the way."", ""My best friend and I love this game. It's analytical and has some strategy, but it also has cool colors and asthetic animations. The music is also fun and relaxing, and the game is split up so it's easy to set and achieve goals. 10/10""]"

[Update to previous review]: The ad-relatred issues I was experiencing appear to be resolved. Ads are very reasonable, and gameplay is satisfying."", ""Always had this game and always loved it but after the update before last, the game crashes after dev logo screen. It's been around a month now already."", ""The creators of this game are brilliant; however, I don't understand why it's so important for them to put emphasis on the fact that they're smarter than the players by making it difficult to figure it out. Some puzzles are almost defeating and unsolvable. Word of advice: after you've made moves that don't work, try moves you haven't made and you'll win. I don't quit until I win. Veteran players don't need hints just fair puzzles."", ""Legitimately my favorite time-killing app. I don't write reviews often, but this app stands out. 1) If you only have a minute to play, you can still enjoy the game without having to refocus your attention. Perfect for multi-tasking!!! 2) The ads aren't intrusive. They don't bother me. 3) It's not addictive, yet I don't get tired of it. 4) If I'm stuck on a plane with nothing to do, I can play this game for hours and not get bored. Theres even multiple play modes to make things interesting."", 'a very good app, only one thing annoying: quitting the game, does one really want to confirm the exit questions like ""are You really sure...."" what I would really like is a ""panic"" button, one click closing an app. addition: it\'s getting worse!l After the last update the app ""forgets"" which lavels have already been solved, starts from level 1', ""My phone heats up a lot while playing the game and battey drains a lot faster than usual.

Oh well."", ""It is so challenging! When you first get started it's very easy,but then it surprises you with a good time killing challenge."", 'Cool game, but recently changed autumn theme which was my favorite.

Just better graphics.', ""Used to be enjoyable, but now there's just too many ads. There's an ad after just about every other puzzle, to the point of it being very annoying and not worth it."", 'So i played this for the first time in awhile. Had to click a policy warning and then watched it attack my firewall more than 100 times. Deleted.

I hope this is fixed or I'll be forced to uninstall. I'm using Android 4.2.2 on a LePan TC802A tablet."", ""Until Monday last, I loved this game. No more. They changed the daily challenge from one new puzzle every day to a new puzzle 24 hours after you completed the last daily challenge. Not cool.

0h h1,com.q42.ohhi,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.q42.ohhi&hl=en&gl=us,"0h h1 is a little logic game that follows three simple rules:

- Three red tiles or three blue tiles next to each other in a row or column isn't allowed
- A full row or column must have as many blue tiles as it has red ones.
- No two rows are the same. No two columns either.

It's up to you to complete the grid without ever having to guess. Simply tap a tile to make it blue or red and complete the grid. 0h h1 gives you unlimited puzzles in four grid sizes: 

4 x 4
6 x 6
8 x 8
10 x 10

Each puzzle can be played in perfect Zen mode without any pressure. But you can attempt to beat your personal best time in the game's time trials, unlock fun achievements and compete with friends in leaderboards.

0h h1 is akin to Binary Sudoku, also known as Takuzu, Binairo or Binaire.
0h h1 is a little gift to you. We hope you enjoy it.
0h h1 can also be played on 0hh1.com.

Excellent and classy sound effects. FANTASTIC interface!! A+ for that.  The game play itself is interesting and a new idea to me. I would say that it's getting easier as it goes along though. Paradoxically, the more elements in the puzzle, the more daunting it looks, but the easier it is. You can finish many of the puzzles from level C onwards in one attempt, within a minute or two. It stops being a real challenge, and is now more of a task to complete.  Maybe as it goes on, it will introduce new types of elements, which will ramp up the challenge and interest."", ""Once you pop you cannot stop. Intriguing, yet relaxing. Well done.  The above was my review after testing the game out.  Now that I've completed it I have these questions - shouldn't the developers introduce more levels? The points on the game show 243/999.  Will 756 points need to be gained from the daily challenges?  Looks like a bit of an imbalance to me. Would appreciate feedback. Thanks"", 'I like the elegant interface. Easy to learn yet sometimes tricky to finish. Will keep you entertained for hours if you enjoy puzzle games. Only small adjustment (beyond ""more levels"") I\'d like to see is having the alphabet order reversed so that the most recently unlocked levels are always on top.

Its just very short. For 5 quid on a mobile device, I'd want more from it. The design of the features are detailed and inspiring. But I'm just going to harp on about how small it is. In context, a fiver on a game is quite a considerable amount. And the game is only a couple hrs long. More content please. Having said that I'm going to buy the next one."", ""This game was great until you got to the room with the typewriter and safe. The touch sensitivity doesn't work the way it should. On my phone, when you touch the typewriter or safe, it sound uncontrollably and you can't get to the letters as they spin out of control. Googled troubleshooting and nothing worked. Also seems to be a known issue. Hoping it's resolved soon."", 'Has been very much fun and makes you think, I am looking forward to #3 and #4 ""Old Sins"". I hope more will come after that. Any game that makes you use you brain is a good game as far as I am concerned. But these go beyond that by making the game look and feel like you just find it hard to put down and take a break. That is one sign of a very well made game.', ""So far, I've played 3 of the series. Started with the newest. But go in order. Just better. Not really a spoiler playing newest 1st, but you figure out the null quicker. On to #3 of the series. It will be sad finishing the series.. WELL worth the tiny price to pay. Hours of fun for the price of a beer. Make a 5th!!!!!!"", ""After the third try get the game to function, I finally could enjoy it. Some of the puzzles are almost too simple, but some are challenging and even delightful! So I changed my 1-star rating (when there was no way I could play) to 4-star. It seems that there are problems with the download and if you encounter any problems, just uninstall and try again. Without this issue, and because of the simplicity of some puzzles, it's not a 5-star."", ""This game is wonderful! Graphics are beautiful, story is captivating. The controls are somewhat annoying because of how often you have to zoom in and then back out but it's a very minor annoyance. This game is worth the money, each volume (whole game)takes roughly 4-5 hours to fully complete while each chapter can take 1 to 2 hours depending how good you are. Hopefully the third instalment is just as good as the first 2!"", ""I never pay for apps but the room games will always be an exception. Soooo amazing and super satisfying. Accomplishments much more rewarding when completed with hints disabled. I'm a big fan off puzzle boxes and logic games so as well as entertainment this game provides me with inspiration, as I'm attempting to make one of my own. Way to gooooooo Fireproof games!"", ""I have ended up play the room 2 out of sequence but having said that it doesn't seem to matter. I thoroughly enjoyed this game and it made the old (65yr old) grey cells work hard. I am off to play the others now. Keep up the good work. I recommend this game to anyone who wants a challenge."", ""Awesome graphics! Game overall is very good! Nice brain teasers! If it wasn't for some hints it would have taken much longer! (It took me few days to finish it) very nice though, looking forward to play the next one! ;) Hope we will have many more to come :)"", ""Brilliant, my only gripe is it didn't go longer! This series of games are by far the Best mobile games I've ever played! Please keep them under $5 . I definitely wouldn't have tried them if the 1st one wasn't so cheap! Worth every cent! PLEASE make more of these games!!!"", ""Touch sensitivity is out of order. I have no problems placing/interacting with most objects on my Pixel 4XL but anything that requires precision (e.g. dials, typewriters, etc.) is absolutely appalling. When I touch those things they would spin like crazy. This was the same with the first game but didn't affect me much. I'm now doing the chapter with the typewriter and I can't complete it because there is no way for me to type the words that are required because I cannot select the letters..."", ""Excellent game! Makes you think hard in order to find solutions. Please develop more, I would indeed purchase them. Who ever thought these games up has a high intelligence. Edit I've just played this game a second time, the last time some months ago. Its surprising how much one forgets the solutions. Thoroughly enjoyed it again. Time to purchase Room 3. Again thank you, it been a while since I played something that uses ones brain as opposed to the boring match 3 games that simply numb the brain"", ""Great, if occasionally infuriating, game! Really expands on the concept of the original Room with greatly expanded puzzles. Unlike before, the puzzles aren't simply with one item, but multiples areas in a setting. The controls are a little frustrating sometimes, yet not enough to take too much away from the experience. All in all really enjoyed playing, and completing, this game over the past ~3 hours and am looking forward to the next one!"", ""Chapter 4 (poker room) is glitchy. The clues (used all 4 in hopes it would let me skip) only tell me what I already know. Need to enter passcode to open the safe. But the dial constantly spins and resets. No way to go beyond this point. Google won't give refund. Had similar issue with typewrite (as someone else mentioned) but not as bad (was still able to complete task). Tried uninstalling/reinstalling. Didn't help. Deleted. Now wary of the other games in this series."", ""A fantastic occult-y puzzle/escape room game. This installment does a good job of fleshing out the plot from the first game, and is a great set up for the third. It can be more intense than the first one (I don't usually like things that get scary, though it's more thriller than horror), and I like how it explores different settings while remaining cohesive. Really amazing, especially for a phone game."", 'Challenging and lengthy puzzles that are well thought and keep you guessing. The game is well polished and looks and sounds great. Some puzzles are simply lengthy because it can take a while to find the switch or lever, others I found highly rewarding for persevering and getting through.', ""Absolutely loved how beautiful this game is. Played on One Plus 6t. When I thought I found a bug in some instances, it was actually part of the puzzle, and when reading some of the 1 star reviews, it looks like they might have had the same. Game play is fluent. Story line was absolutely unclear, could not follow at all, but I don't really care about that. Loved it, will play all fireproof room games."", ""I played the first on PC just recently and learned these were available on mobile. This plays very well! There were times I wished I had a bigger screen, and the drawer in the last level was really finicky. I can't wait to play the other two!"", ""Great game, but as many others have said, the touch controls are all out of whack. I played fine up until the Tarot card room with the safe dial. Can't spin the dial to lock in the correct letters, making the puzzle impossible to complete."", 'Not sure yet what to think! Loved the first one but the second one, on the ship I can not seem to get back to the treasure chest where the hint tells me to go. This seems like a big issue to me ! May try to restart the level ( though I would rather not ) and go from there ! If not, I want a refund for part 2 and 3 because I also purchased part 3. Will update review if I can connect again to the game. The original part one was OUTSTANDING!! Bravo to Devs!! Well thought out and executed. So we sha', ""Honestly, this game is just FANTASTIC! It is EPIC, FASCINATING, confusing as HECK sometimes (both puzzles and storyline), super mysterious and convoluted, and not just a little creepy (but that's part of the fun!😆) However, if you have kids who are sensitive to that, you might want to wait until they're older to try and play it. Of course, the best option would probably be to have you or their parents or guardians try it out first and then gauge it to see if this is something they can handle."", ""I loved the game but some controls were hypersensitive, making some parts more difficult than necessary, but it was more of an annoyance than anything. It didnt detract from the fun of the game at all! It's too bad there isn't a free version. I would not mind watching ads for a game this good."", ""It makes you think use your brain you think is gonna go one way and then the whole situation changes on you that's what our real game suppose to do it keeps you in suspense like you're suspended in air with out the noose tied around your neck The game is wonderful top notch don't look at the measly 2 or $3 I guarantee you the money is well worth it"", 'I highly enjoyed my time playing this game. This is the first of the series I started with and I can\'t wait to dive into the rest. Every puzzle I solved almost on my own but the times I did need a hint always gave me an ""OH. RIGHT. THAT"" feeling. Shaved off a good 3-4 hours off my flight too so that\'s a plus', 'An Excellent game and well worth the price. Exceptional graphics, gameplay is just as challenging as it needs to be, No annoying ads to distract you from the game. Will definitely purchase/play the next installment.', ""Not over hyping when I say it was awesome, challenging, beautiful, scary, tense and absolutely worth the price. I had to catch my breath sometimes (especially at the end) because I got so into the setting. The 'hint' feature works great, not revealing too much at a time."", 'The Room games have spoiled me. Now it seems most games are juvenile or boreing. I have all four of the games and completed two of them. It doesnt get any better.These games have captured my imagination like no others. Hey Creators more we want more...', 'Wow.. the puzzles are creative and challenging but not too difficult to the point of irritation. The graphics and cinematics are on point, and the storyline is quite interesting. Well done folks, TR 1 and TR 2 are the only games I have ever paid for and I think I have to get TR 3 now', 'Game is designed well an enjoyable, except for some game breaking bugs. Scrolling the typewriter is basically hypersensitive and getting to individual letters deliberately was horrible, but I got through it everytime. The hidden safe later is impossible and impassible. Hoping for a bug fix in the future, but without it, I bought a broken game.', ""I love everything about this game except their buggy controls. It was manageable in the beginning until the infamous taro card room when you try to turn the dial. Why isn't there a fix for this when everyone is experiencing this?!"", 'Really brilliant game. Beautiful, sumptuous graphics and a creepy atmospheres combine with puzzle solving that REALLY makes use of touch screen controls. It\'s short, yes, but think of the whole ""The Room"" series as a single game divided into chapters to make each of them mobile game priced. And there\'s no currency, boo microtransactions, no DLC - just a beautiful, Myst style puzzle game of clockwork boxes and intricate models', ""Absolutely one of thr best games I've played! The music was intense, the graphics were realistic and the puzzles were brilliant! I did not want the game to end. I've purchased The Room One. Two and Three. I look forward to many more. I had zero technical difficulties. Amazing game! Thank you!"", ""One of the best puzzle games I have found. The cost of the game is well worth the value. I much rather buy editions of The Room than all the in ap purchase other games make you use. It's like being in a multiple layered escape room with just a little creepy factor. Not sure there is really a plot, just good puzzles, but possibly the cryptic notes will make sense when I progress."", ""This is a really good game series. I normally don't buy games on the market but I am more then willing to drop the 1 or 2 dollars per game. This are fun and each one is better than the last. I'm going to go buy number 3 now."", ""Only criticism is the boat level was a joke and shouldn't even be considered a level. Also, wish the game was a little longer. Completed it in 4 hours which isn't that long considering it's pay 2 play."", 'Absolutely love these games bought the first one and played it then bought all 3 remaining at once so I could play them uninterrupted. My 14 year old loves them just as much as I do, and anything that me at 40 and her at 14 can both enjoy is amazing.', ""Freaking addictive! Worth the money.. all of their games. So well done. You can tell how much work went into these games. 50 out of 5 stars, you guys. Don't stop making these....because I need answers. 😂 I'm about to bring in the new year playing the third game lol ❤️"", 'Great game but often somethings are hidden and the controls dont allow you to see that view unless you are very precise about where you click making it sometimes hard to proceed in the game. Over all I enjoyed the game it wasnt to fast to get to the end but I did make it to the end without frusteration.', 'Very much had the feel of Myst. Enjoyed playing this though had to use the hints a lot because the hiding places for items can be very tricky. Glad there are games for us who like to slowly explore without tests of speed and dexterity.', ""These games are great, and have fantastic puzzles to solve. I've played one and two now and looking forward to getting three. There are sections that might be a little scary for some but not awful and not horror.""]"

-Bug Fixes","['I really might have not given the game a fair shake, thus I gave it 5 Stars. I am an old guy, so please take this into account, but the graphics could be a little better, but in the end, it was the core of the game that was not appealing to me, but you cannot fault the game over personal likes and dislikes, as it is has good software writing behind it, and clever at that. I scored it a five as I know the work that goes into a game such as this.', 'Absolutely fun, the only reason why I wont give i a 5 star is because i finished the game in a day. I would take watching ads for hints or watching 2 ads or more to unlock another level. It seems to short but I love the strategy and the noise they make when fighting and taking over planets. Overall great job!', 'Eh I played for a couple hours and it\'s very clear that they set the AI to attack the player constantly. You\'re constantly fighting 1v2, and can\'t really progress because you get steamrolled by 2 AI players who don\'t attack each other. And that\'s just on ""normal"" mode. Don\'t waste your time.', ""The mechanics are dreadfully slow and the A.I. prioritizes the player too often. There are instances where one regular A.I. sun somehow generates enough particles to fend off a steady stream of particles from two of the player's suns. Overall an interesting concept, but slowness and frequently restarting levels make the game tedious and frustrating."", ""Games cool, it has challenges to it, but the enemies can be overpowered, they'll sit there and ignore eachother after a minute and gang up on you and they have a higher growth rate than you because that's the only way they have a chance since they dont really have strategy."", ""I had a lot of fun beating this game, and it did not take too much time to move through it. I like tower defense games, and it helped me to think of this as a similar genre. Each map is a puzzle to be solved. Good times. Auralux 2 is also fun, and more challenging. I did not know a 3rd installment had been released until today. Also fun TD games are: 'Prime: World Defenders' and 'Grow: Empire Rome'. Both are winable without pay-to-play, but both also include pay options."", ""While I would have to classify this as a Real-time strategy game, Auralux plays differently from any other game (out of many hundreds.) I've seen. The pace is slow and methodical, yet a moment's hesitation or a second - guess can cause a chain reaction of failures that might lose you the round. The controls, while simple, can cause a bit of frustration at first, but may be learned quickly enough."", 'Great game! Super fun and scratches that RTS itch quickly and easily. The game surely is a challenge at times and is just a load of fun.', ""The pace of this game is a huge problem. After purchasing speed mode, I found out that you can't really gauge the speed, aside from either Saturn V quick or constipated sloth slow. What really sucks is that you can't switch the speed mid-game, so no using fast mode as a tool to break up the tedium. It's a simple problem, but one that takes a lot of enjoyment out of the game."", ""The game itself was really cool such as the concept and even the tutorial and making it through the easy level. I managed to beat one of the medium levels but after that, I felt I was constantly overpowered by green in particular, where red would overstep and then green would attack me and then they'd both be attacking me. Kind of frustrating on that front. Also very slow paced. Not bad just not something I was expecting"", 'nice game, grabbed it because I was looking for an osmos clone, this is very different and actually harder. a very good game in is own right.', ""Exactly what it says on the tin. The very core elements of RTS, so it's easy to observe fundamental, somewhat paradoxical concepts of game theory emerge."", ""If you want a time killing basic RTS for free this is a simple one. A lot of better maps and content through purchasable DLC. If you like the demo a bit then getting the DLC would be recommended for more in depth play. Wonderful, I would rate 5 however I haven't touched this game in a while and figured this amazing time killing little game deserves a review. Also I'd suggest being able to comprehend a basic RTS before playing otherwise you may not enjoy it. Try it free."", 'Addictive and fun but frustrating and annoying. Needs speed control not just dreadful or insane. Also how many enemies and online games would be good.', ""Honestly, it's an excellent game when you just think of how simple the controls and concept are. The controls could use tweaking to smooth it out, but that won't stop me from playing."", ""This is a hard game but a very cool game download it and you'll be amazed sub a hard sub easy and I know I really like the hardwoods but I really love this game five star rating I love it if I had to I would wait a text us 10 Stars I use a microphone in really does it work I love it really fun game I love it my microphone doesn't work anymore I got to get a new one Lego game this is a hard game"", 'Good theory, not great execution. Too many ""insane"" levels. Not enough open ended games. Wish the maps were larger. Too bad, could easily be better.', 'Very nice game! Even needed to try the second level about 5 times before winning it, so can be hard at times, but I love a strategic challenge.', ""Pretty... and pretty frustrating. I guess I'm an idiot, because I can't get past level 2. The two AI enemies never seem to actually be aggressive to each other, but BOY will they double team you if you make even one over-extension. Perhaps it's more fun as just a fidget toy, but as a game... not so much. Worse still, the AI has a precision of unit selection that you can never really match without a lot of finicky zooming in and out. I wanted to like it I cannot better things to do with my time."", ""Free-for-all AI players will band together to kill the human player without attacking each other, regardless of their proximity. I've tested the AI before by controlling every star on the map (around 10 stars for me), bar 2 stars for the 2 AI players (they had 1 small star each). The AI stars were next to each other and my surrounding stars were reinforced with 30 minutes worth of produced units, made by every other star on the map (my stars were unbeatable) and THE AI STILL ONLY ATTACKED ME. 👎"", ""One of the most enjoyably difficult games I've played in a long time! Relaxing, yet cool. Great sounds and visuals too!"", 'A rarity, an actual game, one of my very few purchases. Hats off to the devs/publishers for bringing a quality product, which is a almost impossible find on gplay.', ""I originally played this game in 2014, and found it again recently, still as enjoyable as the first time, it's very relaxing and surprisingly engaging if you enjoy micro strategy games"", 'An excellent strategic RTS game that is also very relaxing to play. The key strategy is to occupy the empty orbs near you and allow one of your orbs to continually produce blips and then send a massive array of these blips to take out the main orbs of your opponents and stop production of their blips at their bigger orbs while still defending your own orbs. Once that is done you can attack from multiple areas on their smaller orbs and win the game. Would be nice if the devs had a replay option.', 'First level hint is ""Let your enemies fight while you build up strength"". Regardless of what strategy I take, both green and red attack me on a staggered pattern and ignore each other. I die no matter what.', 'Great game, had a tun of fun, only thing I wish they had was more free levels. I bet some levels were labeled wrong, hardest free level byfar was the triangle level. Still loved this game.', ""Not necessarily a bad game, per se, but the fact that it feels like I'm playing in slow motion destroys any enjoyability for me."", 'So far this is a really good game, I enjoy the soundtrack and the game sounds. It is simplistically beautiful to play!', ""Love the Game. A slow paced relaxing but intense strategy game. Haven't played it in years but beat a hard level first try. I'm pleased"", ""I'd like to see more mechanics, some powerups maybe, something to spice up the game. Right now it's a little bit too slow, the music/sound is a nice touch."", 'I really like this game, it involves a certain level of strategy where you just CANT succeed by spamming butsimple enough to where you can pick it up quickly', 'The game is graceful and easy to play, but occasionally I make a mistake and the game gets me back! I enjoy it', 'On some levels the suns pour out like water. Can you tell me how one can keep up a ""flow"" like the other colors do? Oh yeah, I\'m on nova mode too.', 'I liked the style and strategy of this game a lot. I recommend it to people who love tactics, including chess players!', 'It\'s not bad, but it\'s not good either, there\'s much better games available with the same idea, where you attack other ""sun"" (planets, towers, etc) and have to collect more... There\'s no concept of who\'s in the lead nor when your dots will arrive. I don\'t recommend this', 'Too slow. You can speed the game up by paying money but off to a bad start due to how slow it is. Cant reccomend the game', ""Cool casual game. They should add more levels. Ignore advice for level 3. It's exactly the opposite of what you should do."", 'I am giving this game 1 star because it only allows for a speed up option to be purchased. This was not the case years ago. I loved this game then. Now it takes 10-20min to beat 1 level. No thank you. Uninstalled', 'Interesting strategy game. It can be very absorbing.

Enjoy!","[""I downloaded this game just to try out something new for myself and now I'm into it! I love that there are a few maps which I found it a bit complicated but then turn out to be really simple, if you just CHANGE THE WAY YOU LOOK AT IT. It's a relaxing game, meanwhile you can still practice your brain, but more than just that, it helps me to look at life differently. Thank you!"", ""It's absolutley amazing you can use it anywhere; everywhere at any time you like. I've had this game for a while now and I am only just reviewing it as i have found no flaws at all. Awesome. I guess it is for ages 7+ as i think that children under the age of seven will not be able to process the fact that it is a dot to dot but it is in the form of pixels on your device. I also think that it 's background can be varied in different patterns and colours as it is boring having just the same thing."", ""Game is decent but the ads, ads, ads, ads, ads, ads, ads, ads, ads.... Most game levels only take seconds to complete, though occasionally there's a head-scratcher. So you end up with ads several times a minute! And many of the ads will automatically open playstore no matter what you do, so really you'll quite likely end up spending more time fighting off ads than playing the game. I don't mind reasonable ads, we all gotta pay the bills, but come on guys, this just ain't cool."", ""It's a fun game, but theres too many ads. They play pretty much after every 1-2 levels. This is one of the least user-friendly games I've ever played. Also theres an ad that's plays whenever you want a hit that closes straight away and you cant get another hint ad for some reason. You just have to sit through an ad without a hint. Very disappointing experience"", ""This game is so elegant and relaxing that it is the only one I've redownloaded and given 5 stars. The sheer number of puzzles is impressive, and the varieties of sizes and types keep Flow entertaining. My only criticism is that the difficulty of the puzzles plateaus despite increasing grid size. I'm solving most of the 10×10s in under a minute each, but still enjoying the game overall. Well done!"", ""Haven't played Android version, but played it all the time on my Kindle when I was 5 or so. I love the game. And to all the people complaining about ads, use the magic trick of turning off your WiFi on the device. Boom, no more ads! Just make sure you're saved to the WiFi address so you can get back on when needed."", ""Did rate it 5* but recently they've added a ridiculous number of long unskippable ads - they're every 3 games or so, which is usually less than a minute! Was such a good game but it's basically unplayable now :( EDIT: Seem to have stopped the unskippable ads again so back to 5*! Seriously addictive game, challenging enough to be interesting without being so hard it's frustrating!"", ""A really good puzzle game that I have spent many hrs playing, so good that I paid for the extra levels and I don't normally pay for anything extra, I have played the other Flow Free games and enjoyed them too and I like the challenge as the levels get harder and would recommend this to anyone who's searching for a really good puzzle game 👍"", ""Fun and extremely challenging! I feel like this game really gives my brain a challenge so it can improve and grow. It also includes strategy and major thinking. Please at least try this game out before judging the game by comments/reviews and try this great game! It doesn't even advertise itself which also makes it a great game! Nothing in my opinion is wrong. It also infrequently gives out ads. I will at least watch add for the sake of this great game, AMAZING JOB Big Duck Games LLC!"", ""I'm giving every person that considers buying this app a heads up. Your progress will be synced between devices, but not your purchases. So buying an ad free version on your android phone, and then logging into the play store will sync your progress. However, buying the ad free version doesn't transfer to your other android devices. If you want to play this game ad free you will have to pay $4.99 for each android device."", ""It's a good game to play when you have nothing to do. There's not alot of ads wich is great for most people I personally didn't mind the ads. I only rate 5 stars because I've been playing this game for 2 years now and I've gotten really good at it."", 'This app updated on 15 January and since then it has really not performed upto its previous 5-star standard. It always freezes on opening and sometimes during, which had not prior to this update. The daily challege also changed in this iteration. The first challege is unlocked dut each successive one remains locked until the prior one is completed. This is not a positive chage for those with attention issues. Please undo these changes and I will change my rating to five stars.', ""Played this game like couple of years ago and found it enjoyable and decided to get it again and there's just TOO MANY ADS NOW!!! its ridiculous because it just ruins the whole mood I understand that there needs to be ads but its just too much that i cant justify playing it Youre literally watching ads for a longer timw than youre actually playing the game"", ""Played this a few years ago and loved it. Now the ads are just unbearable. 30 second ad every 3 or 4 levels. Wouldn't mind a short ad every 10 levels or whatever but this is just annoying. Feels like they're trying to force me to pay to remove them."", ""I've enjoyed playing this game for years now, and remain a fan of the gameplay. The daily puzzles are challenging without being too difficult and the included games are numerous and stimulating. Most content may be purchased for $2 to remove ads. I play daily and find it to be a great stress reliever and solid way to keep my mind active."", 'This is a great game however I cant afford to give it a higher rating due to the fact that the ads are incessant. They are absolutely relentless. They pop up in the middle of levels, after every level, and everywhere in between. It completely and utterly ruins the experience.', 'Relaxing, fun, and enjoyable, this app is perfect for all ages! Simple for kids (no offense), and stragetic for adults! I recommend it for anyone who wants to find a good app to play in their free time.', ""So I looked at the reviews and saw too buggy, too many ads, ect. But here's the thing. They say it's ad free with no in app purchases and not only does it have ads but it also has in app purchases so we literally get lied to before even playing the game"", ""The game itself is fantastic and my favorite offline game! I highly recommend. However, recently I have been getting ads with sound that can't be muted or closed which means that I can no longer play in public without headphones. I'd rather stop playing than be cornered into paying for the ad-free version."", ""In 2014 my neurosurgeon saw me playing this game and recommended it along with any problem solving puzzles and games. I had just had an aneursym clipped. Not only do I find relaxation while playing I'm also exercising a part of my brain that was damaged."", ""The game is already ad supported, but each new update ads a higher frequency of ads appearing. I used to be able to finish 10-15 levels before an ad, now I get one every 2-5 levels. I was willing to pay the $4.99 to purchase, but user experience is so poor that I'm reluctant to give the money. It feels like the makers are making the game unplayable to force you to buy it or else make a bunch of money by crushing you with ads."", ""Awesome game, probably my number one game! I'm actually a freelance brain surgeon and thanks to this game I'm finally making ALL the right connections, no more goofballs from me! This game is better than most brain-type games, I've paid to unlock all packs but you should have a donate thingy as well, I don't need to buy the hints, I'm a lawyer remember. Highly recommended! Please make another with, I dunno, time travel and goats? All my friends here at NASA would love that... to turn back time."", ""This used to be a fun game. Now they have an advertisement after nearly every puzzle. To make matters worse the advertisements are timed so you have to view the whole ad. Very frustrating!!!! Don't waste your time on this one."", 'This game makes good use of the touch screen is very easy to learn and some levels are a bit challenging. One complaint, after completing several hundred levels the app crashed and despite using ""play games"" after reinstalling I had to start from scratch. Possible improvements, a head to head mode, ability to play user selected music in background and the obvious removal of ads. At least not so many.', 'Super fun and addictive. Simple to use and understand. Plenty of modes and very few ads which is great, overall just an enjoyable time waster (in a good way)', ""I have each Flow Game installed & love them all. But THIS is the One: inthe starter pack, as u learn it gets harder. After, there's many packs to get harder or not: many options, perfect! This one also intros the other Flow games (Hex, Warp, Bridges etc) for ur next move! Last: Ads exist for a reason (dev support). Before PlayPass, I happily paid a small sum to remove ads & support the team. This is worth the try: Play It!"", 'I enjoy this game. I believe it is helping keep my brain sharp as I continue through the aging process. The more puzzles I complete, the faster I am able to move through the packets. Thank you.', 'Very fun game!! It makes you think harder and is very fun to play!!! Ads are very tame and do not pop up as much as you would find in any other apps. I give all 5 stars, to this amazing game!! I will for sure be playing more of this fun game!', 'Ads! Ads! Ads!!!! another victim of greedy developers, forcing you to watch ads every 1-5 levels. beautiful game, destroyed by ads. If you dont mind exiting the game and re-entering every 2minutes, play it.', 'BEWARE !!! You will never be able to have a perfect Achievement status if you make mistakes. After years of play, I achieved all games as starred perfect packs, but not so in Achievements. The unpublished rules don\'t allow for human error or striving to be rewarded for correcting mistakes for stars. Publishers quote.....""There is no way to change those checks to stars -- that is just the way the achievements were designed.""', ""Let me say I love this game, it's calming in fact. I know there is ads, Im fine with ads, but I am not fine with a ad in the middle of my time trial. There should be no ads during a time trail, I extremely hate that, thats why Im giving it a 1 star."", 'Having to watch a 30 second video ad after every level is ridiculous. Especially when puzzles are completed in a couple of minutes, you spend more time watching ads. DELETE!!!!', ""LOVE this game. The game itself is 5 star. The free version has SO many ads it's no longer fun to play. If you buy the game for just a few dollars it may be better."", 'I had to uninstall it after two days..... . Every second time you play, they show you an advert. If you play the game twice, you have to watch a 1 minute advert video. Its annoying!!! . Game is not bad, but boring and too many adverts.', ""Fun game that offers a good bit of entertainment. The levels in the first few packs are pretty easy but they do get challenging as you get to the 10x10's"", ""I love this game it's my favorite not to many ads, fun daily challenges,and its simple, (in my opinion that's good) and I really hope they don't do to many updates and ruin it like has been happening with all my other games."", 'This game is best offline game.but i have completed all the levels and i need more level because in my job i get off and during that i get board got so i request if possible launch new pack in a 2 weeks or atleast a month. By the way the game is awesome and i really enjoy this game thank you guys.', ""Fun. But the UI needs a little work. The hint button is easily hit, and there's no confirmation - so your three free hints are easily wasted. But, I guess the developers are trying to train us to not to buy tips? -\\_(o.O)_/-"", 'Ive played this game everyday for nearly 2 years. Yesterday it just decided it wouldnt open anymore!! Its challenging and fun but im really upset over not being able to keep my daily score going.. its lost the review 2 stars', 'Love this app, one of the most relaxing ones out there.

Thank you all for the continued support. Remember to rate and review after each update. We read everything you write so your comments and feedback are invaluable!","[""I love puzzle games in theory, but most of the ones I've tried have been too simple to be enjoyable. That's not the case here -- this is a uniquely challenging game. Some puzzles are straightforward, but a lot of them really made me work for it. That said, there's not a lot of wiggle room if you get stuck and many of the clues aren't very helpful. I've had to resort to walkthroughs on a couple levels, which is super frustrating -- a puzzle isn't much fun if you need the answer handed to you."", ""Puzzles are too easy and one-dimensional. Maybe it gets harder as the game progresses, but the developers asked me to review it this far in, so I can only judge this far. It's very easy. The puzzles are just a rotation of the same 4 codes, with some other equally easy puzzles mixed in. If there's only one clue per puzzle to interpret, and only one way to respond to it, then it's not a puzzle, just a clicking adventure."", 'Amazingly detailed and thought provoking. Got to think outside the box but not too far or you may confuse yourself. Sometimes the simplest solution works. Great mystery weaved into the puzzles making this my favorite game of this style. Great job!', 'To this day, The Guides, Axiom, and Compendium are probably some of the best mobile games ever released. The graphics and detail in every aspect of this game is simply jaw dropping. Each stage of the game is filled with beautiful details that only serve as a red herring, putting so much into simply distracting you. Some of the later puzzles make you feel like Einstein when you solve them, and that kind of sensation is something that the puzzle game market is lacking at the moment. Outstanding.', ""There are many cheap 'Puzzle' apps that are mass-market, quick-buck, with little care for quality. THIS IS NOT ONE OF THOSE APPS. This is the kind of stuff you seek out when you're training your brain for escape rooms, or day long puzzle competitions. The presentation, the context clues, it's all wonderfully atmospheric and well put together. Downsides? Well, the UI could use a little clearer description or guidance for the 'help' tools' use, but that's about it. EXCELLENT job."", ""This game is wonderful. So well thought out, intriguing, difficult yet addicting. Keep more of this coming and I'll gladly pay"", ""Absolutely wonderful. I've been playing for an hour straight. It's well thought out and well made. The devs hit a home run with this one."", ""This is a fantastic game to while away time - be warned though, you'll have to put some thought into the various puzzles, but in the end it's worth every excruciating second!"", ""Every solution leads to a new problem. Sometimes there are multiple ways to solve problems. The best part is the fact that everything you need can be found in levels you already completed or at some point will, you just have to be resourceful, perceptive and patient. This is the kind of game most people I know wouldn't play, a game that makes you think and experiment; I love it."", 'very good overall. puzzles challenging, but generally fair. some outside knowledge proved helpful in sequel, but this seems slightly better in that regard. many more red herrings, though, it seems. some pages seem to offer absolutely no clue, until you spot the one tiny element you can make sense of. be aware, you may have to look behind the page to find it.', ""Absolutely top-notch visuals and a good ambient soundtrack create an incredibly immersive puzzle-solving experience. While the interface is a bit confusing to navigate and the deciphering may feel a little tedious at times, the overall production quality is perhaps the best I've seen in any game on the app store. For those hesitant to spend $3: A) The game is quite lengthy, so lots of content. B) Play the first few levels of the sequel. It's free, and gives you a good idea of what to expect."", 'A great puzzle game for those looking for a unique experience. The guides is a puzzle game that forces you to really pay attention to your surroundings because the answer is always there sometimes you have to dig a little deeper than the surface but this game is completely worth your time if you are looking for a puzzle game that actually makes you think.', ""Brain candy!!! I have very few words to describe this game the way it deserves, but it is awesome and am happy with my purchase! Guides Axiom is next. You are SO generous to give that one to for free! It's even longer! I wanted to support your development so I bought The Guides Compendium book. I just started reading it and it's a nice compliment to the games. Please make more games. Your genius is refreshing. Nothing else is like The Guides in the whole Google Store! 👍"", ""I downloaded this after playing Axiom. I've really enjoyed playing both games, solving puzzles that link to levels outside of the one you're playing adds a good depth to the game too! the UI for calculating and entering answers is poor in a lot levels because you need to be able to view the puzzle and the input interface at the same time; the view is often obscured my the input and I rarely use the interface to solve puzzles, resorting to online binary calculator or cipher shift resources."", ""I really am loving this. The puzzles are complex and rewarding when finally solved... Even when you're confused on how you solved them or how the hint was helpful. :)"", 'A very challenging and beautifully designed game. Head scratching all the way!', ""Lots of fun but I do find I need to cheat and look online once in a while.. \U0001f92b love how there are so many different types of puzzles. Very different than anything I've ever played but HIGHLY recommend it!"", 'This game is such a amazing puzzle game and if forces you to think. Im a person that can solve larger puzzle games in a short period if time but the roughly 100 puzzles here took me a very long period of time to solve. I do believe that The Guilds is worth the price and your time.', ""This is a great game. It's not always easy. Very cerebral. The game just used that word. I think it fits. It's a math-centric logic puzzle game. But don't worry, it gives you special calculators. Lol"", ""this game and it's sequel are so captivating. once you start solving the puzzles it's almost impossible to stop. I can't recommend this game anymore. this and it's sequel are a MUST PLAY"", 'A fantastic game and wonderful brain exercise! I will say I needed help in more than a few levels and the last couple were down right impossible for me to solve. I harvested information from more intelligent people and enjoyed the experience very much! I look forward to axiom!', 'It was interesting to begin as well as confusing. There are no instructions you just jump right on in. So far the puzzles are logical and solvable with the visual clues you get. Pretty cool.', 'Very clever. Genuinely makes you think, and certainly not your average puzzler.', 'tricky puzzles and a very ambiguous story that as it unfolds leaves you with more questions than answers. I hope the story fills out more soon, having only completed section one. Fans of submachine and the abandoned series, this is a must play', ""Nicely conducted and paced, the puzzles are sometimes simple and someone's not, and it might take several trips back to see your way through. Highly enjoyable and highly recommended."", 'I love this!!!!

Puzzles keep me thinking, but some of them seem to be really out of the box. I'll need to change my perception."", ""This game makes you think in different ways, like in one level, you get a new tool, but the game doesn't tell you, you need to find different ways to solve problems"", 'challenging puzzles, an interesting back story that you slowly unravel, great atmosphere, this is an awesome game!', 'The learning curve is strong with this one.

Sounds and music fit perfectly. The detailing and camera direction at the start of levels is such a nice touch that it makes it masterpiece in my opinion. The opening scene of Lv 3-12 is my personal favorite. The game is so simple aesthetically but detailed as well, it's a refreshing offline game with no pay to play mechanics at all. Needed to use only 3/5 free hints to get all 27 achievements, which are good in that they don't need you to grind. A 10/10."", 'Got this game on sale for $0.99, but I feel that it would have been worth it even at the full asking price. The mechanics are very simple, but the puzzles are complex enough to keep you interested. And for the completionists out there - each level has different challenges, such as no kills, kill everyone, maximum number of moves, retrieve a briefcase to bring to the the exit, etc.', ""I have mixed feelings about this game. I really like the concept of this 'GO' type of games. It's simple and intuitive....However the glitches really bug me especially when during the transition of camera's perspective! Don't get me wrong, the graphic is amazing, but the glitches really put me off... I decided to uninstall the game.... :("", ""This a solid and attractive puzzle game that is occasionally challenging. It has one serious flaw which is why I gave it 4/5: On most stages, it's deliberately impossible to get all 3 objectives at the same time. This is deeply unsatisfying and means you beat the level and then have to do it again - usually without any significant additional challenge - to get the last objective."", 'This is one of the best casual mobile game which I have played. This has a board game type feel yet it packs so much enjoyment and gameplay experience in it that I really want to play more of this even after finishing the game. I have given it 4 stars because the game is relatively short and in the end you really wish for more of gameplay or new levels.', ""Love the boardgame plastic pieces effect, fits so well with the hitman asthetic making it seem like a 50's style game but out of time. Puzzles are pretty hard but fun and eventually doable as you have that eureka moment. Only issue was cant sign in to google play for achievements or cloud save. If I wanted to uninstall to play at a later date I would always be starting over. Love games with movements as the puzzle, its simple but complicated as more mechanics throw in. That makes them so great!"", ""A nice puzzle game. The only thing I don't like is that you can't clear save data. The button is there, but as soon as you clear a level, it will have shown all the levels cleared."", 'I love the game. It was challenging, but I managed to finish all the puzzles and got all the achievements. Wish there would be more. Love the game.', ""Hitman Go is an amazing app. For only 99 cents, you get tons of challenging, almost impossible levels that can be completed in multiple ways. This is a board game version of hitman, so don't expect to shoot people and hide bodies. The visuals are very appealing and I often found myself pondering on how to complete a certain objective on a level."", 'As a long time fan of the Hitman series, I\'m actually impressed with this game. I remember thinking ""what the hell is this?"" when I first saw gameplay. But I\'m glad I actually bought it whilst it was on sale. Really challenging gameplay with recognisable mechanics from the triple A titles, just on a table top themed setting. If you\'re a fan of the Hitman series, or just a fan of the stealth action genre in general, definitely give this a go.', 'Fantastic. In my opinion, the sounds (music and sound effects), the artwork, the variety of enemy types and items, the number of levels and level packs, and so many more features combine to make this incredible masterpiece. You can definitely see the love that was put into the creation, what a wonderful experience it was to play this and I am upset that it is over. If you have not tried this, I recommend you consider it. I have not played the standard hitman series, but I reckon I now should.', ""If there were any word better than 'best', that could describe it. It probably the bestest logical game ever made. Outstanding!"", 'Greatest puzzle game!!! It made me think outside the box in a whole new way!!! I would totally recommend!!! The soundtrack is totally intuitive and it gets your mind into a relaxed zone. This game is perfect to sharpen your brain and help pass the time if on a trip or break. This is the best puzzle game i have ever played hands down.', ""Decent puzzle game. I picked it up after completing Tomb Raider Go which is a superb game. I recommend playing that first, and this one if you can't get enough of that style."", 'Good, challenging, worth the dollar and half I spent on it considering the multitude of levels it contains, the music also puts well in the ambiance. Being a huge fan of the series, I totally recommend it.', ""It's a very fun game it keeps me engaged and interested and it helps the time go by when I should be working and helps block out the pain from my brother doing heroin"", 'Should make for a good game to pass the time waiting for the bus. And while on the bus. And when i get home. Basically all the time. Wish there was a directional pad for moving instead of having to stretch my thumbs across the screen, especially when the controls are so simple. Still a good game though, worth the pound.', 'I think this game got something to do with it. should adding more weapons, object interaction, give more than 10 ways to do assasinating in every single chapter, sound effects, soundtrack background. (If they do add and fix it people who playing this will excite it) ""this is my idea considered to improving the game with my an opinion only""', 'Best game I have ever played. I was big fan of this game on my PC but recently I have started playing it on my android and trust me you will love this game, especially its background music. This game really helps me increase my concentration and relaxing my mind. You will experience Dopamine level boosted in your body.', 'Great little strategy game. Keeps your gears turning and requires you to think. The music and ambience are very relaxing as well, and the game has very charming art within.', ""I've loved the Hitman series from the beginning. I also love board games and puzzles. This just meshed it all perfectly."", 'Great puzzle board game from a beloved franchise. Good game definitely worth the try.', ""I played Lara Croft Go first and needed a fix of more puzzle. Only gripe is that the camera doesn't always cooperate with showing the best view of the board. But otherwise a great little puzzle game with a nice, distinctive aesthetic."", 'Very nice departure that still in many ways stays true to franchise. This was a very welcomed fresh take on one of the best game franchises ever conceived.', ""It's ok. Gameplay is rather boring, and there are a few bugs. Every time to start playing it automatically takes you to the next chapter even if you haven't finished the previous one. It's also really not difficult enough."", ""This mobile puzzle game is really fun to play. I'm a fan of the HITMAN games & this is another great one. 👍"", 'Just as pretty as Lara Croft GO, brilliant board game aesthetic, and legitimately challenging. Never can delete this one.', ""Yay: Excellent and gorgeous setup, making it look and feel like you're playing an actual board game. Really makes you think ahead to solve the puzzles. Great way to pass the time. Nay: Nothing much, except maybe that this will most likely not become a real board game you can touch, feel, and own. Final Say: A great, quirky addition to the Hitman series. Worth the price you pay for it, whether you're a fan of the series, or just puzzle games in general."", 'Pretty good - plenty of thinking to get through the levels - Lara Go is better, more recent - and better action and movement- I am now re-playing Lara - but this one is definitely interesting enough to play through', 'Possibly the best in the Go! series, Hitman is a brainy puzzle game in which you move your character like a chess piece, trying to traverse a level withoit being seen by enemies. The graphics are very impressive, with strong art & effects. Due to its nature, the game is perfect in short bursts. Most importantly, the Hitman concepts are very cleverly translated into the Go! design, making for a fun, consistent & intelligent game. Strongly recommended as one of the better games on a mobile phone!!', 'Great UI and puzzles. Was always a fan of Hitman and this just makes it better.', ""Lara Croft GO is way better. This game has no animations or story to accompany the puzzles, so you literally just move a Hitman piece around on a digital board game, level after level. The camera mostly stays overhead. The puzzles are fascinating, with snipers, teleportation, etc., though I have to say I enjoyed the aesthetic of Lara Croft GO a lot more and the relics you can find. The difficulty seems the same in both games. Anyway, this game isn't bad, but not as good as Lara Croft GO."", ""Ok. Is this checkers??? I was expecting to be like Lara Croft with some animation to it. I didn't like it. I'm out of this"", ""No in-app purchases that are basically necessary (you can buy hints but... it's a strategy game. So of course you can get by just don't without buying hints.), tons of levels and fantastic gameplay. I just wish they would add even more levels or release a sequel. Oh and two annoying UI things: There is no counter telling you which turn it is. Which makes extra goals with maximum turns annoying. Also, it's a pain to figure out which levels you haven't 100%ed yet."", 'Great game. Captures the essence of hitman perfectly.', ""Worth the money. It has almost nothing to do with the actual hitman game but this doesn't make this game bad. Levels are very challenging and really makes you think about how to complete the challenges. The only issue is that you can never complete all challenges in a perfect run, sometimes you can but for most levels there is a perfect run for each challenge individually."", ""I didn't know what to expect from this game, considering it's a mobile Hitman game, which is a series I'm unfamiliar with. But man, this is a well designed puzzle Hitman game. I only know the series from YouTube videos I've seen, but this seems to be faithful to the source material, given that you want a much simpler version of Hitman. For $0.99, this is a pretty great game. I would say it's worth your money. Once I finish it, it's likely I'll check out the other GO games from Square Enix."", ""It's unlike any other game with a beautiful interface and style. The set pieces are charming and the gameplay is challenging and fun. I'm really enjoying the experience"", ""Good game, but not as good as Lara Croft Go. It's worth picking up on sale."", ""Really good take on a mobile hitman game, perfect for picking up and leaving as all mobile games should be, perfect difficulty curve teaching you the basics and then dropping you in on a bit of a thinker. Great puzzle game even you if you're not into the hitman games, Highly recommend.. possibly do a lite version with less levels to give people a chance to see what it's like?""]"

Its just very short. For 5 quid on a mobile device, I'd want more from it. The design of the features are detailed and inspiring. But I'm just going to harp on about how small it is. In context, a fiver on a game is quite a considerable amount. And the game is only a couple hrs long. More content please. Having said that I'm going to buy the next one."", ""This game was great until you got to the room with the typewriter and safe. The touch sensitivity doesn't work the way it should. On my phone, when you touch the typewriter or safe, it sound uncontrollably and you can't get to the letters as they spin out of control. Googled troubleshooting and nothing worked. Also seems to be a known issue. Hoping it's resolved soon."", 'Has been very much fun and makes you think, I am looking forward to #3 and #4 ""Old Sins"". I hope more will come after that. Any game that makes you use you brain is a good game as far as I am concerned. But these go beyond that by making the game look and feel like you just find it hard to put down and take a break. That is one sign of a very well made game.', ""So far, I've played 3 of the series. Started with the newest. But go in order. Just better. Not really a spoiler playing newest 1st, but you figure out the null quicker. On to #3 of the series. It will be sad finishing the series.. WELL worth the tiny price to pay. Hours of fun for the price of a beer. Make a 5th!!!!!!"", ""After the third try get the game to function, I finally could enjoy it. Some of the puzzles are almost too simple, but some are challenging and even delightful! So I changed my 1-star rating (when there was no way I could play) to 4-star. It seems that there are problems with the download and if you encounter any problems, just uninstall and try again. Without this issue, and because of the simplicity of some puzzles, it's not a 5-star."", ""This game is wonderful! Graphics are beautiful, story is captivating. The controls are somewhat annoying because of how often you have to zoom in and then back out but it's a very minor annoyance. This game is worth the money, each volume (whole game)takes roughly 4-5 hours to fully complete while each chapter can take 1 to 2 hours depending how good you are. Hopefully the third instalment is just as good as the first 2!"", ""I never pay for apps but the room games will always be an exception. Soooo amazing and super satisfying. Accomplishments much more rewarding when completed with hints disabled. I'm a big fan off puzzle boxes and logic games so as well as entertainment this game provides me with inspiration, as I'm attempting to make one of my own. Way to gooooooo Fireproof games!"", ""I have ended up play the room 2 out of sequence but having said that it doesn't seem to matter. I thoroughly enjoyed this game and it made the old (65yr old) grey cells work hard. I am off to play the others now. Keep up the good work. I recommend this game to anyone who wants a challenge."", ""Awesome graphics! Game overall is very good! Nice brain teasers! If it wasn't for some hints it would have taken much longer! (It took me few days to finish it) very nice though, looking forward to play the next one! ;) Hope we will have many more to come :)"", ""Brilliant, my only gripe is it didn't go longer! This series of games are by far the Best mobile games I've ever played! Please keep them under $5 . I definitely wouldn't have tried them if the 1st one wasn't so cheap! Worth every cent! PLEASE make more of these games!!!"", ""Touch sensitivity is out of order. I have no problems placing/interacting with most objects on my Pixel 4XL but anything that requires precision (e.g. dials, typewriters, etc.) is absolutely appalling. When I touch those things they would spin like crazy. This was the same with the first game but didn't affect me much. I'm now doing the chapter with the typewriter and I can't complete it because there is no way for me to type the words that are required because I cannot select the letters..."", ""Excellent game! Makes you think hard in order to find solutions. Please develop more, I would indeed purchase them. Who ever thought these games up has a high intelligence. Edit I've just played this game a second time, the last time some months ago. Its surprising how much one forgets the solutions. Thoroughly enjoyed it again. Time to purchase Room 3. Again thank you, it been a while since I played something that uses ones brain as opposed to the boring match 3 games that simply numb the brain"", ""Great, if occasionally infuriating, game! Really expands on the concept of the original Room with greatly expanded puzzles. Unlike before, the puzzles aren't simply with one item, but multiples areas in a setting. The controls are a little frustrating sometimes, yet not enough to take too much away from the experience. All in all really enjoyed playing, and completing, this game over the past ~3 hours and am looking forward to the next one!"", ""Chapter 4 (poker room) is glitchy. The clues (used all 4 in hopes it would let me skip) only tell me what I already know. Need to enter passcode to open the safe. But the dial constantly spins and resets. No way to go beyond this point. Google won't give refund. Had similar issue with typewrite (as someone else mentioned) but not as bad (was still able to complete task). Tried uninstalling/reinstalling. Didn't help. Deleted. Now wary of the other games in this series."", ""A fantastic occult-y puzzle/escape room game. This installment does a good job of fleshing out the plot from the first game, and is a great set up for the third. It can be more intense than the first one (I don't usually like things that get scary, though it's more thriller than horror), and I like how it explores different settings while remaining cohesive. Really amazing, especially for a phone game."", 'Challenging and lengthy puzzles that are well thought and keep you guessing. The game is well polished and looks and sounds great. Some puzzles are simply lengthy because it can take a while to find the switch or lever, others I found highly rewarding for persevering and getting through.', ""Absolutely loved how beautiful this game is. Played on One Plus 6t. When I thought I found a bug in some instances, it was actually part of the puzzle, and when reading some of the 1 star reviews, it looks like they might have had the same. Game play is fluent. Story line was absolutely unclear, could not follow at all, but I don't really care about that. Loved it, will play all fireproof room games."", ""I played the first on PC just recently and learned these were available on mobile. This plays very well! There were times I wished I had a bigger screen, and the drawer in the last level was really finicky. I can't wait to play the other two!"", ""Great game, but as many others have said, the touch controls are all out of whack. I played fine up until the Tarot card room with the safe dial. Can't spin the dial to lock in the correct letters, making the puzzle impossible to complete."", 'Not sure yet what to think! Loved the first one but the second one, on the ship I can not seem to get back to the treasure chest where the hint tells me to go. This seems like a big issue to me ! May try to restart the level ( though I would rather not ) and go from there ! If not, I want a refund for part 2 and 3 because I also purchased part 3. Will update review if I can connect again to the game. The original part one was OUTSTANDING!! Bravo to Devs!! Well thought out and executed. So we sha', ""Honestly, this game is just FANTASTIC! It is EPIC, FASCINATING, confusing as HECK sometimes (both puzzles and storyline), super mysterious and convoluted, and not just a little creepy (but that's part of the fun!😆) However, if you have kids who are sensitive to that, you might want to wait until they're older to try and play it. Of course, the best option would probably be to have you or their parents or guardians try it out first and then gauge it to see if this is something they can handle."", ""I loved the game but some controls were hypersensitive, making some parts more difficult than necessary, but it was more of an annoyance than anything. It didnt detract from the fun of the game at all! It's too bad there isn't a free version. I would not mind watching ads for a game this good."", ""It makes you think use your brain you think is gonna go one way and then the whole situation changes on you that's what our real game suppose to do it keeps you in suspense like you're suspended in air with out the noose tied around your neck The game is wonderful top notch don't look at the measly 2 or $3 I guarantee you the money is well worth it"", 'I highly enjoyed my time playing this game. This is the first of the series I started with and I can\'t wait to dive into the rest. Every puzzle I solved almost on my own but the times I did need a hint always gave me an ""OH. RIGHT. THAT"" feeling. Shaved off a good 3-4 hours off my flight too so that\'s a plus', 'An Excellent game and well worth the price. Exceptional graphics, gameplay is just as challenging as it needs to be, No annoying ads to distract you from the game. Will definitely purchase/play the next installment.', ""Not over hyping when I say it was awesome, challenging, beautiful, scary, tense and absolutely worth the price. I had to catch my breath sometimes (especially at the end) because I got so into the setting. The 'hint' feature works great, not revealing too much at a time."", 'The Room games have spoiled me. Now it seems most games are juvenile or boreing. I have all four of the games and completed two of them. It doesnt get any better.These games have captured my imagination like no others. Hey Creators more we want more...', 'Wow.. the puzzles are creative and challenging but not too difficult to the point of irritation. The graphics and cinematics are on point, and the storyline is quite interesting. Well done folks, TR 1 and TR 2 are the only games I have ever paid for and I think I have to get TR 3 now', 'Game is designed well an enjoyable, except for some game breaking bugs. Scrolling the typewriter is basically hypersensitive and getting to individual letters deliberately was horrible, but I got through it everytime. The hidden safe later is impossible and impassible. Hoping for a bug fix in the future, but without it, I bought a broken game.', ""I love everything about this game except their buggy controls. It was manageable in the beginning until the infamous taro card room when you try to turn the dial. Why isn't there a fix for this when everyone is experiencing this?!"", 'Really brilliant game. Beautiful, sumptuous graphics and a creepy atmospheres combine with puzzle solving that REALLY makes use of touch screen controls. It\'s short, yes, but think of the whole ""The Room"" series as a single game divided into chapters to make each of them mobile game priced. And there\'s no currency, boo microtransactions, no DLC - just a beautiful, Myst style puzzle game of clockwork boxes and intricate models', ""Absolutely one of thr best games I've played! The music was intense, the graphics were realistic and the puzzles were brilliant! I did not want the game to end. I've purchased The Room One. Two and Three. I look forward to many more. I had zero technical difficulties. Amazing game! Thank you!"", ""One of the best puzzle games I have found. The cost of the game is well worth the value. I much rather buy editions of The Room than all the in ap purchase other games make you use. It's like being in a multiple layered escape room with just a little creepy factor. Not sure there is really a plot, just good puzzles, but possibly the cryptic notes will make sense when I progress."", ""This is a really good game series. I normally don't buy games on the market but I am more then willing to drop the 1 or 2 dollars per game. This are fun and each one is better than the last. I'm going to go buy number 3 now."", ""Only criticism is the boat level was a joke and shouldn't even be considered a level. Also, wish the game was a little longer. Completed it in 4 hours which isn't that long considering it's pay 2 play."", 'Absolutely love these games bought the first one and played it then bought all 3 remaining at once so I could play them uninterrupted. My 14 year old loves them just as much as I do, and anything that me at 40 and her at 14 can both enjoy is amazing.', ""Freaking addictive! Worth the money.. all of their games. So well done. You can tell how much work went into these games. 50 out of 5 stars, you guys. Don't stop making these....because I need answers. 😂 I'm about to bring in the new year playing the third game lol ❤️"", 'Great game but often somethings are hidden and the controls dont allow you to see that view unless you are very precise about where you click making it sometimes hard to proceed in the game. Over all I enjoyed the game it wasnt to fast to get to the end but I did make it to the end without frusteration.', 'Very much had the feel of Myst. Enjoyed playing this though had to use the hints a lot because the hiding places for items can be very tricky. Glad there are games for us who like to slowly explore without tests of speed and dexterity.', ""These games are great, and have fantastic puzzles to solve. I've played one and two now and looking forward to getting three. There are sections that might be a little scary for some but not awful and not horror.""]"

The gameplay is fun and innovative, the music and sound design are lovely, and the characters are adorable to look at. This whole game breathes style, and it's great to see that some creators still have artistic vision these days. It's short, but not woefully so, and the ending was satisfying and poignant.

Looking forward to some more levels in the future!"", ""What an AMAZING time I had playing this game. The music, the graphics, the visuals, the puzzles, the game play, all of it was a combination of entertaining and brain workout that kept me glued to the screen for hours. I paid for the ad-free privilege, but also to thank the developers and contributors for their work. I hope they create more of these games!!! I'd even buy them for consoles!!"", ""I love this game, both the first and second. I played it years ago back when it was free and stupidly uninstalled it. Yes it's pricey for a shorter game (maybe 1 day if you were really committed), but I can't get enough of it! The graphics are incredible to say the least.

I do wish it was longer so that it would never end!"", ""Amazing game, but after the 10th chapter, you have two circles turned yellow. You go in the final door and complete the challenge, but when you are done the final circle doesn't light up and your stuck. Am I just being dumb because I still see one more open door? Have been stuck for ages. Great game nevertheless"", ""This game was beautiful. The puzzles aren't exceptionally challenging, the longest took maybe 20 minutes, but they're just challenging enough to not get bored.

The puzzles are creative, the graphics are beautiful, the music is soothing, and the characters are adorable Overall this is probably my favorite game on the appstore ☺️"", 'Gameplay and visuals are good, my only gripe is that the game is too short and the levels are pretty easy.

If they had hidden the path by having alternate routes and dead ends it would have made the game a bit more challenging.', ""I think this game is really interesting and if you like the trippiness of this game you would definitely like the game fez. My problem with the game is that there isn't much content. The story is super short for the asking price. Just too expensive for the length. But works well!"", 'This game is so sick do to the puzzles and the way it twists your mind is shocking and this is a rare puzzle game that has a story to it and the fact that they fully mastered the arts of tales and puzzles makes this the first of many puzzle games to deserve the five stars or at least enough to try it', ""It's a great game with optical illusions where you think outside the box. The only reason it's not 5 stars is because there's not a lot of replayability.

It refused to start when first installed, but restarting the phone fixed it.', ""I LOVE this game. I've been playing Tomb Raider since I could hold a controller, and this is super reminiscent of those games (while obviously not being the same gameplay). The puzzles get super challenging, and the game continuously integrates new puzzle mechanics as you progress, keeping it fresh (but not confusing)."", ""I've also played hitman go but I think this is better. It's the perfect game to play for a few minutes, but it can also capture you for longer. I picked it up for a quid and think it's great for that, much better than having to put up with ads or in app purchases."", ""It's the best and only game i think in adve-puzle genre. Varied levels of mind bogglness. Only thing is that i think game is unfinished, due to the whole story line in the background of the game misses a few levels.

The only things i'm not a fan of are a couple of the animations and the fact that Lara doesn't smoothly rotate when moving. this isn't anything major, though, so i can't complain much. As a fan of the francise i would've liked more graphical violence, but this is a mobile game, so i understand the decision to not do that. Anyhow, i highly recommend this to just about anyone.

You can't play as many types of games as on a computer or a console mostly because of the input limitations. Just like you can't play an fps on a mobile phone. This point is one of the thing that makes it earn 5 star because it is playable everywhere, without special requiring too much finger dexterity. The second is the quality of the story telling. It's simple yet effective and really good looking. Same for graphics and sound. Just like a real PC game."", ""I'm a logic puzzle fan, so this is my FAVORITE type of game, discovered Tomb Raider when my husband found an old PS1 back in '03.

Its just very short. For 5 quid on a mobile device, I'd want more from it. The design of the features are detailed and inspiring. But I'm just going to harp on about how small it is. In context, a fiver on a game is quite a considerable amount. And the game is only a couple hrs long. More content please. Having said that I'm going to buy the next one."", ""This game was great until you got to the room with the typewriter and safe. The touch sensitivity doesn't work the way it should. On my phone, when you touch the typewriter or safe, it sound uncontrollably and you can't get to the letters as they spin out of control. Googled troubleshooting and nothing worked. Also seems to be a known issue. Hoping it's resolved soon."", 'Has been very much fun and makes you think, I am looking forward to #3 and #4 ""Old Sins"". I hope more will come after that. Any game that makes you use you brain is a good game as far as I am concerned. But these go beyond that by making the game look and feel like you just find it hard to put down and take a break. That is one sign of a very well made game.', ""So far, I've played 3 of the series. Started with the newest. But go in order. Just better. Not really a spoiler playing newest 1st, but you figure out the null quicker. On to #3 of the series. It will be sad finishing the series.. WELL worth the tiny price to pay. Hours of fun for the price of a beer. Make a 5th!!!!!!"", ""After the third try get the game to function, I finally could enjoy it. Some of the puzzles are almost too simple, but some are challenging and even delightful! So I changed my 1-star rating (when there was no way I could play) to 4-star. It seems that there are problems with the download and if you encounter any problems, just uninstall and try again. Without this issue, and because of the simplicity of some puzzles, it's not a 5-star."", ""This game is wonderful! Graphics are beautiful, story is captivating. The controls are somewhat annoying because of how often you have to zoom in and then back out but it's a very minor annoyance. This game is worth the money, each volume (whole game)takes roughly 4-5 hours to fully complete while each chapter can take 1 to 2 hours depending how good you are. Hopefully the third instalment is just as good as the first 2!"", ""I never pay for apps but the room games will always be an exception. Soooo amazing and super satisfying. Accomplishments much more rewarding when completed with hints disabled. I'm a big fan off puzzle boxes and logic games so as well as entertainment this game provides me with inspiration, as I'm attempting to make one of my own. Way to gooooooo Fireproof games!"", ""I have ended up play the room 2 out of sequence but having said that it doesn't seem to matter. I thoroughly enjoyed this game and it made the old (65yr old) grey cells work hard. I am off to play the others now. Keep up the good work. I recommend this game to anyone who wants a challenge."", ""Awesome graphics! Game overall is very good! Nice brain teasers! If it wasn't for some hints it would have taken much longer! (It took me few days to finish it) very nice though, looking forward to play the next one! ;) Hope we will have many more to come :)"", ""Brilliant, my only gripe is it didn't go longer! This series of games are by far the Best mobile games I've ever played! Please keep them under $5 . I definitely wouldn't have tried them if the 1st one wasn't so cheap! Worth every cent! PLEASE make more of these games!!!"", ""Touch sensitivity is out of order. I have no problems placing/interacting with most objects on my Pixel 4XL but anything that requires precision (e.g. dials, typewriters, etc.) is absolutely appalling. When I touch those things they would spin like crazy. This was the same with the first game but didn't affect me much. I'm now doing the chapter with the typewriter and I can't complete it because there is no way for me to type the words that are required because I cannot select the letters..."", ""Excellent game! Makes you think hard in order to find solutions. Please develop more, I would indeed purchase them. Who ever thought these games up has a high intelligence. Edit I've just played this game a second time, the last time some months ago. Its surprising how much one forgets the solutions. Thoroughly enjoyed it again. Time to purchase Room 3. Again thank you, it been a while since I played something that uses ones brain as opposed to the boring match 3 games that simply numb the brain"", ""Great, if occasionally infuriating, game! Really expands on the concept of the original Room with greatly expanded puzzles. Unlike before, the puzzles aren't simply with one item, but multiples areas in a setting. The controls are a little frustrating sometimes, yet not enough to take too much away from the experience. All in all really enjoyed playing, and completing, this game over the past ~3 hours and am looking forward to the next one!"", ""Chapter 4 (poker room) is glitchy. The clues (used all 4 in hopes it would let me skip) only tell me what I already know. Need to enter passcode to open the safe. But the dial constantly spins and resets. No way to go beyond this point. Google won't give refund. Had similar issue with typewrite (as someone else mentioned) but not as bad (was still able to complete task). Tried uninstalling/reinstalling. Didn't help. Deleted. Now wary of the other games in this series."", ""A fantastic occult-y puzzle/escape room game. This installment does a good job of fleshing out the plot from the first game, and is a great set up for the third. It can be more intense than the first one (I don't usually like things that get scary, though it's more thriller than horror), and I like how it explores different settings while remaining cohesive. Really amazing, especially for a phone game."", 'Challenging and lengthy puzzles that are well thought and keep you guessing. The game is well polished and looks and sounds great. Some puzzles are simply lengthy because it can take a while to find the switch or lever, others I found highly rewarding for persevering and getting through.', ""Absolutely loved how beautiful this game is. Played on One Plus 6t. When I thought I found a bug in some instances, it was actually part of the puzzle, and when reading some of the 1 star reviews, it looks like they might have had the same. Game play is fluent. Story line was absolutely unclear, could not follow at all, but I don't really care about that. Loved it, will play all fireproof room games."", ""Great game, but as many others have said, the touch controls are all out of whack. I played fine up until the Tarot card room with the safe dial. Can't spin the dial to lock in the correct letters, making the puzzle impossible to complete."", ""I played the first on PC just recently and learned these were available on mobile. This plays very well! There were times I wished I had a bigger screen, and the drawer in the last level was really finicky. I can't wait to play the other two!"", 'Not sure yet what to think! Loved the first one but the second one, on the ship I can not seem to get back to the treasure chest where the hint tells me to go. This seems like a big issue to me ! May try to restart the level ( though I would rather not ) and go from there ! If not, I want a refund for part 2 and 3 because I also purchased part 3. Will update review if I can connect again to the game. The original part one was OUTSTANDING!! Bravo to Devs!! Well thought out and executed. So we sha', ""Honestly, this game is just FANTASTIC! It is EPIC, FASCINATING, confusing as HECK sometimes (both puzzles and storyline), super mysterious and convoluted, and not just a little creepy (but that's part of the fun!😆) However, if you have kids who are sensitive to that, you might want to wait until they're older to try and play it. Of course, the best option would probably be to have you or their parents or guardians try it out first and then gauge it to see if this is something they can handle."", ""It makes you think use your brain you think is gonna go one way and then the whole situation changes on you that's what our real game suppose to do it keeps you in suspense like you're suspended in air with out the noose tied around your neck The game is wonderful top notch don't look at the measly 2 or $3 I guarantee you the money is well worth it"", ""I loved the game but some controls were hypersensitive, making some parts more difficult than necessary, but it was more of an annoyance than anything. It didnt detract from the fun of the game at all! It's too bad there isn't a free version. I would not mind watching ads for a game this good."", 'I highly enjoyed my time playing this game. This is the first of the series I started with and I can\'t wait to dive into the rest. Every puzzle I solved almost on my own but the times I did need a hint always gave me an ""OH. RIGHT. THAT"" feeling. Shaved off a good 3-4 hours off my flight too so that\'s a plus', 'An Excellent game and well worth the price. Exceptional graphics, gameplay is just as challenging as it needs to be, No annoying ads to distract you from the game. Will definitely purchase/play the next installment.', ""Not over hyping when I say it was awesome, challenging, beautiful, scary, tense and absolutely worth the price. I had to catch my breath sometimes (especially at the end) because I got so into the setting. The 'hint' feature works great, not revealing too much at a time."", 'The Room games have spoiled me. Now it seems most games are juvenile or boreing. I have all four of the games and completed two of them. It doesnt get any better.These games have captured my imagination like no others. Hey Creators more we want more...', 'Wow.. the puzzles are creative and challenging but not too difficult to the point of irritation. The graphics and cinematics are on point, and the storyline is quite interesting. Well done folks, TR 1 and TR 2 are the only games I have ever paid for and I think I have to get TR 3 now', 'Game is designed well an enjoyable, except for some game breaking bugs. Scrolling the typewriter is basically hypersensitive and getting to individual letters deliberately was horrible, but I got through it everytime. The hidden safe later is impossible and impassible. Hoping for a bug fix in the future, but without it, I bought a broken game.', ""I love everything about this game except their buggy controls. It was manageable in the beginning until the infamous taro card room when you try to turn the dial. Why isn't there a fix for this when everyone is experiencing this?!"", 'Really brilliant game. Beautiful, sumptuous graphics and a creepy atmospheres combine with puzzle solving that REALLY makes use of touch screen controls. It\'s short, yes, but think of the whole ""The Room"" series as a single game divided into chapters to make each of them mobile game priced. And there\'s no currency, boo microtransactions, no DLC - just a beautiful, Myst style puzzle game of clockwork boxes and intricate models', ""One of the best puzzle games I have found. The cost of the game is well worth the value. I much rather buy editions of The Room than all the in ap purchase other games make you use. It's like being in a multiple layered escape room with just a little creepy factor. Not sure there is really a plot, just good puzzles, but possibly the cryptic notes will make sense when I progress."", ""Absolutely one of thr best games I've played! The music was intense, the graphics were realistic and the puzzles were brilliant! I did not want the game to end. I've purchased The Room One. Two and Three. I look forward to many more. I had zero technical difficulties. Amazing game! Thank you!"", ""Only criticism is the boat level was a joke and shouldn't even be considered a level. Also, wish the game was a little longer. Completed it in 4 hours which isn't that long considering it's pay 2 play."", 'Absolutely love these games bought the first one and played it then bought all 3 remaining at once so I could play them uninterrupted. My 14 year old loves them just as much as I do, and anything that me at 40 and her at 14 can both enjoy is amazing.', ""This is a really good game series. I normally don't buy games on the market but I am more then willing to drop the 1 or 2 dollars per game. This are fun and each one is better than the last. I'm going to go buy number 3 now."", ""Freaking addictive! Worth the money.. all of their games. So well done. You can tell how much work went into these games. 50 out of 5 stars, you guys. Don't stop making these....because I need answers. 😂 I'm about to bring in the new year playing the third game lol ❤️"", 'Great game but often somethings are hidden and the controls dont allow you to see that view unless you are very precise about where you click making it sometimes hard to proceed in the game. Over all I enjoyed the game it wasnt to fast to get to the end but I did make it to the end without frusteration.', 'Very much had the feel of Myst. Enjoyed playing this though had to use the hints a lot because the hiding places for items can be very tricky. Glad there are games for us who like to slowly explore without tests of speed and dexterity.', ""These games are great, and have fantastic puzzles to solve. I've played one and two now and looking forward to getting three. There are sections that might be a little scary for some but not awful and not horror.""]"

Graphics are a lot better than most mobile games, the plot is interesting and compelling, and the puzzles are a perfect level of challenging. The controls can be a little fiddly, but I think this is the kind of game your play if you like fiddling.

Keep up this wonderful work on', 'Hello people 👋🏻 I\'m really enjoying ""The Room: Epilogue."" I saved up Google Rewards to buy this game & I see myself purchasing more from Fireproof based on this experience. I\'m only moderately skilled in puzzling & found the game intriguing and challenging. The clue system is clever and rewards patience, frequently resulting in a gentle face palm for me. Some of the controls were not intuitive, so a minor knock there. Overall, this is a beautiful and well-executed puzzle game. Nicely done!', '""The Room"" is absolutely one of the best puzzle games ever. Albeit it has it\'s own weak spots. Amongst them is having excessive chest puzzles and less various riddles; unlike the Room two that has more liberal environment and variegated mystries. Likewise having a few levels is another problem which should be paid attention if there are going to be more spectacular puzzle games from Fireproof. Wish you a great future👍', 'The game has stunning graphics. Effort was visible throughout the game and leaves the users a good impression. It has the most challenging and creative puzzles I have seen yet. There are no bugs encountered although one major problem in the game is that the brightness keeps adjusting to low which is not suitable especially if I were to play outdoors. I would definitely buy the sequel for this. Must download for its worthy price.', ""I love this game and the three that follow after. These are the only games I have ever spent money on and would all over again. I wish I could have my memory of the game wiped just to play it over again. I still do anyways, it's so much fun and there is so much, it's easy to forget it all and redo it again with almost as much of a challenge as the first time. Hints are free, but the game makes enough sense to not need them frequently. I HIGHLY recommend this game!"", ""Such a great game. The puzzle boxes and the atmosphere are mysterious enough to keep you going. I passed on this game for years. Didn't realize I was missing out. I commend the developers. Great job!"", 'A-mazing Game literally! This game is very well made, the graphics are awesome. There is a great amount of time and detail put into this series. It is challenging and addicting. Absolutely worth the money, no adds. Just great mind boggling puzzles and a good story line .', ""This was a lot of fun!!! I only wish there were more chapters so I could keep going. This would be totally baller if it's available for VR! (I've chills just thinking about it XD )"", ""This was such an unexpected delight! I'd been searching for a good puzzle/escape game and this one delivered! I didn't know much going in and was pleasantly surprised by the occult theme! The puzzles are challenging but not infuriating, the story is creative, and the visuals are stunning!"", 'Caved and bought the game. One of THE BEST games I\'ve ever played on my phone. Controls work perfectly, challenging puzzles, and you can choose to use the hints or not. Def worth it!! Played every version of ""The Room"" games and they are all top-notch!! All are 5 star games!', ""The game is great when it works, but I don't understand why it's so hard to double tap something to zoom in certain spots. Some elements have time limits and I find myself fighting just to zoom in to perform an action. And it's not now and then, it's constantly fighting just to press the correct thing over and over. I really want to like it but it's completely unplayable."", ""This game is really great! Totally worth $1 if you like puzzles and escape type games. Superb graphics. Super smooth gameplay. Somewhat short, but it's high quality. Definitely gonna go buy all the other Room games by these folks. Nicely done."", 'So far I have only completed 2 puzzles but I am hooked. Best 99 cents I have ever spent. There is a guy on YouTube who finds complex puzzles and figures out how to open them. This game is like that but virtual and I love it. The ambiance created by the music is superb!', 'Thank god this game has consistently progress saving! Spet over an hour on this game disregarding the fact my phone was dying xD But loaded it back up and right were I left off. Thank goodness. It is a fairly addictive game and worth the $1. Kept me preoccupied so far😁 Looking forward to buy their new series. Might be complicated for some but they give you plenty of clues when you are completely lost.', ""Brilliant game if you puzzle solving and mystery. The music is beautiful and the gameplay is smooth and relaxing. Sound effects and 3d graphics make you feel like you're actually solving a real puzzle box. All the sequels are well worth the money."", 'This game is so awesome, really was wanting to start puzzling and was inspired by Chris Ramsey so when he showed this game I was pumped to try it out. 10 out of 10. The clues are in thought provoking not just the solution!', 'Beautifully made and very well built. The puzzles are a perfect difficulty to challenge but not make you rage quit. When you solve a puzzle it feels so rewarding! Will be buying the rest of this series.']"
