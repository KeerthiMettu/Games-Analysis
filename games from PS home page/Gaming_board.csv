Dominoes,com.LoopGames.Domino,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.LoopGames.Domino&hl=en&gl=us,"Dominoes is definitely one of the most famous board game in the world. There are dozens of rules out there, but three modes are getting most of the attention:

- Draw dominoes: simple, relaxing, play your tiles on either side of the board. You only need to match the tile you have with one of the 2 ends already on the board.

- Block dominoes: basically the same as Draw Dominoes. The main difference is you have to pass your turn if you run out of options (whereas you can pick an extra domino from the boneyard in the previous mode).

- Dominoes All Five: slightly more complex. Each turn, you need to add all ends of the board, and count the number of pips on them. If it is a multiple of five, you score those points. A bit difficult at first but you will quickly get it!

Chess,com.jetstartgames.chess,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jetstartgames.chess&hl=en&gl=us,"Hi Players,

As you know, Chess is one of the oldest strategy games in the world.
Chess is an excellent board logic game that develops such skills as tactics, strategy and visual memory.
I'm trying to create an application that allows a player of any level to enjoy the game.

Play Chess, unlock levels and be Chess Master!

Chess pieces:

- The pawn moves to one field forward or two fields at the first move of this figure; beats diagonally to one field forward.
- The king moves to one field in the vertical, horizontal or diagonal.
- The queen moves to any distance vertically, horizontally or diagonally.
- The rook moves to any distance vertically or horizontally.
- The knight moves to the field two fields along the vertical and one horizontally or one field vertically and two horizontally.
- The bishop moves to any distance diagonally.

Important Chess situations:

- Check - the situation in chess when a king is under immediate attack by opponent's pieces
- Checkmate - the situation in chess when the player whose turn it is to move is in check and has no legal move to escape check.
- Stalemate - the situation in chess when the player whose turn it is to move has no legal move and is not in check. (draw)

The goal of the game is to checkmate the other king.

Two special moves in Chess:

- Castling is a double move, performed by the king and the rook that never moved.
- En passant is a move in which a pawn can take an opponent's pawn if it jumps over a field under the pawn's blow.

Features:

- Ten levels of difficulty
- Game Assistant (Helper)
- Ability to undo a move
- Stars for levels completed without the undo button
- Seven different themes
- Two board views (Vertical - 2D and Horizontal - 3D)
- Alternate mode
- Two player mode
- Realistic graphics
- Save function
- Sound effects
- Small size

If you want to play good Chess, you can help me make the app better.
Please write your feedback and suggestions here; I will read them and improve the quality of the application!

I also like the puzzle which is the ""Mate in One Move"". Really makes you think and use your brain. The hints are cool too. Shows you a move in a game or the puzzle. So yeah this game is amazing!❤️ 5🌟s', 'Its chess it can get very challenging in the upper levels. Although I have one concern in the beginning stage you might wanna put an optional tutorial should anyone be new to the game start playing. In and getting into harder subjects address: promotions, castling, enpasant, and maybe some tactics like forks and skewers. Other then that always fun to play and increase in experience. Btw the puzzles are an awesome addition! Maybe some multiple move mates.', ""It's a good game but sometimes you wanna do a move and it doesn't let you. I don't know if it's just my tablet doing this. And sometimes when you do a certain amount of moves, it says it's a draw. The game developers should put a setting that you can have unlimited amount of moves. Otherwise I like it that you can do multiplayer."", 'Great job! It is a very challenging game. First the levels up to candidate master are easy but from master it is very tough.

Easy level is too easy, and the intermediate is almost more than intermediate."", 'This is unfair. The candidate master is truly idea bot. It know where to move and literally can read the future game way. The only way we past the other is because the bot accidently wrong move the queen and we can eat it. But candidate master is impossible. Also why when I move the queen into the enemy king it should be Chad match but the enemy king eat my queen. Even when the enemy queen move it queen to my king and it count as chad match. This totally wrong.', 'Easy to use but it seems like I always have to play as white.

Power up system is about profit and poor sportsmanship. 2. Minimum bets make for losing too many coins too quickly, or encourage greed with large bets. 3.

Coin and Cash packs not economical.', ""Reduced my 3 stars to 1 This game would be more fun if.. 1) The dice didn't have patterns of what numbers end up being rolled 2) You get rid of the pathetic powerups OR create online zero powerup rooms.

I found that if you don't pick that option, your dice is set to fail almost always. So if you don't pay, you will definitely lose.

Its not fun anymore cuz comp doesnt know the logics of the game. And the worst part is getting killed or eaten by one..lol otherwise its 5stars.. so 2 for now', 'This game is extremely biased. The leading contestant gets 6 whereas the loser never gets 6, this is mainly so that then can buy coins and win', ""it a bit predictable, you can tell when you are going to get send home or send home someone, and its unbelivable where you roll and the person rolls same thing as you to send you home.

The rewards are not enough to actually play effectively since the helps cost far more than the rewards. Score and stars seem to be based on speed which isn't how mahjong should be played.

I'd give it 3 1/2 stars for adults and 5 stars for youngsters"", ""I feel like this game just makes you buy stuff if you want to be successful at it.

There is a lot to like about this game, the format is really cute and it is relaxing. Unfortunately, the flat out unsolvable levels that eat up coins are very frustrating. I'm not talking about difficult levels--I'm talking about levels that you can only do one move or less before you are forced to reshuffle or use a bonus.

It just sets at the loading page with music going and does nothing.', 'Very fastmoving mahjong game. Wonderful. Hope to see different patterns.', ""Jam City games are usually very well made games, but I'm not a fan of this one. Mahjong City Tours is less well balanced than Cookie Jam, for e.g. Levels not designated as harder levels are often the most difficult and only because of the random generation of tiles, not because of obstacles built into the level. Having to replay levels to progress is also frustrating, as the reason to replay them is not failing the level, but the random generation of souvenirs."", ""This may use Mahjong tiles, but it isn't Mahjong. Mahjong is a complex multiplayer game where you try to collect different sets of tiles. This is just a matching game: select two free tiles with the same shape on them (free once right and/or left side is not touching another tile). Matching would be more fun if the tiles had recognizable shapes instead of characters in a language I don't speak (and which aren't part of this not-Mahjong game). Pay to shuffle when no moves available also sucks."", 'Do not like the fact you have to have coins to shuffle. Shuffling should be free. But whatever. Gets 1 star from me.

BETTER MAHJONG games. Get to level 60 only to have to go BACK AND REPEAT the same levels, 41 thru 59 SEARCHING and hoping to earn, but rarely, missing tickets??????? Even on supposed easy levels above 60 are HARD that playing one board uses ALL your lives 3 times, making it 15 attempts to pass each board after level 70.', ""Love this game. Dont let the cartoon graphics fool you -this was very challenging. I loved the graphics, the fact that it does an auto zoom when you get closer to the end of the game, and the extra challenges and tournaments. It was really fun. Was just going to give this a trial run but I'm keeping it now."", 'Forced adds for over 30 seconds, finish a level, do you want to watch a video for extra rewards? You say no and click next, it then takes you to one anyway, if your lucky you can close after 5 seconds, if not, your stuck until it finishes, this got to the point that i hate this game, first review i am leaving about a game but this one was way to much', ""Sweet lil game! Its relaxing & it helps to keep the mind sharp. It really helps with my memory & trust me at age 55 I need all the help I can get! This app is extremely user friendly & loads of fun! Oh & they even reward you after you complete the easy & useful tasks they offer! I usually don't brag to much about an app but this one deserves some bragging because it truly is an awesome & fun app! Thanks to the makers of Mahjong City Tours! Y'all rock! 😘"", ""I was enjoying the game, and spent loads of coins on my way to unlocking the Christmas tile set, which told me yesterday I had 8 days left to unlock it.

Definitely keeping this for a long time! The levels get hard, but not so hard that they're unplayable. You get very satisfied once you finish the level and the power-ups help a ton! Would recommend this to everyone! Stay strong! 🀄"", 'One of the most boring games I have ever played. You just tap the screen to join tiles.

I am going to record some of these so called ""fair"" games and prove to all how bad this program is rigged.

NOPE! All the same computer advantages are still in place, excessively lucky rolls, coincidental needed numbers and the likes. The game is rigged, the developer still lies through his teeth, and more paid ""players"" are here to praise the program even though it is obvious the program is rigged. Don\'t believe any of the rhetoric here. This program is rigged, and the proof he claims to justify its legitimacy is a crock too. Save your money and avoid this like the plague!!!!!!!', 'Probably one of the better games out there but as one commenter said if you actually roll real dice you may find slightly more success against the computer on expert mode. While a computer does not ""cheat"" there are certain situations with the doubling cube where knowing the rolls ahead of time can give you a huge advantage. That being said there should be more board customization options available.', 'As my uncle once said, ""Never let truth get in the way of a good story"", so with this app ""Never let probability get in the way of an absolutely amazing double!"" LOL (on the computer side of course).  Seriously, I have looked into the proofs and can\'t fault them - so if it is cheating, it probably deserves more credit than the gameplay itself!  I would like to see an optional \'nudge\' button so the player can move forward in the roll numbers - by a configurable amount each time? It clearly DOES eg have far more success bringing men back in than the player does - is that not a cause for concern? - this is nothing to do with the ""superior game strategy""to which you ascribe the app\'s success, it is due to pure luck! Jon', ""Must have and worth your money if you are learning the game. Love picking up new skills and have already talked my wife into getting it too (she's an iPhone user). You won't be disappointed."", 'When a game app consistently gets the perfect roll, always the key number to defend or attack with, it quickly becomes unenjoyable to play... I love backgammon - just not against a flawed computer program.', 'Do not buy! First off, its too expensive for what it delivers. Plus the roll algorithm is incredibly leaning towards the computer. I would say to the affect that this game is not playable.']"

It has only two problems but they are serious. First, the quarantine specialist is broken and does not follow the boardgame rules. Second, you are far more likely to have outbreaks than in the boardgame. Updated: yup. The city you get three cubes in during an epidemic is then chosen during the follow on infection phase far more often than should be possible. Its a sad, obvious cheat. Update: Resilient Population often co-occurs with Epidemic.', 'This game is really well done and true to all the board game rules. I didn\'t notice any of the ""bugs"" some others had reported. I believe several of the bug reports are actually just people misunderstanding the board game rules in some areas. Outbreaks will naturally occur often if treatments aren\'t controlled really well. The discards of the recently infected cities go back on top of deck each time an epidemic card is drawn (which is also how the original board game was designed).', ""Excellent game; love the layout, the sound effects, the outbreak graphics.

So cheap and I can't wait to get 'on the brink' and 'in the lab'"", ""The game play is fun and I really like the game, but I feel like something is wrong with the randomness coding. I'm an intelligent person who plays games like this all the time, both digital and board. I've played at least 50+ times on the easiest level and I've only won one time. I feel like the odds on that are stacked against me. It makes it not fun when you just can't win."", ""Great app, plays just like the boardgame. I purchased the 'virulent strain' (which has plummeted our success rate 😉) and 'on the brink' add-ons. There's a bug which adds another player (Kelly) with a random job whenever 'on the brink'' is turned on, and you should be able to disable 'info' mid-game.. aside from those issues, great job!"", ""I've played this game on a GalaxyS8 for over a year and had one or two minor glitches. Notable one being when closing a game, rebooting and returning to it once in a while will not allow you to undo previous saved action. Aside from that it's been great and is true to the board game. It's nice to play the app to get good practice. It's possible to beat the game even on Legendary with Virulent Strain. My only wish is for Asmodee to continue adding all the expansions. I'd buy them in a heart beat."", ""I love the boardgame, but this was a huge disappointment. The algorithm is completely messed up so it is frustratingly impossible to beat. Just hoping an update will be made that fixed it, because I refuse to play until it's actually possible to win. The original game is difficult but possible to win. This version is not."", 'Seems to be an accurate representation of the board game. I bought this thinking that it would teach me how to play it, but in single player mode, one needs to play two roles. This makes for confusing gameplay; that and the fact that you are likely to loose (even with experienced players I am told), so it is difficult to learn from your mistakes.', ""I don't know why people say it's hard to win. Played my first game and won. It got down to the wire. Had 9 cards left in the deck and like 4 outbreaks. But it was fun. If you know the board game and can play well then you should have no problem. Again, maybe RNG-eezus was on my side, but I found the have really fun and enjoyable. It was a 2 player game. Researcher and engineer specialist I think? Would love for this to be an online multiplayer game."", ""I love this game. It reminds me of Elder signs. Not so much in the gameplay, but in the fact that it is a very very hard game to beat.

I play the board game a little more than i use the app, currently playing through Pandemic: Legacy every monday with a few friends (highly recommend it if you havent played it, a neat weekly twist on the original game). If I had one request of this game, it would be to allow casting to a Chromecast enabled device to be able to see the entire map while playing, kind of like what the app version of RISK does. Otherwise, this is a solid digital board game!', ""So addictive I bought the boardgame too! Intuitive UI, and uncluttered considering all the game's variables. You play 4-5 roles at a time.

I've had so much fun playing the boardgame with friends, and would love to be able to play remotely."", ""It's a good game. But there are a couple of bugs. First, the ability to see all the players cards disappears at times. To continue the game you have to close the game completely and relaunch. Secondly, in one of the extensions, the special orders card seems to have no effect on either the player whose turn it is or on the player chosen when the card is played. Sort out the bugs and it's *****"", ""This review is just a warning to others. This app has multiple bugs that have been reported numerous times but the app itself hasn't been updated since 2016. So you are buying an abandoned app that will never see another update or bug fix. Whoever operates the developer's Google account occasionally responds to reviews but they never fix anything. Buyer beware!"", 'App is REALLY well done. It reflects the board game well and the graphics are smooth as butter. You\'re able to control every aspect of the game that you control at home (ex: Number of players. Which characters you get or if you want random.) The ONLY thing I\'m ""meh"" about is with the max of 7 cards, at home if you transfer an 8th card we play where you can cure a disease if that drops you back to <7, but this app makes you get rid of a diff card and THEN cure which I feel like is a lil unfair.', ""Bugs, resilient population doesn't work, every time I use it, the card I remove from the game ends up at the top of the reshuffled deck.

Only problem is ""random"" role assignment 90% off the time is the same as the previous game', ""Can't play with computer AI. Either play with friends or by yourself playing all characters! Not what I expected! Wish I knew I could have gotten a refund!"", 'A great representation of the board game. Clear User Interface and easy to use.', 'Game has mistakes: Epidemic in one city can be followed by infection in the same city. In the board version of the game that card would be on discard pile!

You might win 1 out of every 100 games. Game needs work. Wouldnt waste your money on it.', ""Truly terrible draw algorithms. Nearly impossible to swap cards to cure diseases. Not to mention the number of epidemics that occur and then get intensified makes the game impossible to win. It certainly doesn't play well.

Requested refund on app. Disappointed it would not work. One of my favorite board games.', 'Random card are not random but they rather punish you. Whenever there is an epidemic the top card is most likely to be the city where it occurred so it makes it impossible to beat the game.

Pandemic Legacy would be a great addition.', ""I've been wanting this game for a while now so yesterday I decided to buy it! It honestly took me a while to get through the tutorial and it took a while to understand the whole thing, but now since I gotten the hang of it, it's an awesome game! Keep up the great work!"", 'Love pandemic. Love the extra modes. Love the challenges for Google play games.', 'Plays very much like the board game, and is just as hard. I is amazing that they could cram all the different things that you have to track, and have it easy to understand.', 'Good (paid) game scarred by IAPs. Pay to play, pay to win.

However I can't give it a full five stars because of two issues that combine to make online play almost impossible. One, tabbing out of the app to switch to any other screen (text messaging client for instance) will disconnect the player from the game with no way I'm aware of to reconnect. Added to this is the worse of the two issues, which is the keyboard connection to the game is somehow messed up. It won't allow the use of backspace or enter keys. This breaks in game chat (which exacerbates the other issue, negating the ability to communicate with others while playing). This also breaks private server selection (since the name can't be changed, which is required for selecting the server). In a perfect world, the game wouldn't disconnect every time i switch to my text messaging client. It would also allow reconnection to the same game if I were disconnected. Since the games can take hours, it would also allow saving an online game in progress so it could be reconnected. I'd settle for fixing the keyboard, which would make the game painful and kludgey but at least playable online. My brother's iPhone has no issue with the keyboard. It's a very fun game, just a problematic implementation. Fix the bugs and I'll upgrade my review. And before you suggest it, I have filed a support ticket with Asmodee helpdesk."", 'I would give this a higher rating, but I cannot use items or trade trophies. I tap the cards at the right time but they do not activate. These used to work. I am willing to change my review once this issue is fixed, but until then this is spoiling the game.

Now that this is working properly, I am changing my rating, good fix!', ""My Cuzz told me about this Game. Telling me it works Online or Off. Planes, Trains, Forest, Snowstorms, Beaches, it doesn't matter the Game works. They're right and correct. We 💙 Dice Games anyway. This is by far the best Board Game we've ever played. Smokes others to ash and Left us all impressed. Tons of DLC. Excellent Art, even the Music, I hear Ireland and UK in it, makes me want to Drink. Maybe, there's Hope for this store after all. Thanks so much Nomad!"", 'I have been playing Talisman the boardgame for almost 20 years and this app is a faithful, polished, and very enjoyable adaptation. Learning curve on buttons and turn sequence may be a little steep but the manual is helpful. Most of my playtime has been on airplanes and I am very happy that this does not require an internet connection to play. I have purchased all of the expansions and I feel I have barely scratched the surface of the game.', 'Overall it is true to the game. If you like the physical game this is fun. The interface is quirky - It\'s hard to read things and I wish that zoom was easer to use (pinch 2 zoom without the view mode transitions would be nice - think mac OS). I wish there was a ""back"" option for most things. There are times where ""continue"" means you can no longer change your mind and this can be frustrating. After killing someone at the crown of command I would like a ""quick ignore all items"" button. After killing 2 attackers dismissing 20 items each turn is annoying.', ""Edit: Support got back to me. Uninstalling and reinstalling Google play games resolved the issue! -------------- Original Review: I cannot play Talisman on my pixel 3a.

NOT ONLY IS IT UNLIKE OLD GAME, IT IS POINTLESS AND ANNOYING. WASTE OF TIME, HORRIBLE IN EVERY WAY.

Using Google Nexus 2. OS is up to date. :(. Let me know when you've patched and I'll try again."", ""Earlier, I reported that the AI in this game blatantly cheats. Asmodee replied that they worked hard on the AI, and that it DOESN'T cheat. Okay... sure. I've been playing the actual board game for 20 years...I've seen plenty of people get the EXACT die rolls and cards they need every round, to win the game in less than 50 rounds. That's sarcasm in case it doesn't read clear. Despite this, I still think it's a good digital rendition of the game, so long as you play with other people, not the AI."", ""If you're kinda on the fence about buying a steampunk expansion, it might be reassuring to know that they don't go whole ham into something that's out of place in the game's word. This expansion focuses on a simple crafting mechanic, where you combine three material cards into your own item. While fun with a bit of an addicting quality, be aware that one material turns your item into a Talisman. So it makes the main item you need to pick up to win the game a bit more useless."", ""I bought this game to play with my children. When I first got it, I have to admit I was intimidated by the giant rulebook. However, once you start playing it is easy to catch on to how to play. Also my kids seem to love the game. I broke down and bought the expansions. So far we have only scratched the surface of what is available. I wouldn't be surprised if I change it to 5 stars as we delve in more to what the game has to offer. Thanks for making a great game available on the android."", ""Great game, but there's a couple of faults.... When you pick up Astrologer card, you're supposed to be able to pick a card and place it down when you want. You can pick it up but can't place it down. When doing Warlock Quest ending you get 4 quests but if one of them is the one where you roll the dice, it messes up system and doesn't recognise as a compled quest.Rod of ruin too powerful, taking two lots of strength or craft, should be one...ps after recent update all achievements lost, arghhhh!!!"", ""It is faithful port of the board game. Better in fact as there is no faffing about with the million odd (a slight exaggeration) pieces of card. The let down is Asmodee's player profile functionality and their customer service. I emailed them months ago about how my profile's level had vanished and i had had to start again. They never replied. A similar incidents has just happened again. This time the level and game that previously disappeared has reappeared taking with it my much higher level."", 'Online play is so buggy at the moment some of the bugs include the game crashing when trying to play online, the chat box not working properly and not being able to rejoin games that is if you can find a game on their Barron servers', 'Great game for single player games with Ai but that got boring for me as the dice rolls are not that random and seem to not favor the non ai player. As for the Online side of the game it would be great but you painfully wait scrolling through the barron servers with out knowing if there is anyone is out there maybe the Devs could implement a GLOBAL LOBBY CHAT that shows other players that are connected to all servers or each 1. Maybe a sale/free period to boost multiplayer numbers?', ""I was happily playing until today's update. My current game was deleted, as were my various achievements. Also the game claims I have downloaded 3 extra characters and an expansion pack, all of which is news to me. The game is enjoyable, the updates are not."", ""It's a trap! Avoid. The dice roll odds are skewed to compensate for lack of AI. And you'll be paying $30+ for complete content. This app is like an old shareware game or demo except it isn't even free."", 'Incredible adaptation of the boardgame! There is so much content here and it makes the game feel new every time. The instructions and tutorial make the game very understandable. The AI characters are challenging and the different boards/cards/characters add a ton of variety. The developers did a great job with this game. The interface is easy to use and I like the zoom in action on some of the moves. A living boardgame with a great fantasy theme.', 'The latest update has made the game unplayable on my tablet. I\'m using an RCT6513W87, or an ""RCK Aurora"" android computer tablet. At first, it worked, but after this new update, it now glitches heavily in graphics, or it just crashes before it even starts. Once it\'s fixed, I\'ll update my score, as I -do- love this game. But the app is messed up atm.', 'Played the original board game a fair amount in my youth and found it to be very fun but not terribly deep. This is a faithful digital take on it and this too is light and fun. One complaint though is that I bought this game a while back with the deep realms expansion. Recently I purchased the game and some more expansions (Reaper, Frost March, Martyr, genie) in a Humble Bundle as soon as that version updated it reverted to my previous version and I lost all of the new expansions. Have an email in to Asmodee. Hope they can fix it.', ""Played this game for years and loved it. But each time another update is released, the developers manage to chip away and ruin the game further. The latest update makes the game unplayable - it's now impossible to trade in trophies to upgrade your character, which is the aim of the game! I've given up contacting the developers (proved to be a waste of time)."", ""This game combines all of the absolute worst random elements of Monopoly and risk and wraps it up in a really cool theme.

Highly recommend this app"", ""If you love the board game, this is great. The social element isn't there unless you play locally with friends. But cleanup is so much easier than the board game."", 'Good game but slow animations. The animations are interesting. Once. From there though a game takes literally twice as long to complete just because of the animations. I would give it a five star rating if the animations could be skipped.', 'The TT version of this game can be intimidating because of all of the types of tiles. This is a great way to lean how to play.', ""I love the board game and I love this adaptation. I haven't played online yet but there's a whole campaign feature which is just a thrill to have."", ""I absolutely love this board game, and I am overjoyed that there's a digital version I can play anytime without having to talk someone else into playing."", 'I love this game but I am a bit frustrated with the campaign mode. It glitched out and I can no longer play.', ""Works well, runs great on both my honor 8 and shield k1. Apparently it's just like the board game.

A great game."", 'Not many board games can make a good transition to mobile game. This one does. 5 stars.', ""This game is well put together and great fun, but the story mode is way too short and it'd been nice to have seen a few more adventures."", ""I like it a lot. Worthy of being a vlaada title. One thing though is that the game doesn't pause for my phone notifications so I find myself severely hampered in ship building when I take a text. I mean. I could always turn off notifications but I do need my phone"", ""This is a fun concept. I hadn't played the board game version it's based off, but it's making me want to go and get it."", 'Good game interface, it gives the same vibe than the boardgame! I loved the story behind the campaign, even if I would like it to be more to discover and more to do :)', 'Love the puzzles and game play of this one! I keep coming back to it. The board game is great fun too', ""Very fun and engaging game. If you've played the board game you will love it. If you haven't, it is still really fun and has good explanations and a tutorial. As a dev to devs: There is a bug with catapults and not being able to use them to increase your firepower (canon strength) rating when in a Combat Zone, even though it shows you have the potential to. Also, sometimes it won't let me do online multiplayer because it says I am offline, and it is difficult to get around. Sometimes it is hard to get the little screen-exit x's to function;in one case it doesn't work right."", ""I own the table top version of this game, and it is a staple of my weekly game night. This is a wonderful adaptation that plays more smoothly than any other cardboard-to-mobile port I have ever played. I have even used the tutorial in the app to teach new players before bringing out the physical game. I recommend this app to anyone who has played table top Galaxy Trucker, or even to those who haven't. It's great, just great."", 'This is a great port of a great board game. Some of the ui could be better like picking ship parts but overall things are smooth. Good on a phone and probably great on a tablet.', ""after buying the expansion, pass and play multiplayer games keep crashing when we get to a combat zone (says tap to continue, but it wont let you). you can still access the menu in the top right though to quit, which is what we've had to do. app is great when it works, but when you have to keep quitting your games, it sucks"", 'Excellent game, though it does have a couple bugs.', 'Generally a very good, faithful recreation of the original. A few annoying bugs, however. Notably that my profile keeps getting reset to red so I have to go back and change it back to green regularly :( Overall though, very much worth the money. Some interesting new mechanics and a great adaptation of the board game. PS. The expansion is great, though difficult :D', 'Great game, hundreds of hours spent playing. Campaign is awesome but my favourite mode is custom turned-based against bots with the alien expansion and lots of hard cards. Feature request - last update meant that dialogue confirming you want to finish building is no longer there, so many times I absent mindedly grap that ""1"" tile at the top instead of end turn, my fault but completely ruins the build and have to start over. There used to be a confirmation dialogue if you still had unused spaces', 'As a fussy mobile gamer, I must say that this is a truly fantastic mobile version of a classic board game. The design & implementation is superb. On top of that, the single player campaign is interesting and very humorous, and the pass-and-play mode works well for a family on the road who cannot take the original game with them. The addition of the turn-based build mode is a nice touch, especially for those who find the real-time mode too stressful. Highly recommended. A worthwhile purchase!', ""It's a good adaptation of the board game (with all expansions, i think?). The adventure card animations are a bit slow. The app is great when no one else wants to play. The campaign mode mixes things up a bit - you have to be cautious because your money (or lack thereof) carries through to the next round."", 'Love it. Looking for some more replayability.', 'Fantastic adaptation of the board game that leaves me saying ""This perfectly invokes the feeling of the cardboard version without feeling samey!"" On a side note, I set my favorite color to blue, but it always defaults to green instead. I\'ve tried logging in, updating and saving my profile but it still selects green.', 'Just like the board game. Fun and funny, but the animations are too slow/not skippable.', 'I bought this game to give me an idea of what the board game is like. Pretty fun overall. Takes some thought.', ""Dunno about the boardgame but this version on android is totally sweet. Single player campaign is fun as its not too difficult once you've sussed out the way to play. Have to say that the pc version on steam is identical but cheaper than the android version as it includes the expansion.

But even though the cost is a little leery at $5 I'm glad I did so because it is actually a fun game.I'm not really sure what's good parrot to but you can see the effects of a board game being played here.I think I would have gotten bored pretty quickly if the campaign was it a part of this game but thankfully it's well-crafted and actually pretty funny at times. Highly recommend this game"", 'Fantastic implementation of one of my favorite board games.', 'Faithful implementation of the board game, and the campaign is fun.', ""I had never played galaxy trucker as a boardgame, my experience is only with this adaptation. And it's awesome. I'm very much thinking now of getting the boardgame. Highly recommended to get it."", 'Great game! The board game is solid as a standalone multiplayer game, and the campaign mode adds a whole other fun layer. Easy to learn due to helpful in-game tutorials and help screens.', ""Excellent adaptation of the board game, in fact I think it's superior! Especially like the narrative & persistence of the campaign, something lacking from the board game."", 'As a board game geek, I am very impressed with the tutorial, and gameplay overall. I never played the board version of GT, but this app has turned me into a fan.', 'Works great, single player campaign is fine', 'Good game.

Catan FAQ: 

Question: Why do I have to download additional files after purchasing?
Answer: The download from Google play includes the basic game data and a tool that will determine your device’s display resolution and then download the optimal graphics data for your device.

Question: Which Android security permissions does Catan need and why?
Answer: “Storage” to write data to the SD or move the game data, “Network communication” to download game data and access the In App Store and “system tools” to check if Catan is already running to resume a game.

Question: I bought one of the expansions but after an update, reinstallation of Catan or after restoring my phone the expansion seems gone?
Answer: Don’t worry; your initial purchase is already saved in your Google account. However for technical reasons you might have to select “Buy” again. Confirm and a message will tell you that you’ve already purchased it. You will NOT be billed twice!

Question: I lost my campaign progress after reinstalling, updating from or when restoring my phone. Is there any way to restore it?
Answer: Savegames from old versions can usually be restored automatically. For all other cases we’ve integrated a cheat code: Enter campaign mode and go to select player. Enter „CatanWarp*“ (* = 1–15, e.g ""CatanWarp5"") as your player name and confirm. Exit the game via the home button. Enter your phone’s settings menu. Select applications/manage applications/Catan/ and then “Force Stop”. Restart Catan. The campaign can now be continued from the specified level number by selecting “New scenario *”.

The game will now start again properly on all devices running Android 9","['Online isnt too bad. Rolls and all are good. If you want to play solo id suggest not buying this game. Rolls are quite clearly rigged to give The AI an advanrage but you can still win. (E.g i had all 6 they occupied 8. 6 was rolled 1:7 (against 8 in 5 seperate matches)) But the online is good. No bugs for me so far. Plenty of DCs from other people though. Gameplay is alright.', ""Unbalanced Rubber Band Physics. I love Catan the board game but this is just junk. Rolls favor the AI to the extent it's impossible to win. You can get out ahead but once you do, in the late game you'll get 2-3 resources a round, I didnt have any 8s and I watched it hit 8 four rounds in a row. Then all of a sudden they go from down by 8 to winning placing a road and a settlement each round, and drawing two victory points. Played this game for hours and won 2. Garbage!"", ""This game is a lot of fun! The only problem I've found is that the computer cheats terribly. The true odds of certain numbers being rolled clearly do not apply to this game. So often the computer will make 11s, 12s, 2s, and 3s roll more often if it benefits the computer. There have been so many times where I clearly should be getting more resources, but the computer gets more and they get all the opportune development cards. Catan needs to make the dice more realistic."", 'Great game by itself. Works well playing against other real people. Solo play is good except there is no real scaling of the AI players and the developers obviously could not resist messing with the dice rolls (not purely random). Hate it when they think they can enhance the game experience this way. So solo can be frustrating but everything else is great.', 'Love the game. Have played it for many years, however, for the 6+ months it is prone to crashing during game play. I normally have it crash 3 times per game. (Game duration usually in the 20 minute neighborhood). I would love to give it 5 stars, but stability needs to be returned to the app.', ""I bought this app to play Catan on my phone. Just me. No multi-player. I have downloaded the app and tried everything I could to get it running. The tutorial and other features work just fine, but when I try to launch the game, the screen goes white and the game will not load. What a great racket; take your customers' money and give them nothing useful in return."", 'Love this game as a board game, but as an app it has some serious bugs. The worst of wich is that every time I get a new phone it keeps forcing me to pay for the app again, even though I am using the same account. Google then encourages me to open some family sharing plan..? What the? Sorry, I would rather invest in the real game, thanks..', ""This is a solid and good game for single player. The dice are not rigged. The fact is, they show people the distribution of random rolls. Because of this, everyone assumes it's cheating because it doesn't match the bell curve. There are varying degrees of AI depending on who you play against. They are all beatable. This interface is less tedious and easier to use than Catan Universe at a fraction of the price. Multiplayer over the internet needs some work, but I've played good games there."", ""The game is fine, enjoyable for the most part. People do complain that the game is fixed, and it is a little. The computer will team up against you, even when you are losing or there are better options, and rolling 7's seems to affect you more than the computers. Even the roll of the dice, but it's not to over the top, and it's not every game. You can always just restart the game if it is way over the top."", ""Play against AI on hard mode is a little frustrating, the dice favor the computer. But, overall it's a decent game. If you like Catan as much as I do then you will probably like this app even though it isn't perfect."", ""I bought this app to be able to play with my friends online. The app is broken. Several of us never received our verification emails and now we can't even use the whole app. The only thing we can do is play with AIs, and even then it isn't fun because it's like the dice roll numbers only beneficial to the AIs. I want my money back."", ""I play this board game often. What I seriously hate about playing this on the phone is getting robbed every turn. Seriously...the 7 rolls constantly. It's truly aggravating. The button to get to trades, dice is tucked away you often hit it when trying get get to your phone's home screen. Bad location. Need dedicated roll button outside of this menu. Also, playing online with friends is so annoying. You leave the game even for a minute, when you get back to the app crashes."", 'This game is a rip off. I wish I could give it 0 stars. The rolls are unreasonably unfair. It`s rolls are weighted against you by half and any points you don`t have are quadrupled chances. If you get even 1 point ahead of the computer, it won`t trade with you on ur turn, PERIOD! And if you get lucky enough to get 2 points ahead it won`t` trade with you at all, plus the rolls become even more unbalanced in favor of the computer. Avoid this game.', 'Totally unbalanced, you can never win even on easiest mode. The dice will ALWAYS favor AI, you will always get screwed even if you are loaded up with the best numbers (6 or 8) AI will win with back to back harder numbers (12 or 2). I bought the game yesterday, have been playing for MANY HOURS, me against 2 AI players, they ALWAYS WIN! I give up. Uninstalling!', ""The game needs improvements. The AI cheating constantly in single player mode. The free version of the game it's easier to play for beginners especially. The free version is better than this one."", 'Every time I have to move the robber, I am unable to make another play/continue with the game. The screen isn\'t frozen, it just stays on the robber without letting me or the ""robots"" I\'m playing against, continue', 'I enjoy the game very much but since buying the expansions my popup menus (resources, progress cards, etc) randomly are blank. I have to close the game and open again to get them to appear again. Also, I hate that I have to read and agree to your privacy policies almost every time I start the app, which means I have enter my name and opponents all over again. Fix those issues and I will definitely update to 5 stars!', 'Purchased this game only recently and can not confirm my log in to play online...it tells me my registration is still pending and to check my inbox but I never received an e- mail... please fix because I want to keep on or better said start playing ...was also looking to buy the expansions ...', 'Updated: The online version doesn\'t work. I paid for this app, but even if you\'re able to register, the online version wont start. Disapointing Second problem has to do with the game fairness. I played over 200 games at ""Hard"" level and it\'s very difficult to win. Not because the robots are ""smart"", but because the dices distribution changes. the probability of getting a 2 on each dice is around 3%. the probablility of gettting three consecutive 2 is 0.01%. However, you\'ll see that happening a lot if you play against the computer. Suddenly you\'re leading by 5 points and the dices roll are highly biased towards the computer and then you finally loose. The developpers of this game clearly took a shortcut to make this level ""hard"", which brings out the fun of the game. Conclusion: Very fun game in real, but the app has serious flaws that makes it not enjoyable.', ""Software was written by evil people. Random Number Generator is a joke, some numbers that aren't yours will repeat at up to 8 times in a row. Frustrating to say the least ....."", ""Love the game but most times play single player. My only complaint is the unusual dice results and game actions. Once the human leads, the game seems to change, suddenly the normal mathematical probability of the dice shifts to favor the game, the robber will constantly find it's way to the human's tiles and the number seven just keeps coming. It feels like it's a calculated intent to even the game or change the advantage to the computer. Enjoy playing but often frustrates like crazy."", ""Great looking design and function but absolutely terrible AI. It's basically 3 vs 1 every game and with no difficulty settings it really makes the game unbearable to play"", ""Assuming you're even able to connect to their servers, you'll find that this classic and iconic board game has been made into a horribly buggy app. More frustrating than fun. There are better ways to waste your time."", ""I love this app. My mother-in-law is in the hospital in isolation. I would like to play Settlers of Catan with her to keep her occupied and engaged. I have been playing Catan Classic for the last couple years but now I cannot login to play online. I don't get a reset password email when I click the button. My mother-in-law cannot create an online account. She uses an iPad and hospital WiFi. Are your online servers having issues? Any help would be appreciated."", ""Has been freezing or going to a gray screen recently despite recent update. Wont get past initial screen. Disappointing since I've paid for some expansions and enjoy playing on the chromebook."", 'Locks up on launch with just a gray screen. The ""level"" of the AI really just affects how bad the cheating is with the dice. Lots of other little bugs. Often hides the other players paper level so you don\'t know whether you\'re going to be rewarded for a 5th level or not. Not as buggy as it used to be other than the really annoying grey screen that takes about 20 launch and kill cycles to get past. Waiting forever with a grey screen at launch doesn\'t help.', ""Tried to register for online play but never received a verification email to confirm my account and therefore was unable to play with friends (waited 20 minutes and decided to refund). Update to response: USM, I'm not an idiot. I checked my spam folder and even created another email address to register a second time. My wife also downloaded the game and had the same problem. When I pay for an App I expect it to work.

Backgammon is a game of skill and strategy; one of the world's classic parlour board games, played for recreation and gambling. Like Mahjong, Backgammon is played in social groups in coffee houses and bars. Historically, variants of this game are believed to have originated in Egypt over 3000 years ago, from where it was adopted by the Romans and then later travelled to India. It also spread to East Asia, but was largely replaced by Xiangqi (Chinese chess). It is now very popular in the West.

Shelter: A Survival Card Game,com.shelter_droid.shelter,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.shelter_droid.shelter&hl=en&gl=us,"Shelter is an exciting new zombie card-dueling game.

Playing like a hybrid of a collectible card game and the castle defense genre, Shelter will provide you with hours of challenging play.

Defend yourself from the zombie onslaught as you fight to be reunited with the woman you love. You define your strategy, but be warned...

...You'll need to adapt to survive.

Features:

- Deep but accessible gameplay. Easy to learn. Hard to master.
- More than 100 game cards.
- Integrated deck builder for deeply customizable play.
- Graphic novel & comic inspired hand drawn artwork.
- Compelling story and characters.
- 5 Campaign levels including a free roaming level.

Details:

The inspiration for Shelter comes from the desire to combine the complex, rich gaming mechanics of collectible card dueling games with the simple accessible gameplay of the castle defense genre.

Shelter is an asymmetric single-player card game where you build a deck of dueling cards and take them into battle against a zombie deck that ""plays itself"". The zombie deck is not controlled by a hideously complex AI, but plays based on a simple set of rules with dice rolls to add the element of chance. You must fight off the waves of zombies before they smash your shelter's barricades and start munching on your brains.

You choose your survival strategy when you build your deck. Do you pack as many guns into your deck as you can? Do you use traps and reinforce your defenses? Do you stun stronger zombies and pick off the weak ones? You have the freedom to play as you want.

As you win duels, you will be rewarded with new cards to work into your deck and streamline your play style. You will also meet allies throughout the campaign who you take into battle with you. Each ally brings 5 themed cards to the table that allow you to experience different styles of play.",Zombie card duelling in a graphic novel style - tasty!,"10,000+",10000,4.391813,1720,430,1.99,False,USD,,46M,2.3,Survivalist Games,8401944924818644128,feedback@survivalistgames.co.uk,http://www.survivalistgames.co.uk/shelter,http://www.survivalistgames.co.uk/privacy/,8401944924818644128,Board,GAME_BOARD,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/X5yaAnC2YNjS74iaZaPj_TJDcaePV0ovpHu_GtaI6w_MQd6omeUtbQ4Gi14srTrfPIpU,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Ui8HqFs-keeLjCmaRnmEVZxO4hOllQTzk47h-256-kpVfHao2wK7sjBgoX_xsKCwqQ,Teen,"Violence, Blood",,,"May 31, 2013",1447278121,2.1.19,"[FIX] Fixed out-of-order issues when repeatedly playing comic sequences

I thoroughly enjoyed playing it and revisit it every now and then for a quick battle.  The game play and UI flows relatively quick and smooth. My only qualm is that the animations for zombies dying are slow. As it is now, when a zombie card is killed, it has an animation of the cards being stretched out horizontally and then a few seconds later the box it was occupying reverses the stretch and re-appears empty. It would be much more preferable to have the card simply be removed, or at most, slide the card into the discard pile.

You can power through it quickly, or take your time, and it is definitely repayable when you feel like taking another run at it."", ""Glad I stumbled across this gem of a game. It's a single player card game with ccg aspects that pits you against swarming zombie hoards. Most impressive is how well the game encapsulates the feeling of escaping a zombie attack. You start out safely behind you barricades, buffing up while firing shots at the approaching hoard. Before long they break down your defenses, you are low on ammo, and you rush to find whatever melee weapon you can to bash your way to the exit. Lots of zombie and weapon traits keep things interesting. I love the comic style artwork, although would like a little higher rez images since I play on a larger tablet. A few UI improvements, such being able to see your whole hand at once, would be nice too. Still, definetly a game worth checking out."", ""After losing, if I want to play again, the zombies got their cards, but I won't.

It has only two problems but they are serious. First, the quarantine specialist is broken and does not follow the boardgame rules. Second, you are far more likely to have outbreaks than in the boardgame. Updated: yup. The city you get three cubes in during an epidemic is then chosen during the follow on infection phase far more often than should be possible. Its a sad, obvious cheat. Update: Resilient Population often co-occurs with Epidemic.', 'This game is really well done and true to all the board game rules. I didn\'t notice any of the ""bugs"" some others had reported. I believe several of the bug reports are actually just people misunderstanding the board game rules in some areas. Outbreaks will naturally occur often if treatments aren\'t controlled really well. The discards of the recently infected cities go back on top of deck each time an epidemic card is drawn (which is also how the original board game was designed).', ""Excellent game; love the layout, the sound effects, the outbreak graphics.

So cheap and I can't wait to get 'on the brink' and 'in the lab'"", ""The game play is fun and I really like the game, but I feel like something is wrong with the randomness coding. I'm an intelligent person who plays games like this all the time, both digital and board. I've played at least 50+ times on the easiest level and I've only won one time. I feel like the odds on that are stacked against me. It makes it not fun when you just can't win."", ""Great app, plays just like the boardgame. I purchased the 'virulent strain' (which has plummeted our success rate 😉) and 'on the brink' add-ons. There's a bug which adds another player (Kelly) with a random job whenever 'on the brink'' is turned on, and you should be able to disable 'info' mid-game.. aside from those issues, great job!"", ""I've played this game on a GalaxyS8 for over a year and had one or two minor glitches. Notable one being when closing a game, rebooting and returning to it once in a while will not allow you to undo previous saved action. Aside from that it's been great and is true to the board game. It's nice to play the app to get good practice. It's possible to beat the game even on Legendary with Virulent Strain. My only wish is for Asmodee to continue adding all the expansions. I'd buy them in a heart beat."", ""I love the boardgame, but this was a huge disappointment. The algorithm is completely messed up so it is frustratingly impossible to beat. Just hoping an update will be made that fixed it, because I refuse to play until it's actually possible to win. The original game is difficult but possible to win. This version is not."", 'Seems to be an accurate representation of the board game.

Played my first game and won. It got down to the wire. Had 9 cards left in the deck and like 4 outbreaks. But it was fun. If you know the board game and can play well then you should have no problem. Again, maybe RNG-eezus was on my side, but I found the have really fun and enjoyable. It was a 2 player game. Researcher and engineer specialist I think? Would love for this to be an online multiplayer game."", ""I love this game. It reminds me of Elder signs. Not so much in the gameplay, but in the fact that it is a very very hard game to beat.

Boom epidemic, bottom next to 3 city, then 3 city, then just epidemiced city went from 2 to 5 outbreaks! Seen this same thing over and over. I quit"", 'This version is a lot more difficult to win than the board game version. Even on the easiest setting, you need quite a bit of luck in order to win.

Great for enjoying the Pandemic-experience while on the go.', 'I absolutely love this game. I play the board game a little more than i use the app, currently playing through Pandemic: Legacy every monday with a few friends (highly recommend it if you havent played it, a neat weekly twist on the original game). If I had one request of this game, it would be to allow casting to a Chromecast enabled device to be able to see the entire map while playing, kind of like what the app version of RISK does. Otherwise, this is a solid digital board game!', ""So addictive I bought the boardgame too! Intuitive UI, and uncluttered considering all the game's variables. You play 4-5 roles at a time. I love the collaborative aspect; it's everyone against the game--but I wish there were an online version so I could play with other users! Maybe an update someday? I've had so much fun playing the boardgame with friends, and would love to be able to play remotely."", ""It's a good game. But there are a couple of bugs. First, the ability to see all the players cards disappears at times. To continue the game you have to close the game completely and relaunch. Secondly, in one of the extensions, the special orders card seems to have no effect on either the player whose turn it is or on the player chosen when the card is played. Sort out the bugs and it's *****"", ""This review is just a warning to others. This app has multiple bugs that have been reported numerous times but the app itself hasn't been updated since 2016. So you are buying an abandoned app that will never see another update or bug fix. Whoever operates the developer's Google account occasionally responds to reviews but they never fix anything. Buyer beware!"", 'App is REALLY well done. It reflects the board game well and the graphics are smooth as butter. You\'re able to control every aspect of the game that you control at home (ex: Number of players. Which characters you get or if you want random.) The ONLY thing I\'m ""meh"" about is with the max of 7 cards, at home if you transfer an 8th card we play where you can cure a disease if that drops you back to <7, but this app makes you get rid of a diff card and THEN cure which I feel like is a lil unfair.', ""Bugs, resilient population doesn't work, every time I use it, the card I remove from the game ends up at the top of the reshuffled deck.

Not to mention the number of epidemics that occur and then get intensified makes the game impossible to win. It certainly doesn't play well.

Requested refund on app. Disappointed it would not work. One of my favorite board games.', 'Random card are not random but they rather punish you. Whenever there is an epidemic the top card is most likely to be the city where it occurred so it makes it impossible to beat the game.

Pandemic Legacy would be a great addition.', ""I've been wanting this game for a while now so yesterday I decided to buy it! It honestly took me a while to get through the tutorial and it took a while to understand the whole thing, but now since I gotten the hang of it, it's an awesome game! Keep up the great work!"", 'Love pandemic. Love the extra modes. Love the challenges for Google play games.', 'Plays very much like the board game, and is just as hard. I is amazing that they could cram all the different things that you have to track, and have it easy to understand.', 'Good (paid) game scarred by IAPs. Pay to play, pay to win.

However I can't give it a full five stars because of two issues that combine to make online play almost impossible. One, tabbing out of the app to switch to any other screen (text messaging client for instance) will disconnect the player from the game with no way I'm aware of to reconnect. Added to this is the worse of the two issues, which is the keyboard connection to the game is somehow messed up. It won't allow the use of backspace or enter keys. This breaks in game chat (which exacerbates the other issue, negating the ability to communicate with others while playing). This also breaks private server selection (since the name can't be changed, which is required for selecting the server). In a perfect world, the game wouldn't disconnect every time i switch to my text messaging client. It would also allow reconnection to the same game if I were disconnected. Since the games can take hours, it would also allow saving an online game in progress so it could be reconnected. I'd settle for fixing the keyboard, which would make the game painful and kludgey but at least playable online. My brother's iPhone has no issue with the keyboard. It's a very fun game, just a problematic implementation. Fix the bugs and I'll upgrade my review. And before you suggest it, I have filed a support ticket with Asmodee helpdesk."", 'I would give this a higher rating, but I cannot use items or trade trophies. I tap the cards at the right time but they do not activate. These used to work. I am willing to change my review once this issue is fixed, but until then this is spoiling the game.

Now that this is working properly, I am changing my rating, good fix!', ""My Cuzz told me about this Game. Telling me it works Online or Off. Planes, Trains, Forest, Snowstorms, Beaches, it doesn't matter the Game works. They're right and correct. We 💙 Dice Games anyway. This is by far the best Board Game we've ever played. Smokes others to ash and Left us all impressed. Tons of DLC. Excellent Art, even the Music, I hear Ireland and UK in it, makes me want to Drink. Maybe, there's Hope for this store after all. Thanks so much Nomad!"", 'I have been playing Talisman the boardgame for almost 20 years and this app is a faithful, polished, and very enjoyable adaptation. Learning curve on buttons and turn sequence may be a little steep but the manual is helpful. Most of my playtime has been on airplanes and I am very happy that this does not require an internet connection to play. I have purchased all of the expansions and I feel I have barely scratched the surface of the game.', 'Overall it is true to the game. If you like the physical game this is fun. The interface is quirky - It\'s hard to read things and I wish that zoom was easer to use (pinch 2 zoom without the view mode transitions would be nice - think mac OS). I wish there was a ""back"" option for most things. There are times where ""continue"" means you can no longer change your mind and this can be frustrating. After killing someone at the crown of command I would like a ""quick ignore all items"" button. After killing 2 attackers dismissing 20 items each turn is annoying.', ""Edit: Support got back to me. Uninstalling and reinstalling Google play games resolved the issue! -------------- Original Review: I cannot play Talisman on my pixel 3a.

Once the issue is fixed I will update my review."", ""Pretty decent game.

This expansion focuses on a simple crafting mechanic, where you combine three material cards into your own item.

At first, it worked, but after this new update, it now glitches heavily in graphics, or it just crashes before it even starts. Once it\'s fixed, I\'ll update my score, as I -do- love this game. But the app is messed up atm.', 'Played the original board game a fair amount in my youth and found it to be very fun but not terribly deep. This is a faithful digital take on it and this too is light and fun. One complaint though is that I bought this game a while back with the deep realms expansion. Recently I purchased the game and some more expansions (Reaper, Frost March, Martyr, genie) in a Humble Bundle as soon as that version updated it reverted to my previous version and I lost all of the new expansions. Have an email in to Asmodee. Hope they can fix it.', ""Played this game for years and loved it. But each time another update is released, the developers manage to chip away and ruin the game further. The latest update makes the game unplayable - it's now impossible to trade in trophies to upgrade your character, which is the aim of the game! I've given up contacting the developers (proved to be a waste of time)."", ""This game combines all of the absolute worst random elements of Monopoly and risk and wraps it up in a really cool theme. You hardly realize that you're literally just rolling Dice and watching things happen to your character because everything has a genuine thematic feel to it. There's no strategy. there's no planning. there is only rolling Dice and trying to kill your friends.""]"

Multi-tasking: despite the app claiming you can still use multitasking while in a game, in my experience, any switching away from the game will Force you out of the game.

There are few other bugs as well but I've run out room."", 'Game is good but some update has caused game not to open. Have emailed game/app provider on 3 occasions to seek help.

I don't give 5stars because there are expansions that are displayed but cannot be purchased. The two that can be had are the two that don't use in the hard copy of the the game.

I just left a 4 person Cities match online be cause there were only enough tokens for a 2 player match. I've experienced glitches that allow dead players to time out way passed the 2 min allowance.

I would highly recommend it, IF it was working. Until then I'd have to suggest caution in buying it."", ""Good adaptation of a great board game. Maybe a bit too easy, so far I won every time by aiming for the nobles. Really cool on big Chromebook touchscreens except for one big issue: a GLThread drains the battery in no time.

This app keeps getting worse.I used to be able to go online and play with other people but that stopped months ago. Even though I paid I can't use it.now you frequently have to stop the game because it will not let you go forward if there are not enough chips to get three. No more end turn button if you can only get one or two chips instead of three. Very disappointing this app keeps getting worse."", ""Splendor- the underlying card game- is a fine game, and one I recommend. As of very recently, however, the app will not open without file and photo permissions that I do not lightly give, nor- importantly- did the game ever need for regular operations before.

I play the solo game only so I can't comment on the online play."", ""Should show what happened on previous turns, even with a quick animation. Absolutely needs to display until player accepts, any cards which other players bank during turn animation. Letting players bank cards without showing changes the game immensely.

The tense excitement of Elder Sign is now available for Android! Elder Sign: Omens places you in control of up to four intrepid investigators, as they fight to keep all-powerful Ancient Ones from invading our world through a museum’s arcane exhibits! 

*Build a team of unique investigators* 
*Explore an ever-changing museum* 
*Face challenging arcane tasks* 
*Save the world from absolute destruction*
*Expand the horror with two exciting in-app purchases*

Can you stand against the impending arrival of a malevolent Ancient One? 


While Elder Sign: Omens brilliantly conveys the spirit of the Elder Sign dice game, a few noteworthy differences were adopted to optimize the mobile play experience: 

-A limited number of available Ancient Ones streamlines the game play experience while offering adjustable levels of difficulty. Face Yig in normal mode, Azathoth or Tsathoggua in hard mode, or Cthulhu or Ithaqua in very hard mode (in-app purchases required to face Cthulhu and Ithaqua).
-A number of subtle changes increase the peril of defending humanity. For example, the random negative effects drawn every midnight are more challenging, and the frequency of “no effect” results has been decreased. Monsters have likewise been altered to make them more difficult. 
-Finally, there are no Ally cards in Elder Sign: Omens, which further streamlines play while increasing the overall challenge.",The tense excitement of Elder Sign is now available for Android,"100,000+",100000,4.377647,9970,2694,1.99,False,USD,True,31M,2.3,Fantasy Flight Games,Fantasy+Flight+Games,softwaresupport@fantasyflightgames.com,http://www.fantasyflightgames.com,https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/more/privacy-policy/,6895213484937988323,Board,GAME_BOARD,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ZrqstUKOgrR7hGesFSZds_onTrGczsUib0tqWSrnuX0Sfn1CLM5Fhmuc7yhWH026LpE,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/oiK6OWowEW6hhdCnrhTu6jE3VP7V_2AljIPhIabWGvbVtxdS7MJ49KgK3JIAjS_00Tc,Everyone,Alcohol and Tobacco Reference,,,"Nov 2, 2011",1549924116,1.5.3,Fixed black screen startup issue with Android 8+ devices.,"[""More rigged against the player than the original board game.

But if you take the time to read the help section to understand the rules, you will be rewarded by a very intense and engaging game. This is a hard game, don't expect an easy win. It is arkham light, but for a mobile game thats a good thing! Its quick to pick up and play on the run. I was skeptical of the dice mechanic at first, but there is plenty of strategy and tactical thinking involved."", ""A mediocre deck building affair whose engaging artwork and well judged musical score can't overcome its dryness. That said, I was fairly engaged with the meta-game, before discovering, on completing the four basic challenges, that the three locked campaigns (which I'd anticipated were the meat of the game) actually represented another £7 worth of paid content!.

There are some relatively minor differences from the tabletop version and it is harder. But for whatever it's worth, I have not lost on easy, and win about half the time on medium and hard.

I got a refund immediately. My $11 can better be spent elsewhere.', ""The dice are RIGGED. The actual board game is 10 times easier than this. I seldom lose a game with the actual elder sign board game (and if you read the reviews of the board game, most people think it's too easy, especially the vanilla game), whereas I lose almost every single game with the mobile version, and that's saying something.

I love this game but doom +2 at midnight is totally unfair and really spoils this game.

We in fact prefer to play this over the physical game now.

So every time we come to play the game, we have to start over. Very frustrating!', ""The game itself is fun but the online multiplayer experience is horrendous, at least till you reach high levels. If your opponent decides they don't like their cards, they can sit there for the *full 10/15 minutes or more* of their turn blocking you from playing, and forcing you to either wait it out or suffer the penalty for quitting yourself. It desperately needs an individual turn timer.

I purchased the USA board and added the 1910 expansion. My issues began after realizing how much data it demanded for online play. Soon I found that I was only going to be able to play the Solo mode. This was disappointing too, because the bots are programmed only to play trains and rarely even complete their routes. It may be useful to try new boards before making a physical purchase?', ""This is really a great game, however, this electronic version does not seem to accept the fact that add-ons were paid for. I have to repeatedly log out and log back on the server, which occasionally works to be able to use the game as paid for. This software doesn't seem stable enough. The add ins were paid for, but are not available to use... Update, customer service was able to correct all issues! It would be 5 star if they didn't charge for every small add on. It is a fun multiplayer game."", ""This was a pretty stable game, but over last month has been really buggy. Some maps I can't play at all. Sometimes freezes right in the middle of play.

Unfortunately after the latest update, the game fails to start. It freezes when with a spinning circle and will not reach the title screen. Force closing, restarting game or phone, clearing settings, reinstalling all fail to fix it. One star review until this is fixed. Edit: The issue appears fixed. The game is great otherwise, so score restored.', ""Much better after the last updates. The major issue with this game is still the scoring system. Once you get over about 1600 there aren't enough players with a similar rank to play with, and a loss against a weaker player is punitive. Winning a 4 player game gives you fewer points than someone who comes a distant second. And the margin by which is won should be taken into consideration in the scoring. One niggle is the black bar that drops down and covers the top of the map. But much improved"", ""Devs need to enable the ability to kick a player who quits the game without exiting. After waiting in multiple games 10 minutes or more for a bot to take over for an inconsiderate player, only to find someone else has done this as well, I've had it. 3 stars at best until the devs solve this. Uninstalling. Sucks that I paid $$ and this has not been addressed. Should at least have a turn time limit."", 'Would expect more from the price tag. I think they should release the beta for free until it gets more developed. Crashes from quite a few unhandled errors. Quite slow to start. Kicks you from game when wifi or data connection drops even momentarily rather than wait and handle revonnection. The onResume functionality is VERY slow. Maybe this was developed for another OS and ported to Android? The game itself is fun, but it needs some work for a smooth mobile experience.', ""It seems that there is no hand limit for this game, and I don't see an option to turn that on or off as a choice. If the game is set for unlimited cards in your hand, that is a dreadful choice of the creators. To be able to hold all the cards you want, then slam down your tracks in one continuous run is ridiculous. There's little strategy, just hope you get your hand of cards before the other does. Bad bad choice."", ""It's a great game but for the life of me I cannot buy any of the expansions. I've tried doing so through the game and now the website. In the game I tap on the price but it doesn't bring up Google Play for me to purchase the expansions. Fun game, wish I could give it more stars."", 'Would have given this game a 5* review before buying Europe expansion. Unfortunately Europe 1912 Mega simply does not work: I can choose the initial tickets but afterwards the game does not allow to build routes or take cards. This is very disappointing for a paid expansion.', ""The timer had glitch issues. Every game it counts form my time when it's the opponents. Only 25-50 people online/in the lobby on a weekend evening. Music is fine but repeats every five seconds. You need to create a room as you need 20+ points games to play in another room, or most buy maps, grr. At least opponents join my room within half a minute. The app is handy for confirming things, but there is no undo. The time limit is useful, 10 minutes I recommend. But with the app glitches,+mins"", ""Login fails.

When I can play properly the mechanics and interface overall is brilliant so i gave the stars it deserved."", ""Game lies. No cross play between Android and iOS. They have been aware of this issue for over a month based on similar complaints but the problem persists. Extremely disappointed, getting a refund and submitting a complaint to Google. Re dev response: Game was fully updated. It's your responsibility to make a statement saying that functionality is compromised. You were made aware of it over a month before my post ergo you were falsely advertising features that you knew didn't exist for a month."", 'Very good indeed, like the board game. imho the best are Switzerland and Pennsylvania: good versions to play and seem to reflect a real knowledge of the locations. The basic USA and Europe are great too, as are the Nordic countries and India. Avoid UK, nothing like the geography of the country and obscure rules, and France which has a weird rule of chosing the colour of the route before you claim it. Incredible value for money', ""Keeps forgetting my sound settings, extremely annoying. The sound settings issue was worked around by logging in, but it still does not save them otherwise. Recently it forgets my login every day, so I've had to relogin and then redo my sound settings. Today I tried uninstalling and reinstalling to see if that helped. I won't know until tomorrow, but now it is stuck on speed level 1, so it's basically unplayable.

Backgammon is a game of skill and strategy; one of the world's classic parlour board games, played for recreation and gambling. Like Mahjong, Backgammon is played in social groups in coffee houses and bars. Historically, variants of this game are believed to have originated in Egypt over 3000 years ago, from where it was adopted by the Romans and then later travelled to India. It also spread to East Asia, but was largely replaced by Xiangqi (Chinese chess). It is now very popular in the West.

I also like that you can speed the game graphics up and play fast games if you want to. My only critique is that if you're more of an advanced player the AI is not very competitive even on level 5."", ""Best backgammon game I've ever played.

But, having thrashed my AI competitor by doubling up to 64 at Level 5 following a series of losses because of the high number of doubles that were played against me have concluded that because this is a game of chance i have to play the optimum moves on each throw otherwise the emotionless logic of the program will always win.', 'EDIT: Went from 3 stars to 5...they fixed the issue! ORIGINAL REVIEW: designed with lots of features to make the game play faster, BUT when it comes to the computer taking pieces off the board, it often ""plays"" stupid. I want to win honestly. I mean seriously, if you have 8 pieces in the ""1"" position and you roll double ones, you take four off the board. This game will have the computer move pieces over and take NOTHING off the board.

Dumb asses! The cheat is so bad, it is predictable! I can predict with 99% what the computer is going to roll! Pathetic! Sit down with a pair of dice and the cheat becomes even more obvious! I wrote games for UNIX you morons! You can't even count on your fingers!😂"", ""Great game for a new player (wish there were more tutorials). The animations are nice; movements are simple. Level 1 play is suitably winnable for a n00b. I'm not advanced enough to judge the higher levels yet. My only wish is that there were some strategy tutorials in here, like you get with a lot of chess apps, etc."", ""DO NOT PURCHASE! COMPLETE SCAM! DICE ROLLS ARE COMPLETELY RIGGED!

Highly recommend this game"", 'Fantastic implementation of one of my favorite board games.', 'Faithful implementation of the board game, and the campaign is fun.', ""I had never played galaxy trucker as a boardgame, my experience is only with this adaptation. And it's awesome. I'm very much thinking now of getting the boardgame. Highly recommended to get it."", 'Great game! The board game is solid as a standalone multiplayer game, and the campaign mode adds a whole other fun layer. Easy to learn due to helpful in-game tutorials and help screens.', ""Excellent adaptation of the board game, in fact I think it's superior! Especially like the narrative & persistence of the campaign, something lacking from the board game."", 'As a board game geek, I am very impressed with the tutorial, and gameplay overall. I never played the board version of GT, but this app has turned me into a fan.', 'Works great, single player campaign is fine', 'Good game. It looked simple at first but then you started getting some interesting missions, and gameplay progression was quite good.']"

Catan FAQ: 

Question: Why do I have to download additional files after purchasing?
Answer: The download from Google play includes the basic game data and a tool that will determine your device’s display resolution and then download the optimal graphics data for your device.

Question: Which Android security permissions does Catan need and why?
Answer: “Storage” to write data to the SD or move the game data, “Network communication” to download game data and access the In App Store and “system tools” to check if Catan is already running to resume a game.

Question: I bought one of the expansions but after an update, reinstallation of Catan or after restoring my phone the expansion seems gone?
Answer: Don’t worry; your initial purchase is already saved in your Google account. However for technical reasons you might have to select “Buy” again. Confirm and a message will tell you that you’ve already purchased it. You will NOT be billed twice!

Question: I lost my campaign progress after reinstalling, updating from or when restoring my phone. Is there any way to restore it?
Answer: Savegames from old versions can usually be restored automatically. For all other cases we’ve integrated a cheat code: Enter campaign mode and go to select player. Enter „CatanWarp*“ (* = 1–15, e.g ""CatanWarp5"") as your player name and confirm. Exit the game via the home button. Enter your phone’s settings menu. Select applications/manage applications/Catan/ and then “Force Stop”. Restart Catan. The campaign can now be continued from the specified level number by selecting “New scenario *”.

The game will now start again properly on all devices running Android 9","['Online isnt too bad. Rolls and all are good. If you want to play solo id suggest not buying this game. Rolls are quite clearly rigged to give The AI an advanrage but you can still win. (E.g i had all 6 they occupied 8. 6 was rolled 1:7 (against 8 in 5 seperate matches)) But the online is good. No bugs for me so far. Plenty of DCs from other people though. Gameplay is alright.', ""Unbalanced Rubber Band Physics. I love Catan the board game but this is just junk. Rolls favor the AI to the extent it's impossible to win. You can get out ahead but once you do, in the late game you'll get 2-3 resources a round, I didnt have any 8s and I watched it hit 8 four rounds in a row. Then all of a sudden they go from down by 8 to winning placing a road and a settlement each round, and drawing two victory points. Played this game for hours and won 2. Garbage!"", ""This game is a lot of fun! The only problem I've found is that the computer cheats terribly. The true odds of certain numbers being rolled clearly do not apply to this game. So often the computer will make 11s, 12s, 2s, and 3s roll more often if it benefits the computer. There have been so many times where I clearly should be getting more resources, but the computer gets more and they get all the opportune development cards. Catan needs to make the dice more realistic."", 'Great game by itself. Works well playing against other real people. Solo play is good except there is no real scaling of the AI players and the developers obviously could not resist messing with the dice rolls (not purely random). Hate it when they think they can enhance the game experience this way. So solo can be frustrating but everything else is great.', 'Love the game. Have played it for many years, however, for the 6+ months it is prone to crashing during game play. I normally have it crash 3 times per game. (Game duration usually in the 20 minute neighborhood). I would love to give it 5 stars, but stability needs to be returned to the app.', ""I bought this app to play Catan on my phone. Just me. No multi-player. I have downloaded the app and tried everything I could to get it running. The tutorial and other features work just fine, but when I try to launch the game, the screen goes white and the game will not load. What a great racket; take your customers' money and give them nothing useful in return."", 'Love this game as a board game, but as an app it has some serious bugs. The worst of wich is that every time I get a new phone it keeps forcing me to pay for the app again, even though I am using the same account. Google then encourages me to open some family sharing plan..? What the? Sorry, I would rather invest in the real game, thanks..', ""This is a solid and good game for single player. The dice are not rigged. The fact is, they show people the distribution of random rolls. Because of this, everyone assumes it's cheating because it doesn't match the bell curve. There are varying degrees of AI depending on who you play against. They are all beatable. This interface is less tedious and easier to use than Catan Universe at a fraction of the price. Multiplayer over the internet needs some work, but I've played good games there."", ""The game is fine, enjoyable for the most part. People do complain that the game is fixed, and it is a little. The computer will team up against you, even when you are losing or there are better options, and rolling 7's seems to affect you more than the computers. Even the roll of the dice, but it's not to over the top, and it's not every game. You can always just restart the game if it is way over the top."", ""Play against AI on hard mode is a little frustrating, the dice favor the computer. But, overall it's a decent game. If you like Catan as much as I do then you will probably like this app even though it isn't perfect."", ""I bought this app to be able to play with my friends online. The app is broken. Several of us never received our verification emails and now we can't even use the whole app. The only thing we can do is play with AIs, and even then it isn't fun because it's like the dice roll numbers only beneficial to the AIs. I want my money back."", ""I play this board game often. What I seriously hate about playing this on the phone is getting robbed every turn. Seriously...the 7 rolls constantly. It's truly aggravating. The button to get to trades, dice is tucked away you often hit it when trying get get to your phone's home screen. Bad location. Need dedicated roll button outside of this menu. Also, playing online with friends is so annoying. You leave the game even for a minute, when you get back to the app crashes."", 'This game is a rip off. I wish I could give it 0 stars. The rolls are unreasonably unfair. It`s rolls are weighted against you by half and any points you don`t have are quadrupled chances. If you get even 1 point ahead of the computer, it won`t trade with you on ur turn, PERIOD! And if you get lucky enough to get 2 points ahead it won`t` trade with you at all, plus the rolls become even more unbalanced in favor of the computer. Avoid this game.', 'Totally unbalanced, you can never win even on easiest mode. The dice will ALWAYS favor AI, you will always get screwed even if you are loaded up with the best numbers (6 or 8) AI will win with back to back harder numbers (12 or 2). I bought the game yesterday, have been playing for MANY HOURS, me against 2 AI players, they ALWAYS WIN! I give up. Uninstalling!', ""The game needs improvements. The AI cheating constantly in single player mode. The free version of the game it's easier to play for beginners especially. The free version is better than this one."", 'Every time I have to move the robber, I am unable to make another play/continue with the game. The screen isn\'t frozen, it just stays on the robber without letting me or the ""robots"" I\'m playing against, continue', 'I enjoy the game very much but since buying the expansions my popup menus (resources, progress cards, etc) randomly are blank. I have to close the game and open again to get them to appear again. Also, I hate that I have to read and agree to your privacy policies almost every time I start the app, which means I have enter my name and opponents all over again. Fix those issues and I will definitely update to 5 stars!', 'Purchased this game only recently and can not confirm my log in to play online...it tells me my registration is still pending and to check my inbox but I never received an e- mail... please fix because I want to keep on or better said start playing ...was also looking to buy the expansions ...', 'Updated: The online version doesn\'t work. I paid for this app, but even if you\'re able to register, the online version wont start. Disapointing Second problem has to do with the game fairness. I played over 200 games at ""Hard"" level and it\'s very difficult to win. Not because the robots are ""smart"", but because the dices distribution changes. the probability of getting a 2 on each dice is around 3%. the probablility of gettting three consecutive 2 is 0.01%. However, you\'ll see that happening a lot if you play against the computer. Suddenly you\'re leading by 5 points and the dices roll are highly biased towards the computer and then you finally loose. The developpers of this game clearly took a shortcut to make this level ""hard"", which brings out the fun of the game. Conclusion: Very fun game in real, but the app has serious flaws that makes it not enjoyable.', ""Software was written by evil people. Random Number Generator is a joke, some numbers that aren't yours will repeat at up to 8 times in a row. Frustrating to say the least ....."", ""Love the game but most times play single player. My only complaint is the unusual dice results and game actions. Once the human leads, the game seems to change, suddenly the normal mathematical probability of the dice shifts to favor the game, the robber will constantly find it's way to the human's tiles and the number seven just keeps coming. It feels like it's a calculated intent to even the game or change the advantage to the computer. Enjoy playing but often frustrates like crazy."", ""Great looking design and function but absolutely terrible AI. It's basically 3 vs 1 every game and with no difficulty settings it really makes the game unbearable to play"", ""Assuming you're even able to connect to their servers, you'll find that this classic and iconic board game has been made into a horribly buggy app. More frustrating than fun. There are better ways to waste your time."", ""I love this app. My mother-in-law is in the hospital in isolation. I would like to play Settlers of Catan with her to keep her occupied and engaged. I have been playing Catan Classic for the last couple years but now I cannot login to play online. I don't get a reset password email when I click the button. My mother-in-law cannot create an online account. She uses an iPad and hospital WiFi. Are your online servers having issues? Any help would be appreciated."", ""Has been freezing or going to a gray screen recently despite recent update. Wont get past initial screen. Disappointing since I've paid for some expansions and enjoy playing on the chromebook."", 'Locks up on launch with just a gray screen. The ""level"" of the AI really just affects how bad the cheating is with the dice. Lots of other little bugs. Often hides the other players paper level so you don\'t know whether you\'re going to be rewarded for a 5th level or not. Not as buggy as it used to be other than the really annoying grey screen that takes about 20 launch and kill cycles to get past. Waiting forever with a grey screen at launch doesn\'t help.', ""Tried to register for online play but never received a verification email to confirm my account and therefore was unable to play with friends (waited 20 minutes and decided to refund). Update to response: USM, I'm not an idiot. I checked my spam folder and even created another email address to register a second time. My wife also downloaded the game and had the same problem. When I pay for an App I expect it to work. You should fix the system instead of expecting people to contact you."", 'This is a fun game with real people but in the app, the knight randomizer is set up to be placed on your spaces EVERY time. Makes game not fun and is set up for you to lose.', ""Best value I've ever gotten from an app purchase. I've played this virtually every day for over a year. Easy background for your lunch. Pause it anytime and pick it up whenever. Truly 5 stars."", 'I cant even log in to play online, I couldnt register. I made 2 accounts and its telling me it I have the wrong password when Samsung saved the password for it. I didnt end up playing the purchase. Massive con scam', ""So one sided - not even enjoyable. Fix the AI, it's just pathetic how tilted the statistics are no matter the dice mode. I literally saw my opponent with 21 resource cards, with the rubber stuck on my number for 15 rounds, and not a 7 to be even seen! FFS just make the game realistic! You've butchered it far enough..."", 'The game is fixed and the die rolls are pretty jazzed up. Not worth the purchase.', ""Please add more levels to the campaign.. 16 or 23 isn't enough. Other than that, great game."", ""There's a glitch in the new update. You can't move the robber or sometimes you can only place the robber on specific tiles."", 'playing with AI dumb bc the 7dice roll comes out so much especially when u have 8 cards not even random at all and AI can have bad numbers but alway come out, this need fixes please lol', ""The app seems to be broken, it constantly asks you to trade even when you've declined. When you press X to not place a road, it places it anyway and there is no undo button to fix the issue. The robber appears the second you have more than 7 cards, every single time No where near as fun as the real game"", ""At first wouldn't open the app, crashed everytime I tried to open it. Reinstalled it and it then opened but never got a verification email to register. Very disappointed."", 'I love Catan. I wish the online rankings was better, but still a classic and you can play with your friends', 'UPDATE SEP 2019 : The app has frozen twice recently on the AI second players turn when I am on 12 VP as 4th player. Very frustrating! PREVIOUS REVIEW: the previous comment was very helpful - tap around on the screen until you find the invisible confirm buttons!', 'I downloaded this game to play with my family online but it keeps saying login in or register...so when I try to register it will not let me...I just need some help in figuring out how to connect online']"

- Update feature list on Upgrade screen","[""I've been on and off with this app, and despite the new update being a huge improvement in design, it also has a sort of drawback. Before you could take the lessons, one a day without premium, and return the next day to learn the next lesson. Now you are only able to see the first lessons of a given section and that's it. Quite frankly, I find it disheartening because it forces you to pay, rather than to wait. Sure, it's a small price, but some people are broke."", ""Absolutely hate everything about the new look. The new analysis mode is awful and harder to navigate. The main page now displays a 2 x X grid of your games with seemingly no way to change, preferred the list view. And the new design for picking your themes doesn't give you the name of what style your picking, and only shows the pawns and knight of the respective colours instead of all of them. How am I supposed to judge a set to see if I like it by seeing the 2 plainest pieces?"", ""The best app for learning, and playing, chess. My main complaint is that there is no option (that I can find) to turn off sounds. Also, the notifications seem use the media volume on your phone, not the notification volume. This means that this app's notifications will still make noise even if your phone is silenced."", ""It was an amazing app before the latest update, some of the functions are completely gone now( can't figure out how to redo a tactics lesson, there are no explanations why your move was bad anymore, analysis is not nearly as good as it has been). Wondering if there is a plan to implement it all back soon? Otherwise i see no reason paying for premium as it has become almost completely useless"", ""This new app is consuming more internet. If your internet is slow, then every move consider by this new app later, which means you will lose 2-3 sec, Almost every move. It's was fine with older app, but now I started losing more matches due to aforementioned issue. Please make your app for lighter, and effective in little bit slow internet, like previous one. I am using 4G, and my internet speed is really good. But, I am sure this new update has some issues."", 'When a game ends the pop-up ad covers the screen making it impossible to see information like how it was won ( by checkmate, timeout etc) or remaining time. There is no way of closing the pop-up. Apart from that it is excellent, although larger elapsed time display and configurable time warning alarms would be a great improvement.', ""Went from great to awful. I understand why you changed the mechanics to prevent instant moves, but that has caused some issues. But more importantly, it's now harder to move. Literally. The controls don't let me move where I want and I've often wasted 5+ seconds trying to make my move (I play 1min lightning rounds, 5 seconds is a lot.) so I will be looking for a new app."", 'This used to be a great experience but the two recent changes have turned that into a not so good experiences. The chess boards keep getting smaller and there been a lot of spaces added to the right, which is a total waste. Today the update as made the chess boards very small and added the options to the bottom of the screen. This makes it very distracting. The forward and backward buttons are now in an awkward place and too far apart, which causes them strain, especiallyif you play for long per', ""Ever since the new update the game is buggy: -points are not awarded if it is the last rating puzzle of the day (free version) but points are still deducted. -the survival rush puzzles sometimes do not allow you to move your pieces. When you close and restart, it does not let you resume your progress. Quality of life: -It'll be better to show how many puzzles you can attempt on the free version as currently it is not shown and it is inconsistent how many you get a day (had any from 0-3)"", 'Why did you guys switch up the format? Whats the point? Everything was fine as it was and now you take away the daily tactics puzzles that I enjoyed most about the old format and on top of that my tactics ratings which was at 2300 has completly disappeared! I dont think thats fair, bc not just me but others have been working for years to build their tactical ratings on here. If aint broke dont fix it! And bring back the old format, Period.', ""This was an exceptional experience, beautiful. The friends system works very well, easy to add and find my friends. Easy to challenge them, very good layout, easy to comment, very little storage space, or data required and would recommend this game to anyone. Edit: Can't access clubs at all. Very disappointing, have to access it on a computer and it kind of bothers me."", ""This was a great app to analyze your games through the custom game mode. You could set up the pieces and it could recommed moves, show where you made a mistake or blunder. You could also use the 2500elo bot to show you the best moves; however, they took all this out to promote premium subscription, which is unfortunate. If the analysis mode from premium is the same or better, it is one of the best out there, but I don't play chess seriously enough to pay for the best analysis over a free one."", 'Slightly unintuitive update. I realise that the app needed modernising with a sleeker finish but I\'m now a little lost. No doubt, I\'ll get used to it. However, I seem to have lost all of my lesson progress. Similarly, tactics seems to have been replaced by ""puzzles""? There are different modes and I actually enjoyed the challenge of the old tactics points system. Shame that has been lost too. Also, notifications seemed to have stopped working, which is frustrating for both me and my opponents!', ""App was great before the update. Lots of lost functionality for non paying users, like the explorer feature, and puzzles and tactics. Before you had a daily limit of 6 to 10 puzzles, now I can't even do one without being prompted to pay for the membership. It's a decent way to play chess with people around the world, but the lost functionality means I just won't use the app as much."", 'What happened to the Lesson I was in the middle if learning (pawn storm). I understand the need to update apps, etc, but this is such a drastic change from the previous version that makes it very difficult to navigate. And I just did Gold this year and I was only able to do 5 lessons per day, but with this change, it seems like I can only do one.', ""Their staff are very respectful. I really appreciate how they reply to my questions quickly and helpfully. Some things that the update changed that I don't like is that for some reason, the in game chat, even with friends, is disabled. Also, starting a game seems awkward and a little over complicated, or at least on mobile. Everything else is great though. It exceeds by far any other online board I have ever seen."", ""Shocking update. Did nobody test the playability of the game before release? Why has the sensitivity and accuracy of moving pieces decreased? This is essential to playing online via touch screen. Who is the product owner? Because they need firing. They know nothing about chess. You'll lose loads of people because of this update."", ""Have to say I dislike intensely the new version. Was perfectly happy with the old version. Now, for some reason I'm only allowed to play as white!!! Also find new format a bit insulting. It now appears to be targeted towards children who are new to the game, where as the older version allowed you to plod on at your own level. Help pages are next to useless. Really can't see any improvement, quite the contrary."", 'Love the app, but I miss the old layout. I miss seeing the daily puzzle and daily tactics right in front when I would open the app in the morning. The new layout is more confusing and the ads are placed right in the middle of the screen instead of at the bottom. Would appreciate an option to use the old layout.', ""It's a great update but I'm facing some issues. Firstly, I lost track of my lessons. All the names of the lessons have changed. Plus I'm not sure what happened, but we can only learn around 13 lessons and that's it. If you haven't subscribed then you're not going to learn much. Please exchange the lessons system back to the original format of doing one a day."", ""I used to love this app before the update, now the lessons are only available to premium members, and the ones thrt are free are very poor in quality when compared to the old version. I could also play several challenges before being prompted to subscribe, now I played 1 game and it didn't let me finish the second. I will not even bother with checking the other features, I'll just install and change to Lichess..."", ""Was a great app until recent changes make game play exceptionally difficult. Every move highlights squares needlessly, can't tell what's happening in the game. There are a crazy amount of notifications! At the end of the game they make you do a game analysis now and review mistakes. I don't want a game analysis. Just really clunky now. Looking at other options."", ""Garbage bot detection. Completly pointless playing online. Opponents will have terrible opening and middlegame knowledge, once you destroy them they magically become endgame masters and make winning moves. This app is terrible for online play. I'm constantly going up against cheats. I destroy the player in the opening and middlegame and magically they become world champs and make winning moves over and over again. I have been up a queen and two rooks and the cheater makes winning moves. Lame ap"", ""Latest updates screwed the whole app up. Can't change my theme, no abort option so once you click into a game you are forced to play as the timer ticks down straight away, usernames do now show up in full, new layout is terrible, I could go on and on. Wish I didn't update the app."", ""Recently got gold member, after the update I cannot access lessons starting from 'think like a chess player' section. Aside form the first lesson. Edit, their support told me this is by design, what a waste of money from my end, felt like an idiot getting the membership for a year when it's not even a month before they changed their membership content."", 'Awww what happened to older version it was so cool and easy to use interface..I play on mobile stupid ads appear all the time. this is worst update I have ever come across. I thought update makes things better but this turned out to be worst. What happened to the lessons. They all disappeared making it very hard to play. Please do something and bring back the older version.', 'I\'m very disappointed with the new update. Please revert the change or at least for it out as a ""chess classic"". It\'s not that I don\'t like change, it\'s removing functionality without any reason that is upsetting. I normally play against the computer and I\'m trying to improve my game. So in case of a stupid mistake I don\'t want to resign and start over. I want to take back my move. It\'s a computer I\'m playing, not a tournament.And why did the computer level go from 1-10 to 1-20? Popular request?', 'After the last update the format changed and now feels like it is formatted for a desk top computer not a phone. Now the thing that made this app better than the LiChess app is gone. If im going to have to use a clunky feeling chess app no matter what i might as well use Lichess now. Still a 4 star app but no longer the best chess app.', ""I pay diamond for this and I've loved it until this new update. Now it's very unclear how things work. I used to be able to create custom setups so the computer can play from a position I want to see if there's a refutation I can't find but now that feature seems to be gone. Analysis still exists in the tactics trainer but it seems buggy since choosing moves I got wrong won't always show how the computer would respond. Unfortunate as this used to be a fantastic app."", ""The new version is a huge step backwards, as the rest of the reviews are showing. The design and UI in particular is terrible (Why is there an enormous, orange new game button at the top of the home screen? Why is the header bigger than that button? Why is the logo always there?) Everything is giant icons, tiny type, and too much padding - it looks like a bad stock UI template. Notifications are still buggy as ever, so make sure to check your app for any moves you haven't been told about."", ""Was great before the last update, I thought the idea of updating somethin is to make it better than it previously was, I'm just really disappointed, I used to be on it all the time I love playing chess but now after the last update I'm slowly playing less and less, its just a really really really bad update, and please please please bring back the older version"", ""Used to be good, after the update I can't access any of the features though, like the puzzles. Can only play online, which is still great, but I really wish I could play the new rush mode and etc. Keeps saying 'Invalid login token supplies' tried going to 'help' and 'options'. Still doesn't work"", ""I don't usually write reviews and this is my first review ever, in every sphere throughout the internet. I quite don't underatand why there is no chess mentor part anymore. It was awesome. The new part is totally childlish. On the other hand, I like the new interface and the analysis part."", ""The upgrade has a few new features that are nice, but all that pales in comparison to the new game analysis whci is pretty awful IMHO. Previously I could look at a mistake or blunder, see what was better and often have a few further moves that would help me see the logic. But now I'm just told that a move is a blunder and here is what would be best. No further help at all. I was learning a lot, but now it's just too hard to figure out."", 'This was a 5 star app when I first downloaded it like 4 years ago, but this new update made me come here and officially give it a rating. This new update is phenomenal. Everything looks sleek and runs smoother than before. I am also glad that puzzle rush is now on mobile! Something I have been waiting for. Hands down best chess app out there', ""I'm just playing against computer using this app and game analysis feature was my favorite because I could saw my mistakes and learned from them. But the last update broke the feature. I could only see SERVER ERROR notification and no analysis shows up in both challage and learning mode. Play against computer is useless now."", ""The new update is awful. It's nowhere near as playable. Oh and now there are ads of scantily clad women and apps for dating..my children play this! Whoever is running that design team needs to be fired because they will lose all the parents who play this for starters. Let alone all the regulars who loved the old interface. There are so many issues I'm not even going to list them. If the design team can't even see kids might be affected by dating agency adverts why should I bother writing in"", 'New UI is crowded, several changes reduce the usability. The animation of pieces is unnecessary, distracting. The square-colour indicating the last played move is too similar to theme colour. The colour change in the timers as moves change is also distracting. Another irritating change is the squares-you-can-move-to being shown when the piece is dragged, rather than when it is touched. Illegal moves used to have a helpful spring back animation which was removed. Please revert these changes!', 'Went from playing as a 1600 player with a fair element of difficulty before the ""upgrade"" to now playing as a 1700 player in which I win 9/10 games. The speed of the game is better but that\'s about it. Bring back the old version. ""If it ain\'t broke, don\'t fix it"".', 'The new user interface in the last update is terrible. Right from starting a game to the actual live chess moves as well as premoves, the earlier interface was a thousand times better. The only improvement I felt was the analysis but for the rest please revert to the previous version.']"
Checkers,pl.lukok.draughts,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.lukok.draughts&hl=en&gl=us,"Dear Player,

<h2><b>Do you remember this board game from your childhood?</b></h2>
Checkers - traditional and inspiring game gives you a lot of fun with challenging computer or playing with other person on mode 2 players offline. Relax with yor family or friends and play Checkers. Share the game with children and show them the best entertainment from your schoolyears. 

Are you a board-game-enthusiast? Would you like to create or think over a strategy to win? Checkers will help you to learn and practice logical thinking. You can change settings and choose your own rules i.e. to capture backwards or to choose mandatory capture.

And what's more, you can get this app and play for free.

Checkers is the classic board game but in this app you can find features which make the game even more exciting. 

<h2><b>Different levels of difficulty</b></h2>
Let's start from the easiest level and check if you can defeat the computer. The more experienced you are, the more likely to win with the expert. Take up the challenge and go through all 4 levels!

<h2><b>Different rules</b></h2>
There is no one and only way to play Checkers. Everyone has various habits and usually prefers to play exactly the same way as in the past, that is why decide on your favourite rules:

<h2><b>American Checkers (English Draughts) 🇺🇸 </b></h2> Capturing is mandatory but the pieces cannot capture backwards. The Queen doesn't have long moves but only one step. The queen has ability to move and capture backwards.

<h2><b>International Checkers 🌍</b></h2> Capturing is mandatory and all the pieces can capture backwards. Also the queen moves differently, it has long moves – it means that the queen can move any distance diagonally if the square is not blocked.

<h2><b>Spanish Checkers (Damas) 🇪🇸</b></h2> These rules are based on the international but the piece cannot capture backwards;

<h2><b>Turkish Checkers (Dama) 🇹🇷</b></h2> Dark as well as light squares of the board are used. Pieces start on the second and third rows, do not move diagonally but forward and sideways. The way that queens move are similar to the chess queen.

Have you found the best rules for you? If not, choose your own rules. It's really easy, just enter Settings (upper right corner) and choose the options that you prefer.

<b>Do you want to help us improve Checkers?</b>
We would be grateful if you fill out a short questionnaire (3 questions). This will let us know what new features do you need.

Will definitely have to keep this as a mental recharge a bit, even though I don't play online games or most games at all."", 'Though this is a basic game that most all can understand from a young age, I may not always agree with the computer when it tells/forces you to jump, up through the med. Level, a person can/ should be able to win 100% of the games and also shows jumps you may not have seen or would have bypassed', ""Great game would recommend this. It's hilarious how many of the negative reviews are complaining about a rule in actual draughts and also it's a setting you can change in the game as well. Funny reviews and great game. 5/5"", ""Don't recommend. The game chooses the moves for you and not even as a 'hint'. It must have some algorithm where you can only move the pieces the game wants you to, so more than 50% of the time there's no actual game to play, just click where it wants you to. I am uninstalling."", ""Hate it, it's almost like you get no choice of where to go, and if you can get a counter you have to get it, you are not allowed to move a different counter so you end up losin half your counters and even the 'expert' is easy to defeat"", ""It's really nice I just dont like that they choose ur moves cause sometimes I get checked because I could move that piece and I wish they had more game choices than just the same 4 people but over all good game....AND there aren't like ever any ads maybe 1 or 2 but almost none!!!"", ""Super fun, like how its just classic checkers, do wish that u could move ur own way in a jump like if u didn't want to jump them it wouldn't make u!

Great for beginners! Once you tap a piece, it highlights all the possible moves. Also you can go back move by move to see where it all went south. Great for above average players. The only thing I dislike is on occasion, a game will be ""corrupted"" making continuing the game impossible. Overall, great app', ""It's technically a 5-star game in that it offers extensive gameplay to be held at once and vast diversification of adversaries to compete with. Honestly, great game. Just think there is too many ads, but I guess that's part of the app and every once in a while a game will become corrupt. Other than that I'd give it 4 1/2 stars if it were an option."", ""Rubbish support form Zynga. Known issues with games constantly 'out of sync' (?). after 2 years they still havent even attempted a fix. Really, really broken app that should be removed from the store as it only exists to trap people into paying for ad-free version. The moment you do, it stops working. Shameful Zynga, shameful."", ""As of right now I've experienced 2 corrupted games in a row after spending hours on developing the chess board. What a waste of time. I'm very dissatisfied and disappointed in the game and developers. Before releasing an app the developers should ensure its fully functional instead of doing a half arsed job. Secondly, when using Facebook login, I'm unable to change my account settings, such as username, email, password, and location. My country is stuck on Afghanistan as being first in the list."", ""I can't believe such a big game designer like Zynga has yet to figure out a way, or attempt to fix the obvious flaws in this app. The board is awesome, the access to friends is awesome. Yet you cannot get half way through a game without it corrupting and unable to continue. Truly sad and frustrating trying to play and never being able to see a game through to the finish. Major disappointment, zero stars, do not bother with this app."", ""This app sucks. It's clear after playing for six months that they put out an app to collect ad revenue. The interface is visually clunky, slow and bug ridden. There have been no noticeable fixes since I started playing. Lichess has no ads and no corrupted games due to whatever 'out of sync' means. The only thing good about this app is that yes, you can play chess, until your game is out of sync."", ""This app is annoying. The amount of corrupted games is ridiculous. The Facebook login link is flawed because it doesn't save my settings correctly. I am from the US yet every time I try to update that it keeps saying I'm from Afghanistan. This app is very flawed and I wouldn't waste time with it. There are plenty other far superior chess apps to use."", ""Nice interface although corrupt games have been a feature for far too long. Edit: paid for no ads, they really should have made this a subscription model so they can justify spending dev time to fix bugs and server costs. Half the games get corrupted, feels like they're just winding the product down."", 'I wish I could give negative stars for this crappy app. It is fruatrating to play this game for days with an opponent just to get ""Corrupted Games"", I have lost out on multiple wins with that. The site says they are working on it but its been a year with no change, so who is really working on it? Don\'t waste your time if you really love chess.', ""Games will consistently corrupt while in the middle of the game with cross platform players. The Ads are a little much. I get it.

But the ones that come to mind: the game I'm playing against someone not loading up when I touch to open it. I have to touch it several times or close the app and reopen it. And even sometimes that doesn't work. Until it eventually does. Another problem is corrupted games. You guys really need to address this. It sucks. And that makes your app suck. And those ads. OMG! Stop with the ads! No way is this app worth $10."", 'Great platform in Android (way better than the iPhone). I haven\'t found a more enjoyable app for chess.

I\'m currently searching for a new platform.', 'Love playing chess with all these people, but then halfway through a great game, the game gets ""corrupt"" and you\'re waiting for the other person to make their move forever!

Started again maybe a month ago. Slow and unresponsive interface. Seems like I can't get to current games until the 'play against someone new' carousel loads. Frankly, I'd like to just turn that carousel off altogether."", ""Love this app, meeting people from all over the world.The only problem I have with this game app is when your getting into a really good game some time it jumps off sync and becomes a corrupt game and it's hard to delete the corrupt game off of your current game list...."", ""The user interface is very unresponsive when trying to switch games. I have to press the button, to move to a new game, repeatedly. Sometimes I have to close and reopen the app to make my next move. Very glitchy. And it keeps corrupting games so i can't finish a match. This is a really terrible app."", 'Very fustrating experience with this game. Out of 70 games played approx 14 of them have ended with the same ""game is corrupted and unable to continue fairly"" error. A truly infuriating glitch to keep running across, especially since it seems to happen predominantly later in the game, after time has been invested.', ""It's extremely buggy and laggy, I can't even click on the active matches 80% of the time and have to keep restarting the app to get into the games. Also, I've had games become corrupted and unplayable for no reason. Fox the issues if you want more people to play."", 'Constant \'currupt\' or \'game is out of sync\' games and will not update quickly/efficiently. ie: opponent makes a play and app will not update so that you can then make a play (it will still say ""their move""). 28 minutes later, it will allow me to finally make a play. Super annoying.', ""The app consistently lags, then crashes, requiring restart. One game was reported as corrupt and prematurely ended. Will be uninstalling (even though I've paid for an ad-free version) as soon as current games are finished. For as long as Zynga's been around, I expected a better app."", ""Too many ads. Could have been good but the same ad after every move gets really annoying. After a complete game would have been enough. What's also annoying, is the ads come straight after your move so you don't get chance to re-examine the board. Even worse games get corrupted for no reason at all."", ""Have played a lot of games with my dad and it's been an awesome app but every update to my phone and it crashes, and occasionally the games have an error and become corrupt and it's super frustrating especially if you're 80+ moves in. But still not a bad app needs a little sanding around the edges though"", ""Great app when it works... Too many glitches though. Need to sort out the major sync issues (Games get corrupted all too often), and unable to delete old games. After deleting historical games, they reappear again as soon as I re-open the app. Rating would be higher if it wasn't for these issues."", ""I like for the most part. It's really frustrating the rate that games get corrupted. I wouldn't mind if it were the free version, but for a paid version it seems like that shouldn't happen"", ""Still cannot do anything about the corrupt games try reinstalling the app still doesn't help you also need to address the problem of not being able to block players. I'm getting way too many players trying to sell me a scam 💰"", 'Corrupted/out of sync flaw is horrendous. Wish I could get my $ back to stop the ads, I thought it would help keep a game going. Not recommended at all. Really disappointing.', 'Absolutely terrible app - I have tried to play about 5 different chess matches on the app, however every match ends up ""Corrupted - Unable to continue"" before you can finish. Find another one this app is awful and barely works.', ""Just starting out with just with friends but it's been so far so good. I think after I play a few more games if I still like it I'll go to the premium edition with no ads. Well here it is six months later and I do love the game for just a few cents it brings immeasurable happiness I have spent the few dollars to eliminate the commercials parentheses ads and have never been sorry try it with the ads for free and if you like it like I did pay the $9 and eliminate the ads"", 'App is great, except for the major issue of roughly 40% of games becoming corrupted and unplayable before finishing them. Devs have known about the issue for yeats now, and done nothing to fix it.', 'Great app to play chess. An ad after every single move though. You can remove the ads for $9.99? Its a ridiculous price for an app that just performs basic functions.', ""It's a lot of fun. Convenient. They've fixed all the issues as far as I can tell. My review used to be one star but they've really done a great job getting it so games don't crash."", ""This game would be great if the games wouldn't get out of sync so frequently. It's super annoying. What makes it worse is that they never go away. I currently have 1 active game and 15 games out of sync. New updates still doesn't address the issue."", 'Ads after every move. Crashes every time I try to invite facebook friends to play. Will not let me change any account info whatsoever. And they have the audacity to try to charge $10 for no ads on a game that keeps crashing.', 'The game is good, plenty of opponents, the adds are unbearable. I will give this a few more goes and then delete the app. Thats why I got rid of it last time.', ""Shockingly bad. App is slow as hell, and often won't open the game when I press on it. Takes 5 minutes sometimes. Plus like others my games are constantly going corrupted. Is a shame cuz I know this app was good years ago. What have you done!?"", ""I was mid game and clearly winning when my opponent offered a draw and without even opening the app the draw was accepted. Incredibly frustrating to have a game that's been going on for days end without me doing anything. And no there was no repetition"", ""Would be five stars if games didn't constantly corrupt, lag, can't change username or account information, expired games have to be removed by sending in complaints. The game it's self is fun and Zynga replies quickly when you reach out, just needs all the bugs fixed."", 'Terrible. Disappointing. Doesn\'t work. Paid $13 and haven\'t been able to finish a single game. ""Game is corrupted"" would love my money back. Downloaded a free game and works perfectly. What a waste of money.', 'I absolutely love this app. Best chess app out there. The only reason it gets 4 stars instead of 5 is because every now and then I\'ll have a chess match get ""corrupted"".

You can enjoy real-time online Chess all over the world.
Chess is a two-player strategy board game played on a chessboard, a checkered gameboard with 64 squares arranged in an eight-by-eight grid. It is one of the world's most popular games, played by millions of people worldwide in homes, parks, clubs, online, by correspondence, and in tournaments.

Each player begins the game with 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns. Each of the six piece types moves differently. Pieces are used to attack and capture the opponent's pieces, with the objective to 'checkmate' the opponent's king by placing it under an inescapable threat of capture. In addition to checkmate, the game can be won by the voluntary resignation of the opponent, which typically occurs when too much material is lost, or if checkmate appears unavoidable.

Checkers (AKA Draughts) is one of the world's most popular board games.  The earliest records of this game date back to the Egyptians 3500 years ago. In more recent times this has been most favoured by the USA and Scotland, the two countries to provide the most World champions in this game. In England and Scotland this classic board game is known as English Draughts. This implementation has been designed to provide a strong engine, even if only running on a mobile phone.

My opponent was sitting right next to me but my moves wouldn't show up on his phone. (Update) Thanks to the fast reply from the developer, we fixed the problem. I still really like the game, but after playing many rounds, I think the developer could refine the difficulty levels a bit. There seems to be a huge jump in difficulty from level 2 to level 3.

There are not too many ads on this app, and the ones that are there are actually useful. They are sensible ads that pertain to things I\'m interested in. Thank you.', ""Online players take forever to move won't install the game until it is working"", ""Sneaky. It seemed fine at first. No unnecessary permissions. After I installed it however, it kept asking for permissions to media files and storage, but most worryingly it stated that advertising would be stored outside of the app. This is disgusting. I'm surprised Google allowed this. Uninstalling ASAP!"", 'Easy to play, nothing complex to figure out.
