Klondike Solitaire classic is called sometimes by the generic name 'Solitaire', for example a famous Solitaire is actually Klondike Solitaire. This is probably the most popular solitaire games in the world.

Klondike solitaire classic uses one deck (52 cards). Twenty-eight cards are dealt from the deck into the 7 tableau piles with the number of cards per pile increasing from one to seven from left to right. The top card is face up, the rest face down. 
The opening table has: 
7 tableau stacks, 
4 foundation piles, 
stock and waste pile. 
The object of the game is to use all the cards in the deck to build the foundations up in suits from Ace, 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,Jack, Queen, King.

Here is a brief description of what solitaire means.
Solitaire card games free or games of patience, as they used to be known, is the category of card games played with one or more card decks and which objective is to move all the cards from one determined display to one pile or piles. Playing solitaire has with out doubt its uses. For example playing a solitaire game will keep you company during sleepless nights. For an stressed or worried mind it can be of great ease to relax by playing one or two games of solitaire.

Solitaire games, also known as Patience in Britain, are Solitaire card games free for a single player. Does not exist a precise history of solitaires, but it is probable that solitaires are been born with the card games. The word solitaire is of french origin, and it means patience. The first book on the argument comes printed in 1870. It was Illustrated Card Games of Patience by lady Adelaide Cadogan, containing 25 card games, reprinted many times.
Nowadays, the most famous solitaire of them all is ""Klondike"", which takes its name due to the disposition of the cards on the tableau, which reminds the form of the ""Klondike"" mountain.",üèÖWorld‚Äòs #1 solitaire! üåüüåüüåüüåüüåü  The most addictive klondike solitaire Games.,"10,000,000+",10000000,4.689632,370491,130008,0.0,True,USD,True,Varies with device,Varies,Solitaire Card Games Ltd,Solitaire+Card+Games+Ltd,lemongameinc@gmail.com,,http://www.zhongbosoft.com/solitaire_policy.html,7402665836047794644,Card,GAME_CARD,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_VLEZEXO1wU5L4bqDTxGRZhy_CQVh0RvXJTPVBk-6_03hvbcqEWkyEEuCgzEU3aHXvM,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/qSdn4zz9F_JFFKtK-QzCncR4b9vhdQgYF5_itsyvOIOwuzRLva-ppho8NYq4bsb1sjU,Everyone,,True,True,"Aug 17, 2016",1582116541,Varies with device,"WHAT'S NEW

- Happy harvesting!","[""Obsessed! It's my favorite solitaire game to date. Something about the smooth, colorful design, creative game mechanics that force you to adapt your strategy from game to game, and daily challenges that are the perfect difficulty. I don't usually make in game purchases, but I've made several so I can keep playing this game. If I could change anything, it would be to lower how much the higher tier golden crop games cost, as it greatly reduces my game time if I lose a hand."", ""This is a very addictive, challenging, entertaining, and yet so frustrating, but it keeps me going back and wanting to complete the daily challenges! This app is a super way to have some me time, pass time while waiting, and just to relax at the end of the day! Kudos to the developer for making an app that is appropriate for all levels if play and to be able to keep a person coming back even after a very frustrating round! Most apps I would have uninstalled, but I'm determined to win!"", ""I would've given 5 stars as I truly enjoy the game. However, even though solitaire should be random with card draws, I believe this not to be the case here. I start to get low on coins, play a round, get down to 1 card to clear, 5+ in the deck, and 3 of them are the same # and lose the round. I'd be ok with losing the round if they were 'random' cards, but I feel as though it is set up hoping I'll buy more coins, which will not happen üòï"", ""I do enjoy playing this game however it does have issues. I get really annoyed when with the fact that unless you dish out real cash you can't win certain levels!! It is possible that you can rack up very large credit card by just paying the game aggressively. I will never understand the reason for halving to play large amounts of money per levels, just to complete that level... it makes absolutely no sense what so ever... It makes you feel complacent and you just end up going with the flo"", ""You barely get enough credits from winning a level to maintain a playing streak. You use a lot of credits for Wild cards or 5 more. Obviously they want you to pay and not just enjoy. I get it games aren't cheap. So I save lots of coins and play once a week or so or just when I'm bored on Toonblast. But...I do think thwy could give us just a little bit more cresits, come on guys gals."", ""Think it's ridiculous having to use 6,000 coins to draw an extra card! At times, there's no way to beat the level without replaying it multiple times and each time it cost 2,200 coins to play one round. I will never spend actual money to play a game so, I have to wait an hour to collect 2,500 coins to replay or continue playing."", 'This game is very addicting, however the only way to play more than one hand every few hours is to pay thru the nose!! Your best bet is to unistall then reinstall after a few hundred levels, at first they give you the cards to possibly win everyother game but after that they wait until your down to your very last coin to give you a probable winning hand. Game is def rigged & this coming from someone who spent a ridiculous amont of $ to get to master league. Time to just say enough...', 'The game is fun at first than it gets harder and more expensive coin wise to move up. Would never dream of paying one dime out of my hard earned money just for more coins. If all they want is your time, money and power then this game might as well be at a casino in Las Veges. SEE YOU LATER ALLIGATOR!!!!!', 'Starts off a good game but beware when you get to level 1500 as it corrupts your phone with a virus!!!. Only way to get rid of it is to erase your phones files completely and you lose everything.Also starts sending you spam emails to your gmail and email address so your personal information is obviously being stolen from some some 3rd party. DO NOT DOWNLOAD!', 'Ace, love the game. Update, been playing this for a while now and it is designed to frustrate you, youre wanting to complete the level and you have one card left and a deck of about 10 cards but still cant complete it. Even when you buy credits, which it heavily pushes you towards it still does the same.', ""I really wanted to enjoy this game. Yet, It's too costly. It gets more expensive by levels the longer you play. If you buy coins & extra insurance cards, that adds up money-wise pretty fast! If you use the special insurance cards, I would score better than if I didn't. Interesting tactic. The graphics are great & I had no bugs, etc. It's a bit draining running in the background & having to check in every hour for additional coins. I don't have the time to do that during a work day."", ""It's cool. I can't seem to earn enough money to keep up with the cost increase of the farm bc you have to beat the golden glades to earn the increase. The golden glades will take all of your money trying get those stupid combinations... 3 spades, 3 diamonds and 2 hearts. I spent like 70k trying to clear the first freakin row. Ugh. That's worse than in real real life!"", ""Homest to god this game is just a cash grab for old people or something. The game mechanic is that you need to use coins to win levels, and you're 98% not going to win a level. You'll spend all your coins just trying to get evem one star. I've been stuck on the same level for over a month now."", ""I am so disappointed. I made it to the big league game. Came in 2. After completing over 100 levels, with no spins or crates rewards. All that effort, time and money I put into it, didn't get any reward for coming in second place. I can't play a game that is so crushing with utter disappointment. Was my fav game. Just a money pit"", ""This game is very cute and fun, and the card rules themselves are easy to pick up and fun to play, but this game is extremely expensive. I can only play 2 or 3 rounds per day, because the cost of starting a new round is so high, and winning a round is so difficult. I'd like a game that I can actually play!"", ""It sometimes takes a while to build up credits once you get to higher levels but otherwise it is a fantastic game. It has a variety of different aspects that change up the game so it's not the same exact thing over and over again. Kills time while making me think, but not to hard after a long day."", ""I still stand my ground, love this game..first thing I do in the morning.. before I get out of bed.. is check the game and collect the credits..my name is Millie Rivera and I am addicted to this wonderful game hahahaha.. still enjoying the game. loved..loved..loved the tulips... Everytime I update still say the same...my favorite game, I read some comments and I laugh...some people don't have the patience. If the game was so easy it be boring...little challenge is good and developers are fair"", ""I really enjoy playing, as the solitaire boards keep changing, so it keeps challenging you. I don't, however enjoy having to spend money to keep up with the increasing costs within the game or losing time to either build up my bank or waiting for more levels."", ""I'm updating this to a one-star review. I've gotten to where I just hate this game. Forget everything money or the jackpot on the wheel on the rare occasions when you get to spin it. You only get to spend it like every 20 levels. I will admit I put real money into this game on rare occasions that I have it. I'm convinced the only way you will ever succeed in this game is to pay real money for the coins. And you do not get a gift everyday like it says you do."", 'As much as I enjoy playing..it seems this game is set up in a way that you will eventually have to make a purchase. Im on level 199 and to play is 2500 coins wilds are 7500 coins and 5 cards cost 5500 undo is 650 coins. Although I have increased in levels the payouts still dont even compare to what you have to spend just to complete some levels. You have to wait 24 hours for 5000 coins and and my harvest so far is only 2500 hourly. I like playing but surely will not be making any cash purchases', 'The only problem I have with this game is in the amount of the winning for completing a level. If it costs 3000 coins to play and I complete level and get 3200, what is the sense? Either it should cost less or you should win more or both! The balance is all off.', 'The game is addictive. Fun,challenging & frustrating as hell. I do not believe the cards are random, even though Admin says they are. Impossible w/how the cards land & games end. Complaints & issues do get response quick though. I love the game,but, hate the algorithms beating me!!! Level 679 & never won the big prize on the spin. Random? Impossible. Peace', 'Its fun and entertaining but sometime i have a thousnd card and one to remove and i lose due to the lack of number and this is irritating. Now i just won 3x dollars for the next 3 rounds and it gave me 2x. And levels cost tooo much and during harvast u win for only one game thing that normally is good but not everyone opens is every 1 houer to harvast and get dollars.', 'I love solitaire so this game makes it fun and more challenging. However i dont like how hard it gets as your continue. It makes it impossible to play. I have deleted it twice just to start over again. The enjoyment goes awsy the longer you play.', 'I like this game a lot. But once you get to higher levels it cost all your ""Harvest"" coins to play an unbeatable level. I\'m stuck on one one level for days sometimes, and I have spent a lot of actual money on this game (LOTS OF MONEY!!) I will only move forward if I do.When I\'m not spending actual money, I\'m not getting to the next round. I am currently on level 2851. I finished level 2850 and got a free 5 extra cards. I just went through the whole deck AND the 5 extra cards. STILL didn\'t win!', 'Love this game! Just wish the winnings and ""harvest"" amounts would also go up as the ""cost"" to play each round goes up and the cost of the 5 extra cards and wild cards go up. Other than that, I absolutely LOVE this game!!!', 'Really good solitaire game, but the hour it takes to collect coins is way too long, and the ""price"" for each round goes up and up and you\'re rarely able to gain coins. The price to buy coins is very high and never goes on sale.', ""Worst game I've ever played and I'm letting everyone know not to install this money hungry application. all of the actions in game cost a ridiculously amount of coin and the game also forces you to spend a ridiculously amount of coin for the game to slightly move forward. The game gives you six to seven cards to finish a 40 card game? Disgusting. Smh"", ""I am addicted to this game! It is so much fun üëè I also wanted to add, the graphics are amazing, it's very impressive. and the music is so much better than all the other games that play stupid music that sounds like it's written for a cartoons. I absolutely love the dog!"", ""Great game, challenging hands, great bonuses. Only thing I don't like is when you use your wild cards in the puzzle, you have to use them as soon as it's uncovered instead of when you would like to. It wastes the wild card when you are playing a run & it's uncovered in the middle of the run."", 'I am removing it after buying power ups that did not help my score. Like candy crush it is a game that is designed to get you to pay for power ups so your chance of advancing are not based on chance but manipulations. Played it for three weeks.', ""This is a fun game. Addicting. I don't like the fact it takes soooo many credits for stuff which makes me quit because I'm not spending money to play more games! I'm not going broke to get what I want!! So I quit and play other games."", ""Well,should be able to play, more than 5 seconds after harvesting, or more credits instead so a person has a bit of a chance to play it's very frustrating to wait for harvesting every hour, and not go anywhere on the game, thanks"", ""My original rating was 5 stars but I have reduced to 3 stars, and reducing again to 1 star. I LOVE this game but they need to make some major changes. It is great at first but the higher you get the harder they make it to win levels. You lose all your coins trying to beat levels because they want you to spend money. I refuse to spend money. They also need to make the harvest automatic every hour for those of us who can't have their phone at work and can't harvest every hour."", ""Fun for the first 30 minutes. After that you fail each level 75% of the time if not more. You have to log in and collect currency every hour or it doesn't keep building. Currency collected lets you try about 3 times to pass the next level. If you only have time to play for 5 minutes and you like losing repetitively this game is for you!"", ""Fun game, but it seems like everybody has the same criticism. You can only enjoy the game for a short time because every level costs 1000+ coins and you can blow through your whole amount on one level if you're having a hard time. I'm not gonna keep a game that I can only play a little bit."", ""Really disappointed, completed an event twice and haven't received the reward credits. Went through the help option and had an email saying they had put them on my account, yet still have not received the credits?? Had no reply from the email I sent back. What is the point in running events if you don't honour the reward?"", ""Absolutely love this game. Now that I've played it for quite awhile, there are some things that I find I don't like. I don't like the Masters league missions. It requires getting too many stars. It's impossible. Especially when it takes over 10,000 credits to play just one game."", 'I love this game very addicting and fun and relaxing game I play everyday three or 4 times a day and I play at midnight also o get bonus points and then I play late at night also great game you get more than 5 stars you get a 10 keep up the great work I love all of the games grand harvest is the best I still give you a 10 stars love it', ""Don't bother! Each game costs too much more than you can win. So play 2 times and wait an hour to harvest enough credit to play again. When you have time to look, like at an airport.. play something that will pass the time. There are way better Solitaire games out there!""]"

A Trade in option for duplicate card for gems or coins would be nice. Also have the option to select how many gems you could use would be nice other then all of them or just 1 card pack.

Should have more rare and iconic cards for each character instead of triplicated of low end cards.', ""Love it! Very simple for beginners to pick up and have a great time! I'm currently in the middle of some data recovery due to a device screw up and the almost immediate response from the Konami team has brightened my day. The game is blast, the community is diverse, and no matter how my own situation resolves, I will continue to support the game and encourage others to play. Have fun everyone! Edit: You guys rock! I was quickly helped and am happy with where it stands. 10/10 service! Thank you!"", 'Amazing brings back the nostalgia while bringing a new hunger to keep duling.

Have fun its time to duel!!', ""I started to watch the anime and instantly fell in love with the game. The only thing I don't like is that you can only have 3 monsters and spells and traps so things like summoning Obelisk the Tormenter by sacrifycing three monsters and then sacrifycing 2 monsters to destroy all monsters isn't a thing but the game is still amazing but also lack attack animations exept for the little energy bursts. But this game is a good way to start your yugioh quest to victory. Get you game on!!!"", ""In my opinion, this game has it all, strategy, great visuals, and engaging gameplay. You can have a duel that's going perfectly for you and BOOM, the enemy played their cards just right and put you in quite a situation, and you can do the same thing if you're smart with how you play. Duels are always thrilling and keep your attention. The only gripe is that some of the bots are way too weak, but that's not how you're supposed to play the game."", 'Very fun nostalgic game. Very nice and always doing in game events to unlock more cards, characters, and items. Very generous with in game currency and what you would buy is very cheap, very good details. The online is smooth and pleasant. If you enjoy yugioh and want to play again or want to learn it this game is honestly one of the best ways to play. Getting used to the 3 monster slots and 3 spell/trap slots takes a bit of getting used to but does not hinder the experiences.', ""Lemon Magician Girl's effect (where it lets you special summon one spellcaster type monster from your hand) is not working. Please fix it asap."", ""Before I downloaded this, I hade no idea what Yu-Gi-Oh! was. I played this game for a little, and caught up to my friend's skills really fast. I've played the game and got all the way to platnium without spending a single penny. The game also has a lot of events giving you free rewards, so if you are a beginner, you can get good cards for free. The game is overall awsome!"", ""Its good if you don't want to deal with all the convoluted nonsense they added to the TCG in the last 10 years, but be prepared to grind for a couple months to build a competitive deck only for it to fall behind the meta as soon as you complete it and another couple of new decks come out, game is still fun but but you'll be at a disadvantage against the whales ."", ""It's a fun game but it's designed to be very addictive to open and buy packs. After the start you get very few gems, and there is not crafting system for cards. Everything also takes too long to do, it sucks your time like a vacuum. 20 card decks, 4000 LP, and small hands, limits creativity and shorten games (which is both good and bad)"", ""I literally play this all day. It's a great and fast paced upgrade to how the original tcg is played which makes it perfect for mobile. The only thing I have to complain about is the players with a lack of imagination when it comes to building decks. You'll face many opponents with the exact same strategies/ decks and after a while it kind of turns into a play to win type thing ( if you're serious about ranking up that is) but for people just playing to pass time it's perfect"", 'The game is challenging enough to have fun you could play with other players to see their skills. You could even play with your freinds. The only thing is that getting gems is hard but the rest is just awesome. I never played a better online card game that is this fun.', ""There's a lot to enjoy here and it's very fun. However, the ranked matches can be a nightmare with certain deck builds that essentially end you before you even have a chance to do anything. Still a great mobile game though, especially if you're a fan of the YuGiOh card game.""]"

Love the game but some of the things on the app you shoukdnt have to pay for. I pray there is a better update on that issue.', ""Fun game play. You don't win many coins or anything but it's easy to do and I like the fact that you can build your own building and decorate it to how you want it to look. Helps me to relax after a long day at work"", ""This is the best card game app I've played and I've played loads of them. The games themselves are good fun plus you get to gradually build a tower and fill it with characters and more from fairytales. I love it and cannot recommend it highly enough!!!"", 'Addicting game, so much so that I have run out of floors to add to the tower! Are you going to add more so that I can continue playing the game? Really enjoyed it!', ""Really great game I can't stop playing! The graphics are really good. The characters are cute, and I just love the whole idea. Thank you for making such a beautiful game!"", 'Super cute and fun to play, maybe a little bit repetitive (???) But still a reaaaally nice game', ""Game is cool, slower than might think, storeys need furniture etc. Cat is adorable, graphics are mostly awesome. The quotes are upsetting (characters in game say thing like coffee is bitter and people drink it because life is bitter etc). For personal reasons the spiral card animation uspets me, wish there was a way to not have those animations. I noticed that the game does have a timer and usually i can't play such games for long, but it hasn't surprisingly bothered me too much yet."", 'Played the game for a while built up the building but now the timer is stuck on 2:54:00... Now uninstalled disappointed', 'Great game but the ads are getting annoying with the interruptions.', ""The game force you to lose gold in later levels. I'm ok with bombs but sometimes they only show 2 cards and you have no choice but to go through all your cards to match and open up more cards. They also add ads to show up if you open menus. I don't recommend this game at this stage."", 'Lots of fun, easy to play, very interactive.', ""So fun. But freezes daily!! I pay my money to do cool things in the game and now this game won't play. Ugh. Tired of uninstalling and re-downloading."", ""Great little game you have here .....just love it ...thank you and keep up the fantastic work my friend .üòÜ...but I have found out the hard way that eventually if you don't pay you don't win ... bummer good bye ."", ""This is a delightful little game! Though there are in-game purchase options, I haven't felt like I've reached a bottleneck where they're required. Things move quickly and smoothly and the art is so cute!"", ""It's seems fun. I like the towerbuilding and collecting"", ""So far I really like this game. I like that you don't have to be connected to the internet to enjoy it. I also like the choices of characters and stuff. Very fun and I reccomend it to others. üòä"", ""This game was fun at first but the stupid bombs and birds suck big time. I can't finish a game without the bombs always going off and its messed up we have to pay 40000 coins just to get one turn per game üòë I'm gonna delete the game"", ""sometimes it crashes when I'm about to start a game and I lose all of my coins."", 'I like the game a lot but it is annoying when the start loading screen on the title page is taking forever to load...', 'Good graphics and very addicting!!!', 'I had a 4 floor tower that i was worling on for like 4 days, then the game completely restarted and i cant get any of my old save back.', ""Looks like a very good game but it won't start for me, I've waited 30 plus minutes for it to load but its stuck on the loading screen"", ""I like this game so much!

Fix it pls üò•üò•"", ""I like the game but for some reason I can't get past the loading screen"", ""Game was very enjoyable, but it's now impossible to continue playing. You'll eventually run out of gold, and you only have 2 ways to earn more. 1) watch an ad for a limited amount of gold (which will only allow 1 extra game) 2) buy gold with IRL money I wish I could continue playing the game because I really enjoy it, but I don't want to play 1 round an hour and don't want to pay for more gold."", 'Lots of fun, but will my data be restored when I replace my device?', ""It's beautiful game with minimal setting. I wished you give gifts to those who pre registered though. Looking forward the game, I already purchased the microtransactions like card skins. Edit: I found that the game Ad system doesnt work. It wont let me watch ad to increase my gold coins from achievements. I dont want to give bad rating just because of that since this game is very enjoyable so please look at the problem and fix it."", 'Great game for the first few floors and the art is great too. When ""bomb"" cards start to become a thing, this game went from a 5 to a 1. Instantly losing if you are unable to deal with it since the deck is random is infuriating, if you used too many cards to solve the bomb you are screwed anyway, which leads to the other major problem. Gold is way too hard to acquire, cannot comprehend why its used to play, and then barely make back the money after winning. Even ads cant keep you afloat.', 'I like that there is more to do than just plain solitaire it makes it where i wont get board', 'Game was fun until reaching the point where the bomb comes into play. The bomb makes a really obnoxious sound and forces you to throw any kind of planning out the door. Think the game developers forgot that one of the biggest pluses about solitaire games is pleasantly enjoying some game time. Not the hectic mess the irritating bomb turns the game into. Sadly game went from fun to uninstall.', ""This is my favorite game for the year! It's so cute!! The best thing is, the developer doesn't hound you for reviews and money, and that makes me want to support them more! EDIT: THERE ARE SO MANY MINOR BUGS. Time doesn't work properly (waiting for 16 hours instead of 8 hours for a character), princess and prince cards underneath each other, get log in bonus twice a day then none for the next 3 days. PLEASE FIX IT DEAR DEVELOPER EDIT: The lag is getting worse dear developer.. I'm on 6th floor."", 'Fairy tales of old are new again I was hoping for Klondike type solitaire but tripeaks is just fine. Complete a hand and get diamonds to help you create a new floor in your building of books come to life. Choose a tale and furnish that world on a floor, not completely unique but fun! Enjoy a new way to play cards, see you on the web.', 'The gameplay is fun and I enjoyed building the tower. But I have to give this game 2 stars overall because of the outrageous number of ads. Trying to play, or checking your tasks will pop up ads. Even going to watch an ad for coins will serve you up an ad before you get to the screen.', ""Money trap, straight up. Doing ANYTHING costs premium currency that takes forever to get. In fact, basic gold takes forever as you only get around 30 per solitaire game. The solitaire gameplay itself isn't that fun either. It's the basic pyramid gameplay (you can clear a card one higher or lower than your top pile card) and there are not enough cards in each setup to get decent combos going. Overall, it's slow because of the currency issues, and not very fun."", ""I love this game, solitaire with a twist! Great work development team. I can't wait to see what is in store for the future! Also I haven't had any issues with gold or anything I have 100k plus so IDK why so many complaints about gold even with bomb cards. It's easy and if you lose a level you can definitely complete it without needing to play it 50 times. I usually complete it on the next try!"", ""Honestly, really liked the game at start, it's a fun tower builder but the second time I get In the game(probably after a small update) every menu click, the play button, all gives me a 30sec ad on top of the optional one for extra rewards... 1-2min solitaire games and around 45sec of ads is what you get."", ""The game was fun and I was willing to overlook the pretty bad gold balancing because the art direction is great and the actual game was fun but when the bomb cards were introduced it just sucked all the enjoyment. Either you rush through your deck and miss other matches to defuse it and therefore lose since you can't match other cards or it explodes and you lose. At that point you use all your gold just trying to play and then have to watch an ad to get gold even to be able to play again :(""]"

I recently lost all my power plays/extras and have no way of having them returned, after having played this game for approximately three years. I do not Facebook or email when playing any of the other games I enjoy through Google and find that this is the only game asking me to do so in order to not have items lost.', 'It takes too long to get new levels. They introduce new aspects like the path to earn rewards but then give pointless, crappy rewards (free card for 15 minutes) on the ""free path"". In 20 levels, you get maybe 10 rewards. To get anything you can use, you have to use gold - which you ONLY get by buying.

The problem is how expensive the games are to play with the minimal coins you have . The games can be hard to win and consequently, WAY LESS COINS!', ""I am really enjoying this game. The graphics are great and the extra little quest was a good idea . They give you extra ways to earn coins. It's a great way to pass time when you find yourself waiting at Dr's office or any place that takes up your time. Thanks guys for giving us a fun game. Wish we could earn more coins like a 100,000 for daily logins. üòÅü§ë LOL !!! JUST KIDDING but really thanks"", ""I really like this game however lately it's been glitching. Throughout the past couple updates. Multiple times I have played and the game has not registered that it'd a new day. Yesterday I opened the app and didn't receive my daily bonuses. Today I opened it and the game took me back to day 1. This is at least the third time it has happened. A little frustrating."", 'The game was 5 stars until they changed the bonus board, then went down to a 5. One builds up coins to get extra benefits on the board. Then most of the extras were either removed or placed differently making it impossible to obtain extras. Mostly, the 2500 coins you bet only get you 500 coins back. You lose a great deal, forcing you to make purchases to get by. Uncontienable.', ""This game is the biggest con I have come across. It started well. Then it becomes a dishonest pattern I should know because I have a photographic memory. 5 day's ago I got to the NO1 on the Leaderboard. Last night (5day's later)I have been knocked down to No 6. So I played running out of coins I reached to 3 definetly maybe 2 but it would not let me see.Since last night I am listed NO 97 and on a list to be demolished. Yes it's only a bloody game. But so dishonest and fixed.Shall take my leav"", ""From one greedy lil game to the next. There is absolutely nothing special or unique about this game for me to want to continue to play. There is no reason it should cost 500 coins to play one round. Which is set up nicely to screw you out of earning there free money. My first real move should not come after I've flipped seven side cards first, especially at 500 a round. They start you off with an okay amount of free coins, but quickly take it right back with rigged set ups, and costly level fees"", ""They are destroying a community they helped build. It was great to see how they promoted team Building and charity support. That makes people want to do more for each other. I've even bought gift boxes for my teams. But now they are changing features that take away the desire to win. The most insulting part is that while they promote the community, they won't incorporate the membership feedback. What a great way to destroy what you have created. Save the canned response for someone else please"", ""Don't bother. The games are stacked so you can't win. When you spend over 150k coins to pass one level there is no way the odds are random. It used to be fun, challenging, and progressable. Now it's just a scam to take your money!!! Find a better game that truly has random odds/deals. One where the cards in the deck actually work with the cards to clear."", 'Solitare TriPeaks you have managed to take a game that was different from other games challenging really fun to play, into a joke. You changed the shrine to your advantage!! Robbing your dedicated players of precious coins earned coins!! Its hard enough to earn coins when it costs 3000 just to play one round having to buy more cards just to finish up the round even then it takes two sometimes three times of buying more cards spending up to 30,000 at times just to finish up the round {WHY????}', ""Terrible. You can play intelligently and never win. It's nothing less than frustrating. When you play at least, literally 15 - 20 games on the same board with zero success.... it's taking away from the fun. Especially, the further along you get. And now ads are being added constantly. So, if you want to pay to play and don't mind ads. Have fun. Uninstalling....."", ""Lots of recent changes, none good. Game randomly resets, so no idea when quests or daily bonuses will show up or when they need to be claimed. Prizes have decreased in value. If you haven't started playing, don't. Update: None of the issues have been fixed. I stand by this review."", ""They are changing the game, it's no longer fun, they have changed the coin sharing, the treasure shrine and added the awful coin grubbing scavenger hunts. I do like the club I am nice people, but the developers are testing out new products that they know people will hate, pushing it on us, who wants less free coins, who wants a shrine that's impossible to win anything worthwhile.."", ""I really do like this game! I just started playing it..so I guess I have to play it a while longer to find out more about it. You know like whether I have to spend a lot of money to keep buying coins to play.. so far I have not run into a big issue with that. I don't mind spending a little money I just don't want to go bankrupt playing the game like SOOMME games I've played. you know like Ice Age Village... spend all that money on it and then have them just abandon the game!"", ""Great app for years, now just frustrating - more stressful than enjoyable. Boards are consistently set against the player, it's basically impossible to win more than a few games in a row w/out spending money for coins and boosters, and the chance to win both has been removed. Since jackpot changed I've only hit coins, but boosters aren't available, so what's the point really? Can't spare the coins to try anyway. The canned bot response to bad reviews - laughable, yet also somewhat insulting."", 'Its impossible to beat some levels unless you pay money to buy more coins, ""valcaoes"" and ""wild cards"". The developers have made this game to get people addicted to it so that they will spend money. NOT GOOD PRACTICE developers! I enjoyed the game till I figured it out. I will delete it!', 'Ran an experiment today. Every time you watch an advertisement you get to choose a card with a price on it. Thought it was a little strange that every time I picked a card, no matter what it was, I always got the lowest amount on the list. I understand they rig games like this to do that so that you watch more advertisements, but I wanted to know exactly what the extent of the tampering really was. Out of 300, won low 224x, med 76x, and won big exactly zero times.', 'This game is no longer fun! The programmers have ruined this game! There have been too many changes the jackpot you lose coins only 1 booster slot and it never lands on wild now, but did when medallion were in that spot. Help with coins changed we get less coins daily. And every game is difficult to win without buying extra cards several times, I refuse to spend money on this game ever!', ""The pick a pair card bonus is rigged to give you the lowest dollar amount no matter which card you choose. The changes you've made, in making the entire game harder will and is costing you in the long run. People are playing less and therefore costing you in advertising clients. The idea, I believe, is to have the ads pay you, lower the total skill levels back to where they used to be or close, and people will play the game more. Doing that can present a longer online presence to your clientele."", ""They ruined the game with greed. It used to be a really fun game. Now they've destroyed the game. You cannot win on the weekends, they've taken all the perks away. All they want is your credit card. When I run out of coins I'll probably quit playing. There are so many fun games you can play for free. I really used to love playing this game, now it just gives me a headache. And I'll never buy another Sony product again."", 'When are the developers going to listen to their customers? They have over complicated the game, made it more difficult to win games, and you have to buy boosters, wilds, and extra cards to win games. I used to love this game but now it had become a chore. My club mates keep me playing. The developers have made it an indirect requirements for you to buy coins and extras to win games. Not impressed with the updates. Over complicated a great game.', 'Whatever you did to the last update sucks. Performance is terrible. Used to take seconds to open now takes about 5 times as long.', ""Getting frustrated, says it needs a network. It started happening once in a while, not it won't let me play at all. Uninstalled a couple times and still has issue. I can use any other apps or go online so I know it's the game. My husband is starting to see same issue here and there. I'm about to uninstall permanently if it is still happening by end of day and look for new game."", 'Very cool game. I play it in my free time and get so caught up I sometimes end up late for things. lol! I love the challenge! FUN! I love it..', ""I would have played this game more if they could design to let us win more without using all kinds boosters. This game is getting harder to complete, unless you spend lots of money buying all of boosters. It's just a game, I don't like to keep on paying to play! No! Got to move on to different games."", 'I\'ve been playing this game for a couple of years and have gotten really involved in clubs. I have spent actual money on this game up until a few months ago. 1) The friend sharing center has been messed up and you ""have been working on fixing these issues"" for months and we are losing tons of coins 2) daily rewards come at different times daily 3)The quests are A LOT of work with very small pay out (150 red stars for 2 wilds?!) Listen to your long time players!! The game isn\'t fun anymore!!!!', 'Ive been playing for almost a year now. I use to love playing this game, as of late it has became very difficult to win any level without buying more cards. Ive seen many changes since ive started, mostly changes to hinder growth. I went from almost 13million coins to 5million coins in a month. And thats with spending money daily. I will be done once all my coins are gone and will no longer soend a dime on this game other than on dd day Its a shame that the developers have became so money hungry', ""Would rate it a 5 star but after the changes they made to friend sharing from every 4hrs to every 8hrs, and the changes to the Jackpot game making it impossible to get perks to help with ingame play. Instead you just dump your coins away. Clearly they have become greedy and decided to take a great game and force you into spending real money to purchase perks. I really shouldn't be so surprised, maybe it's because I got used to it being the way it was for so long. If it's not broke don't fix it!"", 'Getting harder and harder to pass levels. Plus what is the point of those two boats in the water. You click on one and suitcase opens. What am I missing?? Extra little side games to play? Someone said you had to download another app to play those. Please feedback on that. Make levels a little bit easier. I know it has to be a little challenging but not impossible üòúüòÇüòâ', ""Have been playing in a club for over a year. Prior to that I was not. I have since stopped as it became obvious the game is slighted when your are not in a club. You have to buy coins to even play, club or not. If you don't you can play maybe three games and then it's wait till the next day or buy more to line the pockets of the creators. It has ruined the game. They also raised their prices for the rescue packs to 35-50 bucks. GIVE ME A BREAK! That's a scam!"", 'Awful. Do not download. You can tell this game was made by some bad developer trying to break into the market by creating a game of chance that is impossible. Make it as addictive as possible, then make it super hard so they have to buy. And if you notice, all of the negative reviews are responded to with the same generic answer; clearly the developers do not have the slightest bit of understanding or care for their patrons. Deleting', 'Fun, at first. I sadly do NOT recommend this game. Its great at first but then it becomes very apparent that the game is designed to make you watch videos and buy extras because its extremely difficult to win without them. Everything about this game is rigged in their favor. I play regular Solitaire with no problem but this game is ridiculous. You can play level after level without getting cards you need. The statistics of this game are totally off! There are more fair game options available.', ""It's a bad game, but not insufferable if you like cards and are getting something for playing it (eg mistplay or tapjoy) The fact it costs so many coins per match and keeps asking you to buy them and they dribble in through a bottle neck, makes it hard to progress very fast at all tho, so itll take a few days to hit the stage specified"", 'The game use to be a 5 star game. Then they keep making changes. Like the new treasure hunt that they pick what levels you can play and use all your coins on. Everyone has told them how they didnt like it, yet the creators dont care. They dont listen to the players at all. They changed FB share which use to give you 60,000 coins a day. Now its friend center started out as 5 friends for 3000 every 4 hours. Now it is 3 friends every 8hrs. 100000s has quit the game.', ""Used to be a real fun game, but the developers have made it so you cant win a game without using boosters. Quests used to be fun with great rewards. Now there is little reward for double the work. They are pushing for in-app purchases, which I refuse to do. I really don't know how much longer I will be playing or want to put up with daily changes they make to the game."", ""Game used to be fun! Not any more! So many negative changes we can't even excel our club! Coins are being taken away when friend center was changed to every 8 hrs! Scavenger hunt steals coins and also rescue mission takes away coins! Grrrr! Complaints go unanswered or just generic responses! Testing, Testing, Testing! Stop the testing then, if thats the problem! We have 3 open slots on our club, but no one wants to join anymore!"", ""Excited to try this game but it was extremely disappointing. Imagine playing solitaire but you have to pay each round and if you run out of fake money you can play again for real money. That's fine except the premise is flawed when the RNG is so heavy that there's almost no strategy to the game. And you get punished by losing 500-1000+ coins for losing a level that is literally impossible to win. No thank you.""]"

Now I am unable to play as it simply freezes onscreen. Why ? What has happened? I have deleted and closed the tablet 3 times but every time I put the App back on same thing. Does anyone else have the same problem? DEVELOPERS can you please help fix this problem. ......well done developers..now a pleasure to play', ""I'm new at playing the game but really enjoy it. It takes a bit of brain power to play it and it was a free game to download....have been playing spider for awhile now. Love it. 10 our of 10. Just relearning Freecell. played it years ago. Quite complicated right now but love a challenge."", ""I have been playing this game so long since I can remember. It is nice that there is exp for every winning game so we can level up. Although there's nothing to do with it. But at least make the linked account works please. So i can continue my level in new phone."", 'Absolutely love it. The daily challenge, missions and level names keep me coming back for more every day. Currently at level 206 and want to see how high I can go and what the names will be', 'I like to challenge myself. It keeps me focus on how many minutes I can do it in and it is something I became very fun of playing. I would recommend this to a friend.', 'I play 3 of your games on Mobilityware and will not play any others, you have the best games.....love them! Keep up the great job....', ""I'm updating this review to ask MobilityWare how much money the St. Lucia Tourism Board is paying you to make their add play in its entirety? There's no option to turn the ad off after 5 seconds. Same with the Amazon ad. Enough! I play daily and never get bored. My only issue is the new ads are 30 seconds long. You guys say ads are only 5 seconds long or you can stop an ad after 5 seconds but that isn't the case anymore."", 'Lags when choosing cards, freezes up with 50% of the ads, so restarting game all the time. Love the game, but I remember when it was free with no ads. Developer came back and saw all users and is trying to get people to pay for ad free now. I get it and understand but a one time fee of a couple of dollars would be more appealing to purchase anything more seems ridiculous to me for this type of game. In short the game was great before all the extra stuff.', ""love the game but some ads, like word game won't let you go past them without closing game and starting over. don't like that at all."", 'I enjoy playing these games. Sometimes the ads make them glitch.', ""Finally sorted but it took several weeks so giving back up to 4 stars until certain the update is stable. It worked very well until the end of last week when it froze on both phone and tablet. Tried everything suggested to fix it without success. Tried reinstalling but that didn't work either. So have moved to a different app! Tried downloading again on the 9th of January. It was ok for about half an hour - then froze my tablet! Not good!"", 'I enjoy this game and accept the need for ads. Until recently, almost all ads could be exited after 5 seconds - but suddenly many ads after the 5 second mandatory viewing time, upon pressing the X, immediately takes me to the google play install page. Attempting to back out of that page only takes me back to the ad for the game. This then becomes a constant loop, that is frustrating enough that I exit the game rather than suffer through this. Toon Blast is one such ad but not the only one.', 'I love this app. I have others but I keep returning to pyramid and (just installed), spider. For months I haven\'t found any other place to express how much I enjoy the graphics. They\'re ""as fine as frogs hair"". Kudos to your staff. I have even enjoyed sharing with other 80+ year olds and they are hooked. I\'m downloading more apps. Which ones have graphics. Just think, healthier for us and fun. We look forward to and want to win even more.', ""The crashing issue has been fixed with a workaround of not logging in with google play if it crashed, which I guess is better than nothing. Pros: This is the best spider on the play store, because of responsiveness, great layout, card quality and ability to play in profile or landscape. Cons: I'm missing auto complete for when I've all but pretty much won the game though and have to just complete the stacks, which can feel pretty tedious. ---- Previous review ---- App has started crashing every time I try to play a game. The crash is caused by loading my play store account. I can still play the game as long as I never connect to the internet while playing, which is a bit crazy"", 'I have always loved this game. I played it on my first computer. Now I enjoy it on my phone. I really love daily challenge.', 'I enjoy this game, it keeps my mind alert & I enjoy the challenges it gives me!!!', ""Great game, but the ads absolutely kill the experience. I can only play like two deals before I'm fed up"", 'Fun game but the ads are terrible! Supposedly you can skip after 5 seconds but the ads have multiple ways of not closing.', ""It's fun, but repeats games. Recognized patterns after playing many games."", ""I play this on a chromebook. There is no facility in settings to increase suits above one. The company were quickly responsive, but being told to go into settings wasn't helpful as there's nothing there to increase suits. There's no contact button either. Is this a chromebook issue? Any advice apreciated."", ""I was wondering just how far this game would go up to and it's still going strong. Also love your cute dancing card character. I am at around level 850! It helps keep my mind sharp as well. I play first thing when I wake up and last thing wen I go to bed."", ""It's been my experience that MobilityWare games are the best! They are challenging and easier on the eyes to play, with lots of options for more challenging play modes! And, thanks to the developers I've never had one crash!"", 'Best of the free solitaire games. Cheap to go ad free & enjoy premium deck & card design options', ""Game works good but wish it would let you pick which deal you get..and can't look at my history to see what my previous times and number of moves is."", 'Really a lot of fun to play and it keeps your hand- vision sharp', 'Its relaxing, I love it. Its. Challenging at times, but I love it.', 'Good Solitaire gaming. Room for improvement. 1.Rotation flips on too slight of edge. Playing in non- rotation view is too small & narrow. Prefered if layout was already wide table view & play. 2. No options ( or no good free) of deck change nor any of background.', 'Fun, fun, fun. Challenging! Still my favorite strategy game.', ""Love this game been playing for months now, it's started freezing and not letting me press buttons or move cards yet the time keeps going, I've tried everything suggested and restarted my phone, paid for premium and have gotten quite far on levels and don't want to start over. Contacted support team awaiting response. I love this game and hope it can be resolved soon."", ""Nice game. Screen view is great. Background sounds not annoying. Like the easy use of just touching the card and it moves without dragging. Ads are not bad but I just don't want to pay to have them removed. Great little game. Kudos to developer."", 'They seem to have fixed the problem. Good job to the team. Back to a great way to spend some time. Used to be great. About 3 weeks ago it began crashing after about 2 seconds every time I loaded the game. Tried reinstalling and nothing changed.', 'This app has been brilliant for a long time, but in the last few days it has stopped responding to screen touches and then giving a is not responding error. . Reboot and reinstall did not fix. Huawei phone with android P. Hope this is fixed soon. Can confirm that this issue has now been fixed. Updated rating accordingly.', ""It froze up on me as I was fixing to hit level 285 I turned jn several crash reports no help whatsoever. I uninstalled spider downloaded it installed it froze up on me. Update after uninstalling spider for by the week I installed it again and it work just as good if not better than it did originally I don't know what caused it was it was an update and spider or updated in Android nevertheless it works I'm happy."", 'My touch screen is a little too sensitive, so I often make mistakes. Really a suggestion for new comers to change the sensitivity of their touch pad. Game is great fun!', 'Great challenge to keep you on your toes. Excellent pass,', ""This app stopped working in December. I have been waiting for an update. Unfortunately the app still doesn't work after the update. Uninstalled, installed and cleaned data. Still will not work. Please fix. Locks up phone. Update 1/14/20, they had another update today and this one worked! Thanks"", 'No matter how many suits I choose in the settings, I always get 10 card stacks, which makes it very hard for me to actually see them. Maybe a bug in changing the number of suits. Tried new play after each choice.', 'Played for over a year. Fun to play. I only play with 4 suits. Only complaint is that I lost about half of my bonus when I got a new phone. Won every game for a year straight.', 'When I first started I was 75 now I a 81 years old. I love this game it makes my brain work. Sometimes I cant see the numbers good i wish they were bigger.', ""Got another update today. My game works again! Thanks! I might play until my battery dies : D YAY Downloaded the new update & was so excited to get back to my game, but it's still broke. Something broke. Opened this app tonight & it won't work. It freezes as soon as I touch anything. I tried touching the daily goals, it froze. I closed it & reopened & touched it to deal a new game & it froze. This is 1 of 6 Mobility Ware apps I have on my phone & 2 of them are doing this tonight.""]"

I'm often reaching for my coffee & miss it. 2. This is a universal concern about games: there is no exit button. I must force the game closed by closing the window. Otherwise, I'm enjoying the game. When I have some money, I will get the no ads version."", ""Was a good game until the challenges were added in the last couple weeks. Now after playing 10 minutes the game slows down so much as to be unplayable. Disabled the automation, no change. Even worse when I play offline when I'm flying. Looking for a better one now,"", ""I absolutely love Mobilityware's Solitaire, and if it wasn't for the clickbait ads, I'd give it 5 stars. I get that ads pay for the game to be free, but we shouldn't have to close Google play store every time an ad completes. It's as if they are trying to force you to download whatever app they are advertising."", ""It,s hard & not sure they issue credits/scores to every person who is winning. But changed alot in the 6, 7 yrs I've played...I liked better back then...but I keep hoping I get my wins I deserve...I was 3rd place for years, but not have a clue where I am now! I just play for entertainment...I wish they would stop being liars on score...I still play & enjoy, but they need to fix! So gave them a 5, hoping this may help...ü§ûü§ûü§ûü§ûü§û"", ""I liked your game I installed on my 2014 phone because everything about it was better and I had a better chance of winning this is two games after how long ago did I download this. There's just something about this I don't like and it's just not quite the same but it's still your company oh well"", ""Lately the game freezes then shuts down and restarts. Frustrating when right in the middle of a game. Update: rarely does it now. This version of Solitaire is my go-to game. Update: Hasn't frozen up in quite a while so upgraded rating to five stars. New goals for additional points makes it more interesting. Appreciate not having many ads and can skip them after a few seconds."", 'This app is a data pig. I get data warnings all the time an app has used an abnormally amount of data. When checking this solitaire app is showing more data usage than my internet usage. This is only leaving me the choice to NOT use your app unless this is fixed. This app has already used 25% of my data plan. Way too much for a card game. Also I have selected SOUND OFF in the settings yet the advertisements still interrupt my Spotify music. Very annoying.', ""Great until the goals section was introduced. I would like go back to the original version! Looking for alternative game to download. Why did you need to mess with it? Solitaire is not a goal oriented game. If I wanted goals and points I would have downloaded something cheesy bright and annoying, which is exactly how this game is becoming. Very unhappy. So annoying thay I'm writing a review"", 'I use the app/game to keep my focus up to par. I notice the changes of age taking effect and I have ADD, so the game helps with putting order into my daily schedule. It would be a plus to challenge a human instead of a computer, unless there are those who can really complete a game in less than a minute!', 'Played this all the time but now the new ""goals"" checkmark in the corner is annoying me. I disabled all the goals options in the settings but the stupid checkmark is still there. My only ""goal"" is to just play the game, that\'s it.', ""Out of all solitaire on the play store app I find mobilityware to work and be the bestest one of all. Mobilityware has many other games I also play, I find them fun also relaxing, I have enjoyed mobilityware for years now and still my favorite. I highly recomend it to all. Also I very much enjoy the daily challenge's! I have many Mobility ware games I Love them all."", ""It was great until it started crashing mid-game sometimes two to three times a day. I uninstalled it and I'm now looking for another Solitaire game. I'll try your fix and, hopefully, I will enjoy this game again. You definitely have the better controls and graphics. Let's give this another shot, eh?"", ""I really enjoy all the game card games that you have solitaire, spider solitaire, all of them I like them because you don't always win. some of the card games you win every single hand and it's ridiculous because that don't just happen like that, so I like having to a work and win it I like all of them by you guys thanks for having them out thereüëç"", 'Much better than s lot of other similar games. Love the animations though I have yet to see anywhere near the allegedly 75 congratulatory animations and I did reach level 400. Not impressed with the tick with a 1 in the top right hand corner. A very confusing incentive to continue playing. Even the scoring/levels is baffling me. I just want to play Solitaire!!!!!', 'Used to be a good game. I do not know what has changed but after playing a couple of games my Galaxy tablet just about freezes, the game is just not what it was. Before, I could play for hours, now 2 or 3 hands and it is unacceptable, very slow....almost unresponsive. Guess it is time to find a new solitaire game. Enjoyed it when it worked proper. The daily goals option in my opinion is the culpit....I have disabled that new feature, restarted tablet and still does not perform very good.', ""This app has gotten worse gradually over the last couple of years. They seem to enjoy making new features for fun and constantly trying to improve it but instead keep making it more complex and annoying. Today's addition a bunch of pop ups for new daily goals. I just want a basic solitaire app that does a random deal with the option for 1 or 3 cards and an undo button. I don't need online leaderboards or daily deals."", 'Overall excellent play. I like the rewards and achievements. One problem: when something the solution to a winnable game, the animation moves too fast and the controls do not always respond.', ""BEST SOLITAIRE GAME EVER - been playing this one for YEARS!!!! Best game ever! EDIT: I have been a promoter of this version of solitaire for YEARS, and I would have considered buying the premium if they weren't SO obnoxious with the ads. I would have gotten premium to get extra custom content like card faces, but since they give you NO CHOICE and muscle you into buying it by slapping SO MANY long or multiple ads EVERYWHERE between games and making the app so obnoxious, I'd rather just move on."", ""I've been using this app for years and have been very pleased with it until recently. It was bad enough getting the intrusive adverts but that was something I could cope with. However the new daily goals is a real pain and there does not appear to be a way to opt out of it. It's getting to the stage that I will have to look for another solitaire app. Solitaire or Patience should be relaxing and frustration free."", ""New daily goals has slowed it to the point it's unplayable on my Samsung Galaxy Tab S2. Why can't the developers add a setting to turn the daily goals feature off? Not to mention the Leaderboard. I just want to play Solitaire; not lookimg to complicate it. Now I have to find a new Solitaire game that is responsive enough to make it enjoyable."", ""Used to be a great app to play solitaire on, but now it's constant adds with unneeded goals and screens that just take up your time as you try to play or start a new game. You used to be able to skip right out of the adds but now you have to watch a 10 second add every time you start a new deal"", 'It keeps freezing after a few games uninstalling and reinstalling t.he app works for only a few games. I have liked using this app until this recent problem developed. I really wish that Mobilityware will fix it so I can continue to play it Tg', ""Good solitaire game. I install it on my iPhone and paid for no ads. Just installed on my new Samsung phone and it want's me pay again. Wish I could transfer from one system to another."", 'I was at the 585th level on my other phone ,when it could no longer be charged. I still like to play this. Wish I could figure out how to put the icon on my homepage to excess.', ""Excellent experience I really enjoyed myself I couldn't stop playing I can play for hours the game is truly a fun game to play more fun when playing with others the game is awesome love it."", ""Have some good games when I play. I like that it gives you a hint because sometimes you don't see the move. Keeps you thinking, makes that brain keep working"", 'Too many ads, hate the idea of subscribing to remove ads. Additionally when the internet goes out it seems the probability of winning a game diminishes as well which is not cool.', 'Used to be fun. I have this to play solitair not some other f#%&ing game you want me to play. now in the middle of 2019 you have added stupid sounds. how can they be turned off? sounds like a dying rabbit. Get rid of daily goals. Makes it to damn easy and fast to get to next level.', 'I\'ve played the mobility version for ages until today. Irritating changes and distractions made it ""un-fun"" so it\'s now uninstalled. Found a plain, simple solitaire that\'s good enough for those who just wanna enjoy the game without levels and goals.', ""Was real happy with the game and the limit of ads to 5 seconds, until the latest update. Now there is a delay in the moves but, of course, the clock keeps on ticking. Became basically unusable. Also I don't really like the change in the settings interface."", ""system works great at times, then freezes. The clock is still running but you're not able to move. Very frustrating. Other times it just kicks you out."", ""Some ads can't be closed after 5 seconds like it claims. Some are VERY STICKY requiring you to crash out of the game and re-launch. Game publisher claim of 5 second cancellation is a lie."", 'A slick and smooth Solitaire game. Fun to play and has options to tailor to your mood. Highly recommend! Wasted many hours with a smile on my face.', ""Doesn't work properly, I transferred all my apps to a new tablet, lost my score of over 1100, have to start from scratch, which is ridiculous"", ""Played for years. Now the daily goals are intrusive to play. I can tolerate that. What's worse is the game slows to a crawl making it unusable. Too bad. This has happened in the past after an update."", ""I would give this app 5 stars unfortunately the downfall of this app is when you get a new phone you're unable to save your progress and have to start all over again."", 'More time is now spent having to watch the advertising then playing the game. More and More advertising. The yearly cost for none advertising is ridiculous high.', ""It's a great app, enjoyable to play. üòäThe vibrant colors are appealing to the eye, i get to choose my background & the back of the cards to my liking. I get helpful hints along the way & my time is recorded along with percentages of how ive done compared to other players."", 'I like it very much it has very nice appealing charming look sound color to it they did a great job making it the color of the black & red face of the cards needs to be birter the new card faces are the ones that need to be birter in color.', 'Thx for your response. Some adds do not have an x fast forward or close so I have to use the back key several times. I do not want to view or be interrupted by any adds and will have to find another app. But appreciate your quick response.']"

Addendum: Still having a lot of issues. I have to play the daily challenge several times before it actually registers that I've passed. It keeps moving me to a new course before I've passsed the previous one. There is o update, so I'm going to have to delete it, unless these things are fixed. It's not y device, either. It's brand new and all updates have been made. Please fix...."", ""You changed the game. It is so slow, it's NOT funny. Changing the format has taken the enjoyment out of it.I have also lost my proper set-up. I was aiming for the 300th daily challenge goal. I was over the 200 mark. I'm so angry. It WAS the one thing I got to enjoy playing, after work. If it is not changed back , I MOST definitely, will NOT recommend your games to anyone. Sad how things get changed, when there was nothing wrong with it. IF IT'S NOT BROKE, DON'T TOUCH IT."", ""The latest update is awful!! The game is slow and clunky now! Also the daily challenge now only shows the top five scores so you can't see how you did against everyone else! I used to enjoy playing but now it is so painfully slow I may uninstall it. Update - Wish there was a rating lower than 1! Now the daily challenge no longer records that you played it! I had over 300 days of daily challenges and they are gone and I am back to day 1 and it still won't record that I played! I'm done!!!!\U0001f92c"", ""WTH BFG? There was no notification about an update, but EVERYTHING has changed. The animation has all been modified to the point where it all appears to be moving in slow motion. The music, which used to be fine, is now the same obnoxious fragment over and over again. It's mind-numbing. There was nothing wrong with the game and if it ain't broken you don't mess with it. It is no longer PLAYABLE. I suspect I will be uninstalling. üòë"", ""I like the game but it keeps glitching, particularly the tournaments which now frequently start on hole 7, 8 or 9 and have all the levels checked when I haven't ever played them. What's up with the latest update? I can't turn off the sound now and it's not as smooth. I think I'm done with it and I'm just going to delete it. Besides, there's no reason why you need my contacts."", ""Most recent update makes the game almost unplayable. The icons at the bottom are too small to click without a stylus. Please change it back!! Also so many glitches! Levels seem to repeat and my streak has reset, despite the fact that I played the daily game. I can't turn the sounds off either!"", 'The latest update is pretty atrocious. Besides ALL my progress disappearing, despite logging back into my profile, the game is now a chore to play. The icons are smaller, movement/animations are slower and less responsive.. Really unfortunate.', 'I playing this game daily since aug 2016 , yesterday they make an update the worest one , tooo much slow and seem old not updated, please return the previous one', 'I\'ve played for 5yrs and I absolutely HATE the new update. It looks ugly & I feel like the whole sensory of the game is just off. Every card I tap lags a whole second before it moves anywhere. Also, I had saved a bunch of ""Cheevos"" to claim later- they were all coin rewards adding up to atleast 1800 coins- after the update, they were ALL GONE. The coins I had banked & already claimed were still there, but if I\'d known the unclaimed be rid of I would\'ve claimed them right away. Such a waste.', ""The card power ups are fantastic and you get them pretty often. This game quickly became a favorite of mine. I enjoy that I can play it and I don't get stuck waiting a long time for advancement, or have to sink money into the game to play. Super fun and keeps your brain working!!"", ""Good for killing time. I've been playing this game for years. It's not complicated, over ran with ads or always asking for more purchases. I get tired of games that always want you to buy more and more. This is one of my favorites. My husband and I try to best each others high scores all of the time"", ""I use to love this game but after it updated I can't even watch videos to get my daily rewards. I have uninstalled it a few times and nothing. Sad cause this was one of my favorite games."", ""Love the game, hate how buggy it is on my phone. Every few levels I need to close and restart the app. It won't let me choose a level, certain animations get stuck on the screen, or the game just freezes."", ""It's a great game and a lot of fun once I start playing I'm hooked and I don't want to quit and I end up playing until my battery dies. I would recommend this game to any body and everybody."", 'My favorite game! My only problem is that I have been playing this for a very long time and never backed it up. Have broken 2 devices so have had to start over AGAIN. Was over 1400 levels!', 'This is a fun take on a classic solitaire game. Easy to advance without spending money. Cute graphics and neat power ups.', 'Lots of fun and challenging. Keeps my mind working. Have to play almost every day. My 2 &3 year old great-granddaughters love ""helping Nana play"".', 'I think this is a very fun game. I like the different powwe-ups you get. I like the squirrels that run acrosscthe page; they make me laugh. I like the challenge of what I have to beat.', ""Not usually one to rate games but this game is AMAZING. It's not a pay to when, no ads unless u want them for powerups and coins and enough to do to keep you entertained for a long time!"", ""I really like the game and the challenges. If I could give some advice, when winning coins I would say +30 since they are being added to your total instead of √ó30 which means you're multiplying."", ""It's super addictive, I actually lose track of time playing it. I am not much of a game person but this game has grabbed me and I'm hooked. The graphics are good even the music is good all In all its just a really good, fun game. It also keeps your mind going especially when your trying not to make any mistakes. Thanks guys keep up the good work."", ""After playing daily for years, and loving it you decide to do something to make the game slow, unresponsive to moves, basically unplayable. Used to be smooth with great graphics and fun. Sadly I'll be uninstalling"", 'Very fun game so far, lots of nice rewards. Games not,impossible to win. Will rate again as I get further along.', ""I've gotten to level 500 and I play every day. But now I'm just frustrated and I don't want to play anymore. You have to do every board at least twice because you have to figure out where you're going to complete the challenge. I use 3 wild cards every time. It's just so frustrating I like a challenge I don't want to win every single time but having to play each board five / six times to figure out how to beat it. Not fun anymore just frustrating !"", 'I am not sure I totally ""get\' this game. I guess once I have gotten enough points it is okay for me to blow up the rest of the cards? same backgound when I play the game. Boring.', 'Fun but not as good as fairway solitaire. I miss the commentators. This seems like it was made for a younger crowd.', 'I love the game and the different challenges each level persents. Its an awesome game, Im determined to complete all levels. When I play I forget my problems and worries of the day, Im more focused on getting 3 stars and going onto the next challenging level. I rate this card game 100 stars. Thanks', ""I really enjoy the game. It makes me feel like a kid once again with all the characters and sound effects. A great way God's allowing me to heal. Have a great day all!"", 'Fun to play-!and yet... Not enough coins during play. To get through harder levels requires real cash for virtual coins.', ""I love this game, especially the boosts.

Keep going back to it because it's so much fun.Here I am back,It's slot of fun!"", ""Fun and very addicting. It is a nice fast paced version of solitaire.

-Bug fixes and improvements","['Its a good platform for playing solitaire but every time you start a new game those annoying ads not only pop up on the entire screen but it freezes and glitches so when you try to close out the ad you just click on another one because it slows tbe device down but its probably designed to do just that. I hate those ads.', ""Game play good but ads make it unplayable. Most have audio and occasionally they will hijack you so you have to kill the app process to get back to the game. Got a reply from the developer asking me to report bad ads. There's the issue. Why do I have to tell you about ads in YOUR game??? Screw that. There are other games."", ""I've played several different solitaire games but I find this one slow. By that I mean the the player has to place all the cards up on the aces themselves. Other games it does it automatically when it's obvious that the player has won. Also at end of game the cards returning to the deck is slow and takes too long."", ""Lazily made Ad-farmer. The game's RNG system sets up a lot of no-win games and doesn't have a way of letting a player know when they're out of viable moves. Coupled with the fact there's an ad every time you reset and start a new game, I'm convinced that this game was very deliberately made to only farm the user for ad-viewership to earn adsense money. Dont get it, better apps exist."", 'Great game always plays fairly but always a challenge. Never play more than eight games before winning one. Graphics are great with options. Plenty of various style games with scoring depending on what a person is use to. Many others not even close.', 'My primary complaint that I could not exit game was clarified by Brainium Studios.

Some of the ads last longer than the games, seems a bit excessive.', 'Too many ads including ones that will not go away!

You can pick up many cards from the discard pile (judging from what's in there) but you run the risk too of having them count against you if the round ends.. I always loved the risk of going negative in the game.. Oh if only there were an option to go to 1000 points! There's such turns of events in those longer games! There's so many options in rummy!"", ""I love this game! You don't have to earn coins or gems or any other ridiculous thing to continue playing. Play is unlimited. There are ads, but only one 5 second ad in between each game, which consists of 4 to 5 hands. If you do make a single in game purchase, all ads go away permanently.

I find it very engaging and helps keep mind busy when things are slow at work or waiting for appointments etc."", ""It seems when I have a Joker card and have a specific play, the joker gets designated to hit on something else, leaving me with 2 cards that are then useless. Also, when computer picks up from the floor, it's not obligated to throw down a set using that pick-up card, meanwhile, I'm only able to pick up a card that can be used in a set. It's very aggravating, and I chose this game as a way of relaxation. I may have to find some other 500 rummy game or just give it up altogether."", ""This is a fun game besides the ads .I am not purchasing anything to get rid of all the senseless ads.

FAQ
1) How are the opponents unique?
Each opponent has different strategies and goal.  The higher level opponents are more likely to knock, whereas the lower levels prefer to play for gin.  Higher level opponents rarely pick up cards from the discard pile to avoid revealing their hand.  And just like the real-life pros, the highest level opponents keep track of discards to know which cards are still ‚Äúlive‚Äù.

2) Do the opponents cheat?
Absolutely not!  They don't get better cards, they can not see your hand.  How would that be fun for you, our valued customer?  

3) How are the cards dealt?
Cards are dealt randomly, just as if you were using a real deck.  

4) So why am I not winning?
Gin Rummy is a complicated game.  While easy to learn, it requires a lot of skill and strategy to master.  Check out the ‚ÄúStrategy‚Äù section under Help for some valuable tips and tricks.

5) But sometimes the opponent knocks right away. 
In any card game there is also a lot of luck.  If you play for a while, you'll get your share of lucky hands too!

6) Why didn't my game download?
Occasionally there are glitches that interrupt a download and cause it to fail.  Usually if you just try again it will work fine.  If not, you may want to clear the Market cache by going to Settings -> Applications -> Manage Applications -> All -> Market -> Clear Cache AND Force Stop.  Then retry the download.

Easy to understand, challenging to play! Originating from India this game of Rummy also known as ""indian kerala rummy"", is conquering the world! So watch out! It gets you before you know it and you will have a hard time cutting yourself loose.

The objective is easy: get rid of your penalty points as soon as possible. You can do
this by collecting runs (at least three consecutive cards of the same suit) or sets
(three or four of the same cards from different suits). But you need at least two runs
before the scoring starts. And one of this runs has to be without a joker!

Each turn you take a card and discard one. Are you the first that has a hand full of
runs and sets? The game is yours! The faster you achieve this, the bigger the chance
you leave your competition far behind. And that will boost your statistics!

Will be great if there are 3 decks of cards. If the developer adds 3 decks, the game should allow for a set of 3 cards of the same value and suit are in the hand to be the same as first life. For example, 3 Ace of Spades cards. 4) The shuffling of the deck is suspicious. I draw the high value cards (J, Q, K, 10, A) about 90% of the time, so reducing points from my current set of cards on hand is very difficult. 5) When I have a first life (or compulsory sequence that we used to call it in India), it should not count those cards in the penalty count. 6) It should limit max penalty to 80 (""book""). 7) It should allow for shorter or longer games.

I hate the new format, as the card layout and background make it difficult to see. But worst of all, are the ADS! Ads pop up and you have to wait for up to 30-40 seconds for the ads to finish before you can tell it ""No"" and continue on with playing. Even then, after 2 or 3 iterations of ads, you have to close the game out and reopen it to continue playing. They took an excellent game and ruined it. DO NOT DOWNLOAD!', 'This used to be the only game I played, and I loved it. I played it for YEARS on every phone and tablet I had. I am VERY dissatisfied with the latest ""update"". It looks cartoonish, ugly and there are too many ads. There was NOTHING wrong with the old version. It was grown-up, intelligent and made total sense. I HATE this new version, and that view is apparently shared by many other (ex) users. It WAS a great game, before the update. Restore the old version without ads, or bye! You ruined it!!!', 'After seeing NEW version ... now I remember why I downgraded original comments ... gotta say, ""This version sucks!!"" Can barely see cards. New opponents are ridiculous. Why did you destroy a perfectly great version to create this 2nd grade version!?! Bring back prior version & you\'ll have a 5* game!!!', 'Not a fan of the new look. The cards are smaller, hard to see. Can not change the deck style or board/background. Biggest issue is the cards size. Please fix issue. Go back to other design. Lost my stats in update. Have not played the game since the update.', 'Excellent logic as programmed. Would have rated it at 4 stars, but it\'s first opponent - ""NooB"" - appears twice consecutively in a tournament It\'s likely an elementary coding error. when fixed It would warrant a 5 if also it\'s scores would show on a note 9, and if it would display cards played per hand.', ""The new update sucks. I've played this game for years on probably 6 or 7 different devices. I'm uninstalling it. I can't believe this cartoony look was preferred over the classic look it has been for years. VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE LATEST UPDATE!"", ""I used to love this game; it was one of my favorites for years. After this last update, however, I think I'm done. I stuck with this app when the developers added controversial opponents, came out with the polarizing ad system, etc. This latest update took away the thing I appreciated most: The look and feel. This now feels like I'm playing a kids cartoon game rather than gin rummy. The changes in card appearance, background, and opponents was too much at once."", 'The new interface is trash. It looks like you gave your beautifully designed and easily playable game to the new person who knows NOTHING about game design, asked them to give it a new hairdo, then accepted all the changes without looking at them. And the full playing adds! If I can\'t exit out of the add, I exit it of the game. And you really need to get rid of that totally racist beginner character! WHY did you ""fix"" something that wasn\'t broken at all? You\'ve shot yourselves in the foot.', ""Way to ruin it! I have had this ap on my phone for years, and it's always been a great time killer. But your latest update wiped the progress made, and the ads are now constantly popping up. You used to be able to skip them, making it a little less annoying, but now you are forced to sit thru them. And $6.99 for a card game to get rid of the ads?? Are you people high?! Uninstalling immediately."", 'YOU RUINED IT! I\'ve been playing this game for literally years. When I open it today I find an ugly new interface that doesn\'t even display correctly on my S7, but the opponent I\'ve been playing (again, for years) is gone, replaced by childish cartoon characters. Crud, I\'ve got a lot of time invested in the match with my opponent! The colors scheme is a garish gold instead of a more traditional ""green felt"" look. Looks like I have to look for a new Gin game. I was willing to put up with the intrusive ads, but I\'m not willing to put up with losing my progress and an ugly, ugly interface and infantile graphics. EDIT: I think it is adorable that the developer thinks I am going to take the time to get this abomination to display correctly. The problem isn\'t on my end, it\'s on the developer\'s end. Also, my opponent is gone and my running progress against that opponent is gone, so no matter what my saved statistics are, they don\'t transfer to a new opponent. Read the reviews of your users and see what a great job you did on this update. I\'m off to play someone else\'s game.', 'Was a great game- WAS! You ruined a classic card game! Been playing for years but I dread playing the ""new"" Down Date! You can\'t possibly call it an Update! Took a classic and made it look like a kids toy. Read every ones latest reviews. No one likes it! Fire the study group who approved this garbage! I hope you didn\'t pay staff for poor excuse for an improvement. Whoever is in charge of it should live by the sword! Read the reviews! Listen to the long time users. No one likes it!', ""This app used to be good--one of my favorites to play. But with the recent update it's terrible! The graphics are much worse--the cards are smaller, making it harder to see & to select the appropriate card. It looks too cartoon--too juvenile. And the ADS... OMG. You are required to sit through an ad after pretty much every hand, & for 30 seconds for some! Ridiculous. I'm super bummed cuz I really miss the way it had been. Uninstalling."", ""I played this app for years, and finally bought it, it was so good. They recently radically changed the format; I can no longer read the cards well enough to play (smaller, with bizarre icons and contrasts; I am 70). Can't be changed in preferences.

Excellent!"", ""Used to absolutely love this game! Keyword here is used to! I hate the ads and the fact u can't put cards in order like before!"", 'Hate the new look, loaded the game today and thought somehow the wrong game got installed. The cards are much harder to read now and distinguish. And since I purchased this app, I\'m really feeling ripped off. Time to look for another gin Rummy game. If I could find a way to install the last version and then disallow updates, I would keep it, but so far haven\'t had any luck with that. Edit: it\'s not as bad on my 10"" tablet, cards are easier to read, but that bright yellow card back is horrid.', 'The ""new and improved "" look is awful. I can\'t tell the difference between any red cards, which causes me to draw or discard the wrong thing. Wish you had design options to choose from. Too cartoonish for my taste. I will be deleting this app and trying elsewhere. Previous version would have gotten more stars.', ""Oh dear god, what HAPPENED? I'm not certain that there's been much changed in play, because the game went from a simple, perfectly fine appearance to a horrible pre-school experience, without even an option to revert. Looks like I'm either going to have to source an old version to install, or switch to some other gin app, because I couldn't even get through two games without wanting to scrub my eyes with a wire brush."", ""Horrible New Interface!! üôÅ This was the only game I played, & I will now DELETE it & will find a different company/gin game. Your new design is NOT beautiful!! Did you even test it?? I tolerated the ads when you added them in... losing my progress - against selected opponents, but I did start over. This update you guys really messed up. Again, I have lost all my stats. You have way to many choices of players & frankly I'm quite upset - stunned you guys would create such a stupid move. FAIL!"", 'NOT FIXED YET. HAVE TO PLAY THE SAME DUDE NOOB EVERYTIME IN TOURNAMENT MODE! SUPER SMALL CARDS I hate the new look. The cards are small and hard to see. The ads drive me crazy. You cant see the score for your opponent. All the ads are 30 seconds and it turns your sound off between each round. Deleting will try again to see if they ever fix it. SO SAD BEEN PLAYING TNIS GAME FOR YESRS. SOMEONE SHOUD BE FIRED OVER THIS.', ""New format is no good. Looks like it's aimed at a 10 year old. Been using this game for a long time, but now need to delete it if i can't undo last update. Avatars look childish cartoons, hand cards are harder to read at a glance on phone screen, scoreboard harder to read. Not worth my time any more."", ""The previous version was my go-to game for years. The icon for the app remains the same but when I loaded it to play today, I was completely taken aback. Nothing about this updated version is even remotely the same! The bright gold and small cards make it extremely hard to see...and I'm in my 20s! I tried to find the option to at least switch the display to something a bit easier on my eyes, with no luck. It looks like I'll be joining the rest of you in the endeavor to find a better app!"", ""great game but too many ads.. Update: i spoke too soon! the new update is awful..it wiped out my current rating and doesn't display it anywhere..the cards are much harder to see..the old opponents looked like actual people, not childlike cartoon characters.. everything about it is a downgrade.. fire whoever revamped this game immediately!"", 'After the new update, I will now be uninstalling what used to be my favorite game. This UI is the worst I have seen, and I will not tolerate it. The cards are hard to see/read, the avatars are way childish, and overall the game is not ""pretty"" like they claim it to be. Very disappointed.', 'I have no problems with ads, but this game is beyond. I deleted it after 10 minutes, there is an ad after each game. That in itself is not as bad as they not even waiting for you to realize that the game is over before showing an ad. I wish there was an option of minus 1 star.', ""NO, GO BACK, THIS IS AWFUL! I have played this app since my first tablet years ago. I have always loved it, and got my family hooked on it. Now we all hate it. This new look is horrible. It is distorted, I cant even read half the buttons. Its changed the way the game looks, feels, and plays. How do I go back? I didn't even mind when you added in ads. I get it, you need to make money. I want this update gone, or the game is gone off my tablet. I am off to look for a replacement."", ""Not enjoying the updates. Ads get in the way sometimes and game play isn't as smooth. Game doesn't track points the way it used to and often you have to exit the app to get passed some screens (like the examine hand.) I prefer the minimalistic design from before and will be looking for a replacement."", ""Used to be good, but now opponent avatars are requited, and they are huge and hideous. Can hardly see the cards. Deeply disappointed, will likely uninstall, which is a shame because pre-update, this was the best Gin Rummy app I'd tried. I've used it for years but recent update to graphics is horrid."", ""Too cartoon..prefer older look..should make it an option to change layout and presentation of the game..when moving the card,sometime cannot see the card we're holding because the card os too small..card no 4 and A is very similar..the numbering on the card is too small..but i like the added level of difficulty.."", 'The new Format is absolutely terrible. I used to play every day that I never play anymore.', ""Hate this new version, can barely read the cards, very difficult to move cards because they are so small. Going to look for a different version. Ashame, I have been playing the older version for years. Didn't even have the option to not upgrade."", 'I liked it much better before this version. The new graphics make the cards harder to read. Too many ads now. It used to rate 5 all the way through even with the few ads that popped up, but someone really screwed up this game.', ""Long time user. I thought I had somehow opened the wrong application, for surely this was not my beloved Gin Rummy. I uninstalled and reinstalled with the hope that there'd been some tragic error. You can't possibly think this new look is an improvement! Very disappointed!!!"", ""I used to like this game, it was simple. Now it's cartoony and I have no idea where the menus have gone. Also- your ad situation is garbage and nobody is going to pay that much to remove them. Gonna find a new game now."", 'Great app! But, the font and suits need to be larger for us older folks! And why do we have to play Noob twice to advance?', ""Recent update has made this unusable on my phone (S9). Now the text is all over the place images and animations are overlapping on top of each other. Pitty since I've been using it for years!"", ""You broke it. Was one of my favorites. Ads are usually okay, but when you have to watch it for 30 seconds between each hand, that's not nice. The look is now completely unrecognizable. Uninstalling. Good bye."", 'Update ruined the game. Bunch of money grubbing fools got their hands on this and ruined it. My profile reset and I lost everything. Way way to many intrusive adds. Basically unplayable unless your cough up $6.99. Crazy expensive. Uninstall!!!', 'Used to be a great gin game. Now banner ads and a timed ad after every hand and way too expensive for purchase. Bye...bye...', ""I used to love this game because of its simplicity and straightforward, easy-to-read UI. Loved the tournament option. Not sure after this weird update. Doesn't seem like the same app anymore."", ""There was nothing wrong with this game, now it awful. The whole look is awful. It still functions fine but scores are no longer on the home screen.

Gin Rummy,com.sleepwalkers.ginrummy,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sleepwalkers.ginrummy&hl=en&gl=us,"Gin Rummy is a hugely popular card game, where the aim is to form sets and runs of cards before your opponent. It's simple and quick to play, and if you are new to the game then Gin Rummy provides everything you need to learn it!

A member of the Rummy family, Gin Rummy is an immensely popular card game owing to the high skill component of the game when compared to other casino card games.

It is a two-player card game. Gin Rummy is played with a standard 52-card pack of cards. The ranking from high to low is King, Queen, Jack, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, Ace (kings over aces). 

The objective in gin rummy is to score points and reach an agreed number of points or more, usually 100, before the opponent does.

The basic game strategy is to improve one's hand by forming melds and eliminating deadwood. Gin has two types of meld: Sets of 3 or 4 cards sharing the same rank, e.g. 8‚ô• 8‚ô¶ 8‚ô†; and runs of 3 or more cards in sequence, of the same suit. e.g. 3‚ô• 4‚ô• 5‚ô• or more. Deadwood cards are those not in any meld. Aces are considered low‚Äîthey can form a set with other aces but only the low end of runs (A‚ô† 2‚ô† 3‚ô† is a legal run but Q‚ô† K‚ô† A‚ô† is not). 

A player can form any combination of melds within their hand, whether it contains all sets, all runs, or a mix of both. A hand can contain three or fewer melds to knock or form legal gin.

The deadwood count is the sum of the point values of the deadwood cards‚Äîaces are scored at 1 point, face cards at 10, and others according to their numerical values. 

Intersecting melds are not allowed; if a player has a 3-card set and a 3-card run sharing a common card, only one of the melds counts, and the other two cards count as deadwood.

Call Gin if you have no deadwood other than your discard, or knock if your deadwood is 10 points or less. At the end of a hand, the winner scores their opponent's deadwood points and a bonus for Gin!

After discarding a card, you can end the round by knocking if your deadwood point is less than or equal to 10. Then your opponent will have a chance to lay off his deadwood cards if those cards can form melds with those of yours. After that, if your deadwood point is less than your opponent's, you will be awarded a score equal to the difference in the deadwood points. But if your opponent has a smaller deadwood point, this is called an ""undercut"" and he will receive 25 points plus the difference in the deadwood points. 

If you have no deadwood then your opponent will not be allowed to lay off, and an extra 25 points will be added to your score. The game ends when the score of a player reaches 300. 

A player wins the hand by being the first to play all the cards in their hand by either melding, laying off or discarding. Once a player has gone out, the hand is ended. No other players may meld, lay off or discard their cards even if they have valid combinations already in their hand.

New and experienced players can all enjoy this game by utilizing the three different game type - Straight Gin, Oklahoma Gin, Hollywood Gin.

Saddle up and prepare for the most addictive Gin Rummy game.

Gin Rummy is a terrific game that you're sure to enjoy. Score Big with Gin Bonus, Big Gin and Undercut!

Form as many melds as you can to become the champion of Gin Rummy!

Mahjong Solitaire,com.sg.js.Mahjong,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sg.js.Mahjong&hl=en&gl=us,"Mahjong solitaire is a solitaire matching game that uses a set of Mahjong tiles rather than cards. The computer game was originally created by Brodie Lockard in 1981 and named Mah-Jongg after the game that uses the same tiles for play. Lockard claims that it was based on a centuries-old Chinese game called ""the Turtle"". However, it was not until Activision released Shanghai in 1986 for the Macintosh and Apple IIgs that the game gathered momentum. A version of this game was also included in the Microsoft Entertainment Pack for Windows 3.x in 1990 and went by the name Taipei. It was subsequently included in the Best of Windows Entertainment Pack. Premium editions of the Windows Vista operating system and Windows 7 include a version of the game known as Mahjong Titans.
As any other successful game, millions of clones have been created on all possible platforms. So why should you give our version a try? We tried to recreate all the fun of original game with 60 different layouts in a tiny download package.
A tile that can be moved left or right without disturbing other tiles is said to be exposed. Exposed pairs of identical tiles (Flower and Seasons tiles in the same group being considered identical) are removed from the layout one at a time, gradually exposing the lower layers to play. The aim of the game is to clear the layout by pairing up all the tiles. The game is finished when either the layout is empty, or there are no exposed pairs remaining.

I came to the Google store to \nsee how many bad reviews you\'ve gotten, plus to see customer satisfaction \nnumbers. I find it odd that if you add up the number of 4 star 3 star 2 \nstar and 1 star reviews, they come out exactly the same number, 3026, as \nthe five star reviews. Are you cooking the numbers?

Thought it was a little strange that every time I picked a card, no matter what it was, I always got the lowest amount on the list.

Out of 300, won low 224x, med 76x, and won big exactly zero times.', 'This game is no longer fun! The programmers have ruined this game! There have been too many changes the jackpot you lose coins only 1 booster slot and it never lands on wild now, but did when medallion were in that spot. Help with coins changed we get less coins daily.

The changes you've made, in making the entire game harder will and is costing you in the long run. People are playing less and therefore costing you in advertising clients.

Doing that can present a longer online presence to your clientele."", ""They ruined the game with greed. It used to be a really fun game. Now they've destroyed the game.

There are so many fun games you can play for free. I really used to love playing this game, now it just gives me a headache. And I'll never buy another Sony product again."", 'When are the developers going to listen to their customers? They have over complicated the game, made it more difficult to win games, and you have to buy boosters, wilds, and extra cards to win games. I used to love this game but now it had become a chore.

Listen to your long time players!! The game isn\'t fun anymore!!!!', 'Ive been playing for almost a year now. I use to love playing this game, as of late it has became very difficult to win any level without buying more cards. Ive seen many changes since ive started, mostly changes to hinder growth. I went from almost 13million coins to 5million coins in a month. And thats with spending money daily. I will be done once all my coins are gone and will no longer soend a dime on this game other than on dd day Its a shame that the developers have became so money hungry', ""Would rate it a 5 star but after the changes they made to friend sharing from every 4hrs to every 8hrs, and the changes to the Jackpot game making it impossible to get perks to help with ingame play. Instead you just dump your coins away. Clearly they have become greedy and decided to take a great game and force you into spending real money to purchase perks. I really shouldn't be so surprised, maybe it's because I got used to it being the way it was for so long. If it's not broke don't fix it!"", 'Getting harder and harder to pass levels.

Deleting', 'Fun, at first. I sadly do NOT recommend this game. Its great at first but then it becomes very apparent that the game is designed to make you watch videos and buy extras because its extremely difficult to win without them. Everything about this game is rigged in their favor. I play regular Solitaire with no problem but this game is ridiculous. You can play level after level without getting cards you need. The statistics of this game are totally off! There are more fair game options available.', ""It's a bad game, but not insufferable if you like cards and are getting something for playing it (eg mistplay or tapjoy) The fact it costs so many coins per match and keeps asking you to buy them and they dribble in through a bottle neck, makes it hard to progress very fast at all tho, so itll take a few days to hit the stage specified"", 'The game use to be a 5 star game. Then they keep making changes. Like the new treasure hunt that they pick what levels you can play and use all your coins on. Everyone has told them how they didnt like it, yet the creators dont care. They dont listen to the players at all. They changed FB share which use to give you 60,000 coins a day. Now its friend center started out as 5 friends for 3000 every 4 hours.

The ads can be annoying, but that's the price of free play. The AI does not always play fairly or seemingly well but decent enough to give a challenge and make you want to come back to have another crack at it. The maker seems to be interested in improving their product, which makes me a fan."", 'The makers of this app are actively involved in clickjacking. Ads are displayed that you cannot close for 30 seconds without installing whatever they advertise. Ads that you do close continue to run in background, often with audio that you can\'t turn off. They play ads with audio even if you have the game itself muted, overriding settings. Gameplay isn\'t bad, but the rest overshadows it. **amended after vendor response** Perhaps ""clickjacking"" is too strong a word, even though when you try to hit the ""x"" in the corner of the full screen add it still takes you to the play store. Some of the ads even have fake ""x"" nuttons to entice you to click on them before the app-delayed ""x"" button is displayed. No other app I use on my phone plays audio ads when I have the app silenced. That fact that this one does (as do other games using this same engine) and that the vendor response is ""turn down media volume"" which has the effect of silencing other apps that I don\'t want silenced is not an acceptable answer. However, what is even less acceptable is that this app downloads and plays these ads in background WITHOUT DISPLAYING THEM TO THE USER. If it wasn\'t for the audio bug we wouldn\'t know that the ad was running in the background. So, instead of calling it ""clickjacking"" should we instead call it ""impression fraud""? After all, it is an incontrovertible fact that the ads are downloaded and run without displaying them to the user. It is troublesome that the vendor claims the app has no control over the audio of the ad - which would seem to verify that the app is downloading and executing code instead of displaying a banner. Again, that this is executing in background is a huge problem. Often after the ad is displayed the phone suddenly starts running sluggishly, even so far is disrupting animation in gameplay. So what is the ad doing that is so CPU intensive? Cryptomining perhaps? I realize that you don\'t have much control over the content of the ads, but you do have control over what ad networks you use.', 'Very entertaining when you have time on your hands']"

Eternal is exactly the same game, just with different words of terminology. For example: in MtG, ""lands"" provide ""mana"" to cast spells. In Eternal, ""sigils"" provide ""power"" to cast spells.

I purchased a founders pack years ago so you can trust me when I say I know the game inside out. Most of the people complaining about it being too hard have never played Magic or have no idea how to play a card game that doesn't hold your hand like Hearthstone.

Again closest to mtg quality. Sadly it is p2w pretty much. But if you find people close to your tier might be better. UI is very badly designed, especially combat.

Thats just ridiculous for what the campaigns give.(up to 16 levels for some, up to 20 for another. Keyword ""up to"". Also thats 20 matches. Dont think its actual missions with multiple matches.nope. 20 matches for close to 15$.) Mobile games have become ridiculous. All rip offs, cash cows, p2w schemes and stamina schemes.

I've been playing for a little over half a year and hit top 250 masters at one point with my own deck.

Can I suggest to the devs to update your app image? Blue haired gunslinger woman is a bit dated set wise and the art is a little cartoonish compared to other cards"", 'Great game, big huge flaw they apparently have no remedy for: played quite a while ago, uninstalled and reinstalled the game; the game remembered my ""level"" without remembering my cards. Id have no problem resetting my account and having to get the cards again... Except you cant for some reason. Theres no ""reset"" for your account. So now i have no cards and i have no way to earn new cards because my level is too high and it takes forever to earn anything. I dont undsrstand how this happens.', 'This is a game with potential, however two stand out complaints drive me close to uninstalling on many occasions. First is deck composition rules: instead of flat number requirements like MTG (whose mana system eternal uses), eternal forces you to to have mana proportional/fractional to at least one third of your deck. This makes it highly likely you get hit by mana flood. The second is that out of all the digital CCGs eternal has an exceptionally bad shuffling algorithm.', 'its a great game, with tons of depth and a wonderful selection of janky cards for fun and semi competive off meta builds. The game does struggle with the issue of certain cards being pushed and power creep is certainly visable between sets. the games f2p model is generous and rewards daily play. all in all the game has faults but the many many benefits and positive aspects out way them.', ""This used to be a really good game, but the developers are ruining it with new broken game mechanics that basically allow players to circumvent the general gameplay strategy and coast to an easy victory with 2 or 3 cards...this is almost consistently done through the use of specific cards only unlockable through the new pay to win system. In other words, if you're not shelling out cash for cardpacks riddled with virtual mechanical cheats, then your win probability has plummeted with these added."", 'So first off, fun game. If you enjoy magic or hearth fire great game. However, it has a serious issue with ""shuffling"". I will go 10 games seeing the same cards from my deck. Not seeing many others. Or only seeing some once in awhile despite having copys in my deck. I will also go game after game drawing only power sigils. Or only monsters. How in a deck of 90 do I draw 10 power cards in a row??? Again it\'s fun. But there are days that it\'s very frustrating.', ""Every game is definitely not random card selection. It's always set up for one player to win. Very frustrating when you get into it. You might not notice at first but you'll soon start to see it happen"", 'Best digital card game I have ever played, and I tried MTGA/MTGO, HS, TESL, Shadowverse and LoR! Love the incredible amount of different game modes and how you can play everything without spending a cent. Just amazing..', 'Game was fun until I realized that my favorite mode forge was completely rigged. The enemies have preset hands while you have to fight rng. You make your deck with rng, power is added to your deck through rng, you then draw all hands through rng while the enemies are guaranteed preset decks, and then guaranteed to draw units and power.', ""The game, at an initial glance is good and interesting. However, it quicky becomes apparent this game has nasty flaws. Given a review post limit, I cannot list them all. There is one however, I'd warn (unless you're one those cancerous people whom condone the effect) about. This game has a Mill-loss mechanic. Which for the victim of the Miller is little more then sitting back and watching the Mill player fornicating themself. Good idea, bad game implementation, with Auto-Win/Loss like that. 1/5"", 'Fun game. It is much more like MTG than hearthstone, but with enough differences to not be a copy of MTG. At first I was having a great time playing. Eternal has a lot of free gold and packs to earn. But, I was disappointed to see how many cards are only available from buying campaigns. It is possible to grind for the gold without purchasing, but the amount of gold needed for campaigns is very high.', ""Eternal is a fun CCG that has elements of both MtG and Hearthstone, but unique in its own way. Regardless what others are saying, you dont need to pay for card packs and expansions, as you can buy 'em with coins that you get at the end of every win. Truth is, it can take a while, but as one of the free to play players, that owns all expansions, i can guarantee it. Very fun game, with a lot of various deck builds. I wholeheartedly recommend it."", 'Super impressed with this game. Great work.', 'One of the most underrated CCGs in my opinion. Feels like a perfect mix of the other popular Card Games on the market now plus has a more generous market structure. Very easy to go free to play and still hit high ranks. Highly recommend!', 'It\'s like the baby of MTG and Hearthstone, and sucks a little less. The ""lands"" you use to play spells is set up way better than MTG\'s, and it\'s pretty f2p. Also, I like how it seems a better system than MTG Arena. Deck creation is great, and they have a comperable amount of cards per set. Drafting is fun as well, and most other players have been incredibly nice during play. Great game, 11/10, will keep playing for sure. Will stop playing magic, too.', 'this is the best gaming app. the music is so so and the maps are kinda all dark colors,,but this is the best gaming app. you have more time to complete most games. you can make the games speedy if you like.', ""Epic helpful support team only wish is when I decide to take a brake I wish my missions could stack wish it took less space.... Advice for the devs in Deck view mode please add an option to clear the deck while in the deck view so we don't have to tap on every card to clear it"", 'Reinstalled game, and got back to playing. After playing long enough, got the feel how to counter flying decks. Now the only thing that makes me want to stop playing is, that more often than not you either get stuck with the power you had on your starting hand, or you end up drawing only power cards, both that ruin your game pretty spectacularly.', ""I don't really do comments, but this card game is amazing! I've been playing with CCG for ages and this game really deserves probably more than 5 stars well balanced and really generous as well.. Its basically a free game that you can grind and get cards you need plus playable on almost all platforms. That said, I will still spend money on it not only because of getting a head start but the purpose of mainly supporting the team and the brilliant brains behind this masterpiece."", ""Draw ratio can be a little frustrating(try to find a card game mana system that isn't) but overall a very well polished and rewarding free to play card strat. Great artwork and mechanics, dont have to pay a cent if you dont want to..... asterisk for online play, still very pay to win but what can you do. More choices for less expensive single player game modes would be nice and as a final positive I am really enjoying the deck builder, easy to jump right in and get building"", ""It's a great game but the deck shuffling is very unbalanced. It's always either too much power and not enough units or too many units and not enough power. I had a deck of 30 power and 45 units, weapons and spells. I minimized power because I was getting too many in a row but still have the same problem"", ""I gave this 5 stars when I first started playing. But now its become a pay to win game. There are certain insanely overpowered cards that you can only acquire if you spend the money for expansions. Buy a bunch of copies of the same card and then just build your deck around those cards. If you're going to penalize players that are just looking for a fair fun free game at least make it so that they can spend shards on the premium versions of the card. Its a shame its always about the money."", 'Incredible game straight from the desktop. A worthy contender to magic the gathering. Links to a central account so you can play from your PC or phone.

I like how there are different ways to play, and that I can play for more coin even though I don\'t ""lose"" often.', ""I would give it 5 stars, however because of my screen set up I can't see my coin total so I'm never sure how much I have. But that's my only complaint, otherwise it's super fun and just the right amount of challenging."", 'Don\'t get me wrong. It\'s a great, fun game. I would totally recommend for my friends EXCEPT by the fact that the game is not free, but hidden behind a ""free game"" disguise. I really hate to download a game and after a few matches receive the message ""Surprise! The game\'s not free and you need to buy to continue playing!"". I love the game, but hate the marketing choice.', 'Amazing vector graphics and art style. Love it. Some of critique: Animations can be made shorter for the snappier feel of the gameplay.', ""Fun and enjoyable! I have played a few of his games and they don't dissapoint! Very unique and they do a great job explaining how to play. Awesome artwork. The creators and developers should be proud!"", ""A nice core concept, but lacks depth. Different monsters that have special effects (Can't be targeted by spells, can't be blocked by shields, etc.) would help add some depth to the otherwise basic number crunching. Additionally, you have no idea what RNG picks the game will give you for ability cards. Some, Shield Bash, can solo win an entire run, while others only serve to increase your score, and a few can even get you killed!"", ""Pretty good game, although I would prefer to know when a 'free' game is actually a demo for the paid game. Don't get me wrong, I am all for paid games when they are worth it, but prefer to know it before I download them. Aside from that, everything is awesome and enjoyable."", 'Fun game without worrying about running out of content. Completely worth the $5! The free version is just a taste of all the content that comes with the full version.', 'A very easy-to learn card-ish game, Card Crawl uses the theming of a dungeon crawler, and the limitations of a (modified) deck of cards to create a compelling game of risk and reward, where the pursuit of a high score means gambling on disposing of valuable resources. While the RNG will occasionally lead to impossible-to-win runs, the quick turnover from session to session, and steady progression of fun and brain-teasing card unlocks keeps the grind from feeling onerous. Highly recommended.', ""Game was excellent up until recently. Only issue that I'm having now is that the sounds and music have been replaced with a continuous robotic hum. This issue persisted through and uninstall and a reboot so it may be device specific. I'm using a OnePlus 7 Pro. If this issue is fixed rating will go back to 5*."", ""I want explanations for everything aside from the main gameplay, but even so, I'm hooked! It's quick, clever, and looks great. I love the art."", ""It's okay. Pro tip you'll have to take damage from high hitting monsters. None of the weapons (from what I've played so far) can slay 9 and 10 hp monsters in one hit. Take the damage from big monsters and use swords and shields to take out low hp monsters. Recommend keeping a high level potion in your backpack til the last 10 cards in the deck."", ""Very fun. It's not for RPG fans, but for fans of card games it will provide enjoyment in bursts of perfect length for a phone game."", ""Fun game. Sound is all digitized and can't listen to it. Have to mute everything. Update 12/23/19: still digitized, but not in Bluetooth mode."", ""I really enjoy the game but after a lot of hours spent on it I wish there was a little more to it, I've been trying to unlock the other two heroes but it's taking so damn long! Always playing with the regular knight can get a bit stale in the long run. But I really love the artwork and music and general feel of the game!"", 'Nice concept, easy to understand while also sometimes challenging If I had to say something negative about the game it would be that some ability cards seem fairly useless', 'Easy to play but fun enough to hold my interest. I like that there is unlimited gameplay without a bunch of ads.', 'Great game. Cheap for lots of additional content if you get bored.']"

Full patch notes: www.playhearthstone.com","[""Where do I start, I know how about the loading screen. You'll spend more time there than playing the actual game. Constantly being disconnected all the time, then having to restart the app just so it can happen again. Real fun, good times. This the third try I gave this game over the years, well no more. If you value your time don't bother."", 'Great game, truly. I have a lot of fun playing it even if a lot of people love to deride it. However, the Android app is absolutely awful. Seriously. Awful. It crashes sometimes I guess, but for the most part it just ends up unresponsive at loading screens. Like half the time that I open the app it hangs and I have to stop the process and open it again. It is incredibly frustrating. It also will have bizarre visual glitches at similar times, like corrupted NES stuff.', ""In short, this game is fun, but it does require some patience. The devs update the game a lot, but they are very slow when it comes to balancing the game. This is most prominent in modes other than the standard playmode. The wild format hasn't been balanced in months, with one strategy dominating the mode for over a year. The new battlegrounds playmode doesn't get much balancing often either. If you want to have fun, this game is good, but you will need to be patient to play competitively"", ""I've been playing HS since the first launch of the game. But lately the game keep updating something without any prompt, and apparently it disconnect the game, when i reconnect, i was considered lost to my last game. Happened so many times, and it's so frustrating (especially when doing Arena runs). Graphics glitches and game freeze many times since the last expansion update. One more thing, why it took so long to start the game? Is there nothing you can do to make it connect and load faster?"", 'Why is the galaxy note pen bug still a thing, 4 months after the patch that generated the issue?! I feel like there is 0 attention given to this. You acknowledged it only after a month since it started, on your forum; then in the only oficial update you gave you were stating that you guys reproduced it (like it was some realization, i mean just run the game on a galaxy note and try dragging a card), that it looks like an engine issue that takes a lot of time to fix, and that you investigate.', ""When moving from area with WiFi to 4g signal, the app has to close and reopen. Sometimes it doesn't register you've a game in progress until you hit 'play' and then resets again. By the time you make it back into game you've missed 1 or 2 turns making it pointless to continue. Otherwise, loving the new game mode."", 'I have been playing this game for many years now. As of this post, hearthstone is in one of the best places it has ever been. There are many modes to play and some that require zero collections. Conisder playing this game, it is by far the best card game on the store. It is not pay to win. Does it take time to build a good deck if you are F2P, it does but it not hard. I know numerous F2P players who have multiple viable decks.', 'This is by far the best rating on any game I have ever getting on a review. Blizzard\'s ""Hearthstone"" gets 5 Stars across the board for all the right reasons! The gameplay is fun and engaging, multiple heroes are very fairly balanced as well as the corresponding cards for each hero. Two says this game is pay-to-play would be unfair oh, of course like any other TCGit\'s going to cost money to buy booster packs, however I\'ve never purchased a booster and am a formidable opponent if I say so myself!', 'Like other reviews have said, the game hangs on the loading screen for awhile. Seems like they could spread that out a bit by not loading as much as soon as you start the game. Also, making it so that you can leave the app and come back without reopening the whole thing would be great.', ""I started playing this game since Whisper Of The Old Gods expansion which was in 2016 until now. This is the only mobile game that lasted for many years in my phone app. The down side is that Blizzard is a money hungry company which I notice how their expansion and card set became too expensive as the year goes by. They became too greedy with their sales. I used to buy cards before when it was in a good reasonable price. Now it's just ridiculously expensive."", ""I highly recommend this game, its my favourite card and that says alot, since i have play over 100 card games. Its simple, easy to learn great for beginners and new to card games. There is a new card set every 4 months and old sets rotate out every year, in standard there are 7 cards sets for 9 different classes and a basic set of cards everyone gets for free, earning in game money isn't to hard, of course you can choose to buy packs but its not necessary to play the game."", ""Tough to get started when you have basic cards and everyone has stacked decks with legendary everything but it's quite gracious with the amount of card packs it gives you early on. Also the crafting mechanic allows you to get some of the stronger cards without having rng in the way. Matchmaking is rough early on so 3 stars until noobs get matched with noobs"", 'Takes about a full year (maybe two) of playing daily (or every other day) before it really begins to feel like a ""free to play"" game. If you strategize over months, you can get a decent selection of cards to work with for free. Sometimes you trick people into letting you win but usually not. The solo adventures are pretty great. Highly addictive and extremely time consuming. Fun game!', ""Been playing since 2014 (basically since launch), and the continuous expansions and updates always keep the game feeling new. I was new to Blizzard games and didn't know about WoW characters or lore, but then I began playing WoW because Hearthstone made it so interesting. The port on mobile and tablets is also one of the best ports ever for a PC game. The only problem I have is there should be more hero portraits, Magni, Medivh and other heroes should come back to the store."", ""Overall this is a 5 star game, one of the best on mobile, but players are allowed to have strong and cheap decks from the start. These decks aren't those combo styled decks but just super agressive decks that most can't deal with. I just hope that the developers can ever so slightly improve the meta. This is supposed to be a strategic card game, not some no brainer agressive play style. Yes, its use of in game mechanic but it's extremely unskilled"", 'Pros: lots of modes, lots of cards, single and multiplayer modes,ladder system for some modes, warcraft themed Cons: the new player experience could be better, bad reward system. The overall cost of the game is high., no card trading. Some modes are to punishing to new players.', ""Love the game but... During solo play, I usually have no trouble reconnecting to games once the app has closed however it won't ever reconnect to boss fights, sometimes these fights can take 30 minutes or more to finish and I have to do them all in one go or it resets me back to the start of the battle, absolute nightmare for heroic mode"", ""New players must dump money into card pack to be able to compete. Card sets expire as new sets release meaning the grind never ends without real improvement. Other modes exist but 90% the same thing with slight changes, some locked behind paywalls also locking card sets out. One game mode is only worth playing until you win the free pack (which is a classic pack, you'll eventually just have all those cards and the pack is worthless) and one mode is an extremely poorly optimized beta."", ""Fantastic game that will keep you entettained for years. There's plenty of different game modes and characters/cards to suit your style of play. It rewards you for doing a good job and trying everyday with different quests. People complain that it costs money to play which sure thats a bummer but what great games are free?"", ""The AI cheats in solo play. I'm just a starting player but even on the easy challenges the AI is way too tough to beat. It's assumed that a good AI in the computer already can create perfect card ratios in the deck, will have better cards initially, and will calculate the best time to play any of those cards. But that is somehow not enough. The AI in addition will have many more copies than two of a cards, it will have more cards in their deck and more life. What the hell. This game is garbage."", ""I love this game but its super slow. The developers seem to have tried to update it so much and cram so much content in that it just takes an absolute age to load. It's almost unplayable. Sometimes i'll try to load it and give up after 5 minutes of waiting and play something else. It's such a shame because it's such a great game otherwise"", ""I'll be honest, I only started playing a few days ago. The only reason I'm even playing this game is because Gwent The Witcher Card Game has not been released on Android which I think is stupid because it's been on stupid iOS for months now. Anyway I don't like Blizzard Entertainment but I really wanted a CCG and not an Anime one so this is it till Gwent is finally released. I have Hearthstone on my iMac and, when I play this game I prefer the actual computer version."", 'The game was great but now they are doing just like Warcraft 3 Reforged. They put out a garbage expansion, which was just a money grab and completely unbalanced the game, so that you\'d have to pay for more cards to switch from the last ""best class"" which is now trash. Blizzard is just going downhill.', ""Great game, but buggy app. It's pretty frustrating that I have to constantly deal with the app freezing, crashing, and repeatedly disconnecting from the server. There is no excuse for this from a company that can definitely afford to fix it."", ""This app has so many problems. Aside from the obnoxiously long start up and reconnection times (assuming you are even able to reconnect to your game) it will also randomly disconnect you and/or black screen. Don't waste your money on arena. If you want to play this game do so on a pc."", 'Please for the love of god, fix optimization for android devices on Battlegrounds. It runs incredibly slow and laggy while every other game mode runs absolutely fine. The timer in the tavern is never consistent and every action is slow. Also, why does the desktop client get resolution and other graphic options to make the client run faster but android gets no such thing? Once again a Blizzard game falls flat cause of no simple quality of life changes. Other than this, good, addictive gameplay.', ""Easy to pick up and play compared to other card games but still very challenging. You don't need to have the latest cards to do well. Most of the cards are self-explanatory although you would have to research actions like inspire, rush, invoke, etc. It has recently improved alot. Newcomers to the genre will find it more enjoyable than the more complicated card games out there. Blizzard keeps it fresh with extra modes modes and campaigns to help keep it from being stale."", ""So many years Hearthstone cannot fix random crashes on Android phones especially on lower ranks. It requires relaunching all the time and reasons to crash could be anything, but network and memory are fine on my phone. This goes on for many months and occurs really often. Honestly, should be a shame it's not fixed yet."", ""One of the very few online games with a feelgood friendly atmosphere. I don't like that winning involves suffering probably to remind me that i dont pay-to-win and i also dont like that drama feels orchestrated (supposed to be cards drawn in random order but instead its cards in drama order) but i guess todays kids get bored when its otherwise. Anyways bravo and highly reccomended!"", 'I love the game, ive been playing it for a whyle and spent a lot of time in it but it frustrates me that after the last update i cant play it, the game ocasionally crashes every 1-3 minutes and leaves me unable to play anything, cant even create new decks cus i dont have enough t8me to save it before the game crashes, pls fix this blizzard, i tryed every posible way u recommended in help service', ""Very good game, recommend avoiding the battlegrounds mode on mobile phone since it's a very intense game for my device. But I been enjoying myself playing on multiple devices and love the highlander Shaman deck I been playing both in the standard and wild formats. Only complaint is that I'd wish crafting legendary cards were easier."", ""Definitely pay to win. For my first 3 years playing, I lived in casual and NEVER played ranked. If you are a beginner and f2p, you will never win ranked/get higher than rank 20. This is not an exaggeration. You will spend multiple years trying to save up coins/dust & never being able to use the good decks. I spent years stuck at rank 20 bc I didn't want to spend money, and 6 years later I finally give in and immediately get rank 11. Battlegrounds & Solo Adventure is finally making up for it tho"", ""Was a great game but now just crashes constantly before the load screen on a Lenovo yoga. Some sort of Java. Lang. Unsatisfiedlinkerror. Could be something related to processor. Be forewarned if your going to spend money and then can't access the game"", 'Really now, just when i thought they were being cool for giving us 100 gold 100 dust missions...they got greedy again and had to update and reduce the missions I ALREADY HAD by 40 each. All i do all day is get dominated by copycat ptw decks while desperatly grinding missions for my meager pittence so i can unlock another story mission, taking a week or more to get there. Real not really fun anymore. Thank god i never spent a dime on this trash.', ""Hearthstone's devs are greedy and they show no mercy towards newcomers. The only way to be f2p is if you started playing near the start. I would recommend checking out shadowverse if you aren't willing to spend money. The only way to win is by making a single meta deck with all of your dust and taking that to latter. The only downside is it gets boring to play the same decks over and over and over again."", ""Blizzard is bad at balancing Hearthstone's meta, in-game currency, and public relations. The first can be difficult to ask of any ccg creator, but Blizzard really does not like making changes to an online digital format where that would be only place to be able to do that regularly to a ccg. They have been trying lately, but have gotten very greedy with promotions. Honestly expect Hearthstone 2.0 from Blizzard this year or next year to invalidate this game. Do not invest into this game."", 'i think the app is good handles well great game. but when i play on pc when i go to launch it. it never launches. i dont know if this is a bug please fix it i enjoy your games blizzard but i will enjoy it more if you fixed this. plz fix and thank you.', ""After all these years y'all still haven't figured out how to match opponents worth a damn. A new player vs someone who has unlocked every card doesn't make me want to keep playing. Why would you not match based on level. Complete waste of space."", ""Very frustrated.. i can't log in to the game. It keep saying my session expired. What does that even mean? Even after downloading it again , still the BS. If i still can't play it in a few days. Im gonna quit all blizzard game for good .."", ""Server connectivity at an all time low, just now been trying to connect to a solo game with wifi and data for 47 minutes. App keeps rebooting. It's like that all the time though!""]"

I love the art. It does take a while to build good teams, and can be a bit overwhelming at first. The reason for this is that there is a lot of variety in play styles and team comps. But once you have some solid teams for farming and slightly harder game content, theres always more challenges in PvP. Put those thinking caps on, strategy matters in this game."", ""I've been playing this game for more than a year now. All I have to say is, if my account ever got reset/deleted I honestly wouldn't even be mad because I would just be able to everything all over again. Such as, the feeling of getting my first free 6 star or the feeling of accomplishment everytime my team's power rank goes up. Especially when I reached L rank. I just love this game."", ""Bunch of BS. Took about 1 hour 30 minutes to download data needed to start game and then once I download data it closes all my background running apps and when I login it tells me I need to choose a nickname, but keyboard doesn't work and a nickname is required to create my account. Don't download this if you wanna waste an hour of your time."", ""If you want a game where the Devs don't care about you then this game is for you, lackluster content, plagued with latency issues and overall terrible game balance, also worth mentioning there are roughly 250 players that the game devs don't care about which are every 2-4 star player in the game. In closing the only amazing thing about this game is how long it has lasted so far which as this review is 5 years..."", ""Super great game, and i have been playing it for 4-5 years, with some breaks on and off. But very good game, but only bad thing is that it crashes sometimes, but not as often as you'd think."", ""Why would you make a game that only crashes every time you want to download files. The game itself looks fun but if you can't even get past the download stage then it isn't worth the damn time you waste. Im friggn done with this sht. I'm going to search for a game that actually works!"", ""EXTREMELY pay to win. There are some skins you can't get without shelling out $100. Hard pass, pun intended. Minue the pay to win aspect, it's still a pretty fun game. (EDIT) They've gotten better at freebies and there's usually an event going on which is nixe, still salty about the $100 skins but oh well"", 'why this game downloading so SLOW!! 300mb additional data feels like downloading 2.5gb file. my connection is just fine in other game downloading 350mb++ didnt take more than 5 minute. in this game just 1% taking time more than 1 minute WTH!', 'A game worth putting time an effort in. Entertaing and so many v√°rios teams that you can make. I have played for two years and have not lost intrest.', ""Been playing global since server opened and tbh i'm happy with the game and how the devs have been making little positive changes all around over time, would recommend! *join global server best server*"", 'This is the only game that I played for years.

Summary of major new engine work completed in this new version:

4 years after the original release of Spades Free, we are happy to announce our single greatest improvement in play quality, after a prolonged period devoted just to Spades. This has always been a collaborative project shared with York University and has combined the best of AI research with game industry engineering to achieve the best result so far. In this last period particular attention was paid to bidding and the Nil game, but we also made substantial progress in the Joker variants and efficiency of the analysis. We believe that the end product was worth it. Discover the updated play for yourself!

We are looking to add more great features and game variants for Spades Free. Watch this space!

However, it needs the option to go back to zero points if you hit 100 points exactly at the end of a round.

The ads can be annoying, but that's the price of free play. The AI does not always play fairly or seemingly well but decent enough to give a challenge and make you want to come back to have another crack at it. The maker seems to be interested in improving their product, which makes me a fan."", 'The makers of this app are actively involved in clickjacking. Ads are displayed that you cannot close for 30 seconds without installing whatever they advertise. Ads that you do close continue to run in background, often with audio that you can\'t turn off. They play ads with audio even if you have the game itself muted, overriding settings. Gameplay isn\'t bad, but the rest overshadows it. **amended after vendor response** Perhaps ""clickjacking"" is too strong a word, even though when you try to hit the ""x"" in the corner of the full screen add it still takes you to the play store. Some of the ads even have fake ""x"" nuttons to entice you to click on them before the app-delayed ""x"" button is displayed. No other app I use on my phone plays audio ads when I have the app silenced. That fact that this one does (as do other games using this same engine) and that the vendor response is ""turn down media volume"" which has the effect of silencing other apps that I don\'t want silenced is not an acceptable answer. However, what is even less acceptable is that this app downloads and plays these ads in background WITHOUT DISPLAYING THEM TO THE USER. If it wasn\'t for the audio bug we wouldn\'t know that the ad was running in the background. So, instead of calling it ""clickjacking"" should we instead call it ""impression fraud""? After all, it is an incontrovertible fact that the ads are downloaded and run without displaying them to the user. It is troublesome that the vendor claims the app has no control over the audio of the ad - which would seem to verify that the app is downloading and executing code instead of displaying a banner. Again, that this is executing in background is a huge problem. Often after the ad is displayed the phone suddenly starts running sluggishly, even so far is disrupting animation in gameplay. So what is the ad doing that is so CPU intensive? Cryptomining perhaps? I realize that you don\'t have much control over the content of the ads, but you do have control over what ad networks you use.', 'Very entertaining when you have time on your hands']"

Summary of major new engine work completed in this new version:

4 years after the original release of Spades Free, we are happy to announce our single greatest improvement in play quality, after a prolonged period devoted just to Spades. This has always been a collaborative project shared with York University and has combined the best of AI research with game industry engineering to achieve the best result so far. In this last period particular attention was paid to bidding and the Nil game, but we also made substantial progress in the Joker variants and efficiency of the analysis. We believe that the end product was worth it. Discover the updated play for yourself!

I have tried different partners and difficulty levels but my win percentage is a little over 40 percent and the bad cards can get discouraging.', 'Well, playing this a lot, I have learned a bit about the patterns AI use. Sufficient to assume that both of your opponents can see your cards, but also know your partner can\'t. Secondly, your opponents will occasionally go into can\'t beat mode.

If I could give it no stars I would."", ""Beware...if a player leaves the game early, the computer will take over and get NO LESS than 5 the rest of the game. And guess where the chips go? Certainly not the players who stayed. Same thing in knockout and tournaments. I'm sure now after this review , my hands will go from 2 per hand to 1 üôÑ Greedy, cheating company for sure"", ""The bonus game always say wait 10 seconds when it says you have 30,000 coins when you try to look at the videos and never let you see it I think that you guys just need to fix that otherwise it's okay stange"", 'I have tried over and over to watch the video to get more coins & it tells me over & over wait 10 seconds. Wait 10 seconds.... tells me wait 10 seconds... never loads where I can watch the video for more coins', ""It's a good game but needs a few changes and upgrade in all. Funny i'm actually banned to play by other players why I dont know. That's why I wont spend a penny"", ""If your internet connection is good, great app but don't expect too many good players in low amount rooms. Lots of dummies playing"", 'All in all I like the game. There are a few things I can not stand. I do not l the CPU plays for you if you are not playing. It takes up allot of time and kills the game. It also feels like after you win so many games in a row it is sincered to where you will start losing. If you have a certain amount of coins you can not play the games worth smaller amounts. When you play with your friends it seems like you never win even tho you are a great player.', ""If I could give minus 5 stars I would! Game is full of cheaters that make 2 or more accounts and play at the same time at the same table, and even if you report it they don't do anything about it. When you are about to win you get lousy cards so that you can't even bid nil. I was playing this game for several years now and I'm sure of this what I am saying, it is time to say goodbye. Since Zynga took Spades plus it became unfair to decent players. Denying this would be offensive so don't. Thx."", ""Love the game..but I'm really pissed off cause it popped up saying watch ads 8x nd win 16000 nd sure enough I watch it over 3 nd 4 times nd never got paid out.it really sucks.Pay my 64000 or I'll delete the game"", 'you will have day of awesome hands every hand then 3 weeks of horrible hands every single hand. it sucks. They try and say cards are dealt off of an algorithm. The algorithm is you get decent hands for a day and then trash cards every single hand for weeks until you stop playing for a few weeks. Then when you get bored and try it again the cycle starts all over........ there are better spades games out there.', ""The app has become so buggy, it will take a chapter to go through all the problems. During play, the app doesn't go one person at a time. One persons play time will time down with nothing happening, the all of a sudden three player cards will appear on the board. When I win a book, my timer for the next play doesn't start. If I start to play a card, I get the warning that it's not my turn!. If/When the time starts, the app plays a card that I haven't selected. I just lost a game on the last play, that we had the winning score, because the app wouldn't let me play a card (kept getting the warning it wasn't my turn), then the game was over and I get a pop up message saying we lost the game because I wouldn't play a card for three rounds!!!!!!!"", 'Played a game earlier and won the first level but the game did not acknowledge that I won.
