As everyone else said, in the beginning you go up to £5 very quickly and then you get £0.10p a day which is fine! But the closer you get to £10(in my case £8.60) then you don't even get 10p a day. So if you want to pass time and you like spinning then download it but if you want to make money, even £10 then is a complete waste of time. Goodbye spin day."", ""I really don't know what rate I could give because based on my experience in playing this game it was really hard to get $10.. I was playing very hard to get the 5 million coins sometimes the game not yet responding when you get the bonus coins and impossible to get the jackpot. If there's a chance to win big I will rate this 5star to see if its possible to get the jackpot."", ""It takes a VERY LOOONG time to make it to just three dollars!!

Now five months down the line I have not had a 10p win. And as for the Five Million coins you collection to cash out for £5, I have worked it out I will get that in around a year. So all in all not a good game', ""So, I had cash symbols and it showed $1000, but I only had 10p credit. It's happened a few times since, and I've screenshot it as proof, never the winning amount of $1000 only 10p.

I used to get 20-30p every day to add to my withdrawal ammount. Also the tokens have been reduced massively. You would win on every 5 spins 2000-5000 tokens and now you get 100 for the angry face.

For the first two or three days you make about £2 per day which is encouraging, then it's less than 10p per day on average. You will spin 30+ per day and watch lots of ads.

It's a complete waste of time and a con."", ""Winning money stalled after the first several spins. Never have I landed on 3 symbols to win the cash prize either. I'm stuck on $3.70.

To accumulate 5,000,000 tokens will take you nigh on a full year. Payouts were large in the first week, after £5.00 the cash rewards drop to 10p. Been playing for over a week and had a few 10 pence payouts. Not once have I been close to a jackpot payout on all 12 slots x 5 spins. this is a marketing strategy for them to take the money you earn, after you stop playing after 90 days. Technical issues can void out cash payouts."", ""I've been playing this game for a good few months now. At the start it looked good, getting wins of 50c or 20c and got to €5 pretty quick but then it started to just win 10c every now and then. Now that I've finally reached €9 I can't win not even 10c. Just loads of ads. Total waste of time. You will never win the jackpot, not even the €5 one. And by the look of it you will never reach the €10 to be able to cash out."", ""I like what Viker does with these apps. Keeps it very simple. It's easy and enjoyable to play. Yes, there are ads, but they aren't cluttering up the entire screen or interrupting any action you try to take. Most of them also seem to not be terribly long maybe 5 or 15 seconds instead of the usual 30. I can't really speak to cashing out yet, but this game is designed so well I honestly just enjoy playing it. Eventually, I may win or accumulate enough money or points to cash out and will update."", ""Never hit the jackpot on the spins, just an occasional 10 to 25 cents. The closer you get to a payable amount (has to be at least 10 bucks), the less those payouts occur. All 3 Viker games I play show the same result. First you win often, then it seems to be capped so they don't have to pay up. You just spend time watching endless ads just to get to the 10 bucks so you didn't completely waste your time."", ""I just had two .10 cash earnings that didn't add onto my balance. I was enjoying this game till this happened. Now I'm seeing that it may be like the other games out there. Just junk to keep you watching ads and mess with winnings so you could never reach the goal. I don't understand why you people do this. If you say you're gonna give rewards than you should give the rewards. Every app out there seems to be junk excep the Lucky Time app. Thats the only one i found that works well. Disappointed"", ""Game is fun if you like one arm bandant. However very slowly paying so far. I have been playing about 3 days. It also takes a while to get games back. Took over 24 hours the first time and still waiting for games to reload and it's been all day from 5 am and now 8:30 pm. Believe if games would load faster it will be a little bit better."", 'DON\'T DOWNLOAD OF YOU VALUE YOUR TIME! It\'s designed so you win roughly £4 in one day and fast but it progressively gets harder to win any more money. You don\'t win 50p or 20p anymore. You just get 10p and that\'s VERY RARE for me, a masochist who spent ages accumulating £9 and I can\'t even cash out because you need £10. I do win ""coins""but you need 5 MILLION to cash out £5. How are we meant to get to 5 million!? I\'m only on 500,000 and I\'ve been playing for more than a week 3X a day. MINDNUMBING', 'Its an easy game to play....but like most of these apps, hard to actually win enough to cash out. Ive downloaded over 20 of these apps and play for a readonable time; usually between 2 weeks to 3 months and have only cashed out on 1 consistantly, Lucky Time. Although the jackpots make this game seems attainable, its not. Again, it shouldnt take you 3 months to cash out 10 dollars. Not reasonable nor logical.', ""Waste of time, I've been playing for 2 weeks. Quickly made it up to £5, then slowly adding 10p wins. Now at £8.60 and no wins at all. Its a scam, no one wins and they certainly won't let anyone get to £10 to cash out. Piss take. Avoid! I've made money with swagbucks and app station though."", ""Waste of time. They start you off with say 10 slot machines with 5 spins on each one. The first lot you win say... £4. Then the next time they refresh it'll be like 30p. Now I'm not getting anything. You'll never ever reach that £10. Seriously, don't waste your time and don't fall for all the big withdrawals from other players that will pop up. It'll be fake"", ""The adds for the game are STUPID!!! I only downloaded it because it said you could actually win 250 pounds but it is all a LIE you win a SMALL amount of money when you spin and it's almost impossible to get the jackpot I haven't got it. And it's not something you can play all the time you can play it until you use up all your spins and then have to wait ages until the spins our ready again DONT WAIST YOUR TIME BUYING IT!!!!!!!!!"", ""Should have read the remarks before i started playing - i started off getting 10c every so many games - after you get to a certain amount it slows up drastically - the last 2 days i've only won no more than 30c i'm at $8.60 - so how long are you ginna make me play ? The next 2 weeks to get $1.40 - if that happens i'm telling everybody on my FB not to ever play your games - it's FRUSTRATING & DEPRESSING"", ""you only need $10 to cash out I have been playing this game for the last month almost I'm stuck on $9 I'm constantly playing they won't even give me $0.10 a day you can't constantly play the game sometime I have to wait 13 hours before I can play again this game sucks the ads are always freezing or they're not working I never get close to winning the jackpot can't even win a $5 jackpot"", ""It's fun and what not I cant say anything about cashing out yet but I can say the process of earning coins take way to long you dont earn enough coins for sure need to add some more spin games where the jackpot is a certain amount of coins it would add more games pluss a chance to actually get some coins other then that though it's pretty good"", 'Pretty disappointing actually. It has 5.00 1 20.00 45.00 jack pots you can win. I get more fake coins than anythng and you have to have tons of them to even equal 5.00. I have been playng this game for several days and just hit the 4.00 amont. When you spin you only get .6 to .30 cents . make way more playing word games. Probaly will delete! and dont recommend. False advertisrments!', ""So far this game cheats. It keeps making itself stop if u win a few coins but the cash comes so close and nothing. Out of all the cards to win nothing just doesnt make sense. I'm gonna give it a few more tries but I'm not gonna waste my time on another app that gets paid from me watching the ads but pays out nothing. I mean 5.000.000 just to get $5 is crazy"", 'Scam!!!! Dont waste your time and data fir that. I spent last month playing variuos games from that company and stuck on £8.90 for 2 weeks!! No wins whatsoever, the algorithm just stops you from winning!!! I regret I have ever installed it and believed that I will get that voucher... they just want access to your phone and details!!!! Scammers!!!!!!', 'Dont waste your time with this app. You will be lucky to win 10p or 20p. Its all about watching ads. And to cash out its a minimum of £10.00p I think the developers hope you will play for awhile. Win a few pence and then delete because in that time you will have viewed loads of ads making them money and the player sod all.', ""It's ok but just like all the other games out there you mostly win coins and all these games say you win 50 100 1000 right away and all the games iv played I have not even got no were near that the most I have won on the games is 37 dollars and you need 50 to cash out and I been playing that game 4 months that's scratch day I have tried lucky night another game lucky night unstalled them all because they lie to you you never win the money 100 or more like they say you do"", 'Addicted no dout but wish u could actually win a jack pot almost impossible and kinda feel the game is rigged. Two different times i got three jackpots. One was the sushi and it glitched and gave me coins i stead of the money second time stopped then all of a sudden it moved one of the three down so idk might uninstall. Almost been a month i play twice a day and only at 5 dollars.', ""DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS STUPID APP I had downloaded this app and it keeps on hanging, so I had to uninstall it and reinstall it again and guess what my wallet balance was gone. I tried to connect with my facebook account but it never got connected. Also maximum time the money does not get added to my bank even after I won. I don't think I can ever make 10$ from the stupid app."", ""So far I haven't won any of the scratch off main prizes (shocker) but steadily climbing towards the ten dollar cash out. I just wish these sketchy apps actually did what they advertise in the incredibly annoying ads that pop up and entice someone into thinking you're going to win a lot of money, which is well known (we're all fools) you have to crawl and dig your way to *maybe possibly cashing out something legitimately. 3 stars because I'm skeptical."", 'Developer is so mean with the token like the highest i got maybe 2000-2500 but it is so rare. It will take ages to reach 5 mil token. In another game i can get 5 mils in around 2 weeks and so far i have earned $12 from just tokens. I give up playing this spin royale cause it just wastes my time unless you fix that token reward then i will NEVER recommend this game to anyone', 'Been playing for almost a year now and never won a jackpot until today, says I won £60 on one and £20 on another but both times when I clicked to add it to my bank, the money did not go through, and has not been added to my total', ""No deposit required it loads up free games to spin every few hours . Only annoying thing is the 5 second advert every 2 games that you play but I can live with it. I've only been playing less than a day and already at £5 but ya can only cash out to PayPal when you've £10, love it so far!"", ""Please don't download this app! It will give money for two new slot of spins only! After that it won't give you a single cent of money! Now i have 5 dollars,but having 10 dollars will allowed you to withdraw. But i still playing for two days, I can't get a single cent. Still remains only in 5 dollars."", ""Unlike other games that give you free money at the start to keep you interested I've been playing this for a while now and I am still seeing steady amounts of money. It's a definite download as it takes only 2-5 mins to do all your spins and you get free money."", ""Waste of time. You can't reach to £10 in a year. Tokens you will hardly manage to 5m in next 6 months or so. If you have 6 months time to get £5, then this app is for you. Cheers!!!"", ""This game is a fix don't bother playing it twice I won money the biggest one was £35 and it disappeared apparently they say it's a bug again which is lies they refuse to let u win a jackpot offered me tokens I refused the tokens they did not pay me my £35 which was won fair and square"", ""I wish I could give it -5 stars after the last round of scratching. I actually won on one if the 5.00 CARDS but actually sat here and watched the middle symbol move down one after the wheel stopped thereby making it a loser. THAT to me proves that it's nothing more that a RIGGED fake GAME. Instead of paying actors to portray WINNERS show REAL WINNERS instead. Oh sorry you can't cos there are no WINNERS are there"", ""I don't like to rate an app right after I begin using it. I've done this before and regretted it after a month or so but I believe this app will live up to its current play time. It's fun and easy and it has paid out in the short time I've used it. Hope it keeps working smooth!"", 'Easy and simple game. Only reason for such a low rating is the incredibly long launching of the game. It just hangs there at 0% for minutes! Incredibly infuriating. Even after reopening the app, same problem occurs.', 'For me just a wastage of time. For 50 spins, i get 10 cents.

Don't waste your time playing"", ""I've been playing for 2 weeks now I do lot of reviewing for games like this and is by far the worst withdrawal % on money games I spoken to to many people who have not won anything will keep everyone updated as at the mo have over 2000 people testing these sort of games"", 'It is fun to spin the cylinder and get money or tokens. Somedays are great and somedays are not. But on the whole winning seems to be more than lossing. It is a fun way to measure out the spins for a day or a time on the game.', ""2nd comment. In my conclusion, dont install. Your wasting time while they earned cash from your action watching ads. You'll never reach £10 in a matter of days, or never will. Just an advice.

I do forgot some of my bad days. And I really feel comportable.. it so amazing to be playing with this games. And also do share it with some of my friends in and out of this country.. and there feed back is good. I really love it"", 'I like the games but it takes long time to collect free coins. Today, 02/18, I did the up dates. It said that this my not be opptimal for my device. So I guess I will have to see if it lets me play or I will have to delete the game. I find this is the way of most of the casino games. I have been unable to play several and had to delete. Not happy, and I do not want to go buy a new device to play.', ""Awesome games u see in brick n mortor casino!! App runs and loads flawlessly on my galaxy s9 👍 BUT...... not sure what world they're living in charging $2.99 for 150,000 coins!!!?? Lol seriously ppl 🙆\u200d♂️ most games have a 20,000 min bet (few are low as 6k) I mean thats only like 15-40 spins for 3 dollars ( if u dont win )😟 truly ridiculous entertainment value since it can be gone in minutes! Would be my fave casino app 5 stars otherwise! (Daily bonus and free chips are cheap too )"", 'Good luck getting any chips to play with. Coins that would last you less than a minute on a minumum bet for 3 dollar coin package, less than 10 with a whopping 10 dollar package of a pitiful 900,000 coins. That means jack nothing in this game. DAILY SPIN IS THE WORST THING. YOU GET ENOUGH FOR MAYBE 5 SPINS EVERY DAY. Good games, horrible horrible coin system period.', 'I havent played this game in a while.....only had 8,000 coins too play...i guess from my last time.....2 mil....i didnt get too play.....great game...ran out of coins within 1 min.....o my goodness then here comes the money ads....my thing is that when aplayer stop and come back....2 mil should be there too play....thats what your ad say....Its FREE....so why should i or anyone else purchase coins?', 'Used to enjoy playing this game until the new Collections Adventures event started. Now every 3rd spin or so you get an annoying invasive popup inviting me to purchase these ""special deals"". We get it. There\'s an event on. But the constant interruptions and in your face notifications have ruined the experience for me.', 'I have never won a major jackpot on this app. The bonus coin is not an incentive but a waste of time and annoying popping up constantly. .nothing is gained from bonus. The hourly bonus and wheel spin needs to be increased...you wait an hour for a mere 30k and 24 hrs for wheel spin and win even less and bonus coins for 4k or 5k when the minimum game bet is 10k...come on guys.', ""You don't give enough coins to play. It takes 10,000 to spin and you give 30,000. You can't play..... I gave it a try for a few days but I spin for three spins and that's it.... Sorry just not much entertainment, have to uninstall☹"", 'For the most part I enjoy playing this app. I have about 5 games that I like. Then there are days like this past week where EVERY single spin is a losing one and I lose all my coins.', 'Love the games but this is the cheapest game given money out on the wheel and collect when you first go on the app. I hope this new version is better so I can change my opinion.', 'Love hov but dont get many bonuses and even when i buy coins they never seem to last long. Also the free spin hardly ever pays enough to even play.Everyone tells me to play others that dont cost as much but i reallylike this game the best,', ""Big Win animations appear and then you hit 0. Bonus games have a 1/10,000 chance to hit, and even when it says you've won millions, it only pays you about 5 digits. Avoid this broken mess!"", ""This is the biggest rip off I've ever played. Not one win or bonus. The chips are over priced and it's fake money for crying out loud. I would recommend playing with real money at the casino than this. Ya win more believe it or not."", ""Really sucks you force an update then game won't work or load. If you are going to change things get it right first. I've tried to get it loaded 3 times since your update always errors. Get your s___ together!"", 'Your games are great but far too expensive by the time. I convert them to Australian currency and your Las Vegas feature is just ridiculous to gain the amount you need to roll a dice you will lose a lot of fans if you dont lower your prices thank you', 'No way to get extra money. Bonuses are far and few between and no way to get extra money unless u buy and I am not going to do that. It takes the fun out of the games. Have not played in a long time.', 'Love the games.

I got 12 policemen and betting 2.5 million and no win and the screen is locked up ? Not Happy right now ."", ""Minute of fun... not really. The daily bonus is worth a few spins, good luck getting any bonuses. The payback rate is horrible, I've noticed in other reviews people mention this and Heats of Vegas responds with we are just like a real casino with odds of winning/payouts being just like a real casino, that's a bunch of lies. Machines are w WAY too tight! Find another game that actually lets you play, Heats of Vegas will only disappoint you!"", ""I love playing your games in an actual casino. However, it's obvious you are WAY behind other apps. The daily bonuses, hourly bonuses and free coins from your fan pages on Facebook are all a complete joke. All said and done, you get to play for maybe 5 minutes a day. I've stuck with this app for way too long...uninstalling until you figure out how to create an app that is enjoyable to play."", ""I like the slots very good selection but you guys don't give enough free coins and I make a lot of purchases ."", ""Games are great, but these games are suppose to be fun to play. It's hard to get the free spins. I feel like I'm really at the casinos, especially the Tarzan game. I had 12 million and finally got the free spins when I had 1 million left. Smh! We are not winning money so please loosen the games. Thanks."", ""I fell in love with this App almost instantly. The games are clever, easy to follow and fun for all ages. The only issue I have is I had to log out for a day to get some work done and my account was erased without so much as an email or text. It broke my heart, this was my all time favorite App and I invested a large amount of money in it because I adored it so much. Don't give up hope on your faithful customers, I would have been a customer for life."", ""A lot of good games but usually can't play for very long because you don't get enough coins."", 'A heart of Vegas app will not load.

I enjoy playing slot games.', 'Quit playing about six months ago, as the game just flat stopped paying any winners. It literally NEVER won more than a break even pay. I reinstalled upon the advertisement of a ""welcome back"" of 10 million chips. Took an hour to reinstall, and never received it. Will never again install, and definitely wouldn\'t recommend.', 'I really love this game.... but its almost impossible to win enough coins to keep playing..not only is the daily spin amounts crazy low, you hardly ever hit a big win & in order to hit a big enough win to be able to play longer than a day you have to buy coins that are super expensive..the daily bonus wheel is horrible the most coins you can win from the bonus spin is 2,500 coins.if you happen to hit the ""biggest"" number you can maybe spin 20 times but youll have to bet the less amount possible', ""I've had a great experience with the Buffalo game it's very exciting at times especially when you are winning."", ""I only gave one star even though I love this app but it hasn't worked on any of my 4 devices since yesterday Jan 30 I have been playing it for a long time. It keeps telling me something wrong with game reinstall and I did but it still doesn't work, gives same message on all 4 devices.

There is NO customer service phone number, and you have to take a screenshot of EVERY SINGLE THING you do otherwise they basically call you a liar. It takes up to 24 hours for them to respond, but if I dont answer within a few minutes they close the ticket. Want to make it right, dont be so greedy', ""Love the fact it is a fun game. I like the daily challenges and tournaments offered. Do not like when the game shuts down during my free spins. I give the customer service a 0!

Now they have made it so in order to progress anywhere or complete the daily challenge you have to spend a minimum of $20 it is a RIP off. I was asked for my feedback before on this and many other things and instead if listening to their players they added more fluff while making the game harder to win.

The Scatter Slots Team","[""This game at first look is awesome, great graphics, great interactive play, overall a good slot, with one major unfortunate exception!! The expected bet to win ratio is pathetic. Unless you plan on paying a fair sum of real cash to have an hour or so of continuous play, don't waste your precious data downloading and playing this game. I've given this game a fair try and I am greatly disappointed, considering the potential this game offers. That is why my rating changed from a 4 to a 1."", ""Typical pay to play like all the rest. Some levels take months to pass. But excellent graphics and entertaining. Update. Ridiculous... payouts have quit, levels have gotten stupid. You have no chance to pass unless you pay. Plus you can't play until you have an average of 7 pop ups every time you want to play. I did love this game but they ruined it. At best... Use it for a quick fix then move on."", 'This is a VERY entertaining, intriguing game. The graphics are fantastic. There are so many different ways to win, so many daily and hourly events, games to win. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE this game. I had it 2 phones ago and am so glad I found it again. I deleted 4 games from my phone because I knew I would be playing this game more!!! Thank You Murka for making this game and for making fun & addicting!!', 'its a slot machine game. there isnt really anything special about it, but the problem with this game is how desperate they are to get in your wallet. several pop ups offering different various ways to spend your real money and in ways that if youre clicking to fast you will accidently click on one and potentially spend real money by accident. each day you sign in you will be flooded by these annoying micro transaction pop ups to the point you will finally uninstall the game.', 'The graphics are amazing. But you cant get past level 25 because the game does not give you enough money. You can spend hours gathering your money for it to be gone in a matter of minutes with nothing to show for it. Edit: also, I never got my bonus for a comment (probably because I gave 1 star.) And you need to sort out your free spins. I got 50 free spins. The first 7 were hit and miss then for the last 43 I got absolutely NOTHING!', ""This game used to have better support. It frequently gives errors on purchases, which wasn't a problem until recently getting credits for. Now it seems the customer service is lacking. Great game, but don't waste your money on purchases or they will just steal your money and tell you everything is okay"", ""Great game. Definitely a challenge to clear some level. The pop-ups are annoying, the long streaks of no winning are disheartening. The glitches are terrible from a gaming Development stand point. But the saddest part is the auto robot responses from their support team he doesn't seem to care what the consumer says. It's easier to just pop out an auto response and tell you best of luck next time. Way to go way to keep your consumers happy."", 'Well at first it was a great game now, not so much. I was playing in spider queen Betting 50 million at a time the game messed up and they sent me lottery tickets which was a COMPLETE JOKE...GOT NOTHING...the same thing happened and of. Course sent screenshot and there working to fix it??? Give me a break..and customer service is HORRIBLE save ur money and time...WOULD NOT recommend this game', 'Thia is one of the worst slot apps I have ever played. You will win a ton within the first few hours of downloading the game but after that be prepared for constant loss. I have spent roughly $6 each time I play and I lose my coins with in minutes. This game is a rip off. Think twice before downloading.', ""I had installed this app in Dec. I got so far in levels that I stop keeping track. Next thing you know it said I needed to update the app so I did. The first time I ran the app after the update the froze and I couldn't play, I had to go to settings to clear the cache because the game wouldn't load up after I cleared the cache I got to play the game one more time. After that the game never loaded past 25% after that. I kinda hope that it would keep my progress. Sucks lost all progress."", ""Having a great time with the game. It is more than Slots, it's a Master Puzzle pieces to get to the Grand Scatter Slots. Love the graphics. Someone has spent alot of time to develop this. Thank You very much! This game just keeps getting better. The New Slots are very exciting. I am looking forward for all the best way to spend some free time. Thanks again for your response and game. And I keep looking forward to finding out what's around the corner every time I open the game."", 'I have downloaded this game 2 times over the past couple of years. I ""have got to know it"" as murka replies to every bad rating. The lines you have to hit to get a push on your bet is ridiculous. They say it is free to play, but your free coins will average you about 2.5 minutes of play time an hour especially if you bet up to get the bonuses. When you do buy coins it drinks them like water. If I want to buy $100 worth of coins that pops up, I will go a real casino and play for real money', ""It's not worth spending money on. I bought a Google Play card and bought a month worth of daily bonuses. Well my good phone got watered And I had to go back to this old phone. Same account same phone number and they can't Do anything about it? I have to do something. Personally, I don't believe them when they say they can contact Google Play And verify it. Folks don't spend any money on a company that can't be bothered to back you when something goes awry"", ""How is it I spent 75million, and didnt get a bonus or win? Rigged to take your coins, in hopes you spend real money to get more. I just uninstall, and move to another slots game. And also, why when the 2X or 3X Booster is activated, you don't win anything. So, you guys keep track of those who real money and those that dont."", ""I've upgraded to Level 10 symbols and it's still paying out the same amount it did when I first started playing it !!! Yeeaahh.. Up until now i was thinking it was a great game... But now I feel all my TIME HAS JUST BEEN WASTED. Thinking about deleting.. Some Free coins would be good."", ""The game has amazing graphics and is fun to play, BUT It is focused on you spending real money. In the end they take your money like every casino. If you know that up front, then you'll enjoy it. They really programmed a GORGEOUS game & have VERY talented graphic artists. I got to level 103 and can't go further unless I spend real money. It's still fun regardless. One big plus is the free coins from Facebook every day. That helps in the beginning. ☺️"", ""I'm done with this game. I've been playing it for several years now, but it has become unplayable for me because I am so sick and tired of all of these screens and mini games that I have to get through before I can actually play the game. So goodbye Murka Games, goodbye Scatter Slots, you're being deleted."", 'This game used to be the best. Now it is the slowest game in history to load to even try to play. When and if it does load it is slowed down even more by their greedy side games to try and make more money from everyone. This game was ruined by greed and is not worth downloading.', 'What have you done to this game since update. No wins, no bonus or free spins. If you think I will just sit here and watch spin after spin with no win(a win being more than your stake) then you are mistaken. You only get 2 stars for the graphics...... Following on from Murkas bot usual response warrants a further reduction of a star. It has nothing to do with luck or self belief thanks very much. Thank god I have never bought a coin pack.', ""So I started playing this game because I like to have fun and I am now on level 29. I admit at first it was really fun but then now it's to the point where you need to decide whether you're going to stop having fun and not spend money or spend money to continue having fun unfortunately the designers of this game will not allow you to do both.I just now got my hourly allotment of coins and was able to spin a total of 18 times on the lowest bet."", 'Frustrating and anoying but still play and glad its at lease free. Now that I mentioned this, now you cut me off so I can not play at all. WHAT KIND OF SCAM ARE YOU RUNNING? If you paid me, instead of me paying you to screw me while your controls work at your demand. Do not really beleive what you have done considering I only told the truth to you.', ""This was a real adventurous. Never had this type of feeling while playing slots real anxious but nervous with a bit of excitement. And when the jackpot payout it's an amazing feeling good sound and very good quality graphics. Kudos to you Merica for developing such an electrifing gaming experience..."", 'Ive had to reduce my rating down to 3 stars. I purchased the premium Liberty Rush event and had 2 days left to complete the feature, when i realised that the Scattered Tournament, which is linked to the liberty rush i purchased, was no longer available even tho i still had 2 days left in the event. I contacted support and to their credit respond quickly and tp my understanding tryed there best to assist me, after following the devs instructions, uninstalling twice, was unsuccessful.8', ""This game has gone down hill over the past year. Bonus games hit less often, and free spins are much harder to get. It's not fun if you don't or can't win!! The new owners/administrators have killed this once fun game, and I'm deleting it!!"", ""Love this game, very addicted to it. But.... I have been playing for the last several days repeatedly spending all my credits. My bets ranging from 100,000 to 25,000,000 without a single card for the side game! Not one! What's the deal?"", ""Not bad. Yes graphics are great especially if you love the fantasy realm like I do. However after nearly 30 days being VIP customer you don't stay in front with coins. Have not spent a cent on the Slotventures game am in the billions, same with Game of Thrones reels. Not convinced that I just unlucky with this game. Pity I liked this game but headed to an uninstall at this stage."", 'Eh... I dont know what to think, really. Sure ive been playing this for an hour and i have 1.5B or so ""coins"". My main issue is that the writing is too small. Yes, im getting old. But, still... Oh! And i dont get why this game is marked 18+ and advertises that its a sexy and/or sensual experience. I really wasnt expecting a porno. But i wasnt expecting there to be nothing, except for a couple anime stills. As well drawn as they are, you would expect to see some movement.', 'Well have a blast playing still alot of bugs to workout win big pots but dont get credit .The high roller games impossable to play.Lost 200 million in 2 min took months for me to win enough credits to even try wont do that again ever But love the girls very sexy dancing blade so far gets my vote Im on level 66 took 3 months to get there', ""Inconsistencies, changing rules (rules are not specified), with player's knowledge, Glitches, they apologize many times. Free game, and fun when it is working properly. Great graphics, usually. Support is hit and miss."", 'It started out as realky fun but then they put goals out there thet are so outrageous that it is taking me 5 days to completr this one and yhe last onr took 4. I still havent completed this one. I keep running out of money and im not moving up in my % at all. Im not good with this game anymore!😢😢😢', 'Great graphics and game play but there are times where the different tasks make it extremely difficult knowing the last event it was simple to get things and you pick that slot for the next event because of previous stages and then your sitting there for awhile.', 'Amazing graphics, huge winnings, lots of different types of slots and ways to win plus so many bonus and extra spin features! Yes the losses can be huge as well but its the luck of the draw and theres always a daily bonus and other ways to get free coins!', 'Very discouraged with puzzle pieces that are won have SO many duplicates in a row not allowing me to complete the puzzle for more credits. Seems kind of fishy.I am not buying any more points for this game, but I will be patient enough to wait for hourly bonuses.', ""because it's too slow takes freaking forever to go from one game to the next. it keeps changing bk to home & you never really get a rhythm The payout on the joker game is ridiculousthere's no way you could ever hit the jackpot you can't get all the candles lit it doesn't have the oddsand try to get free spins or bonus games. you need to rewrite the algorithm so when you get more than one match of any three symbols you should get a lit candle for each match"", 'I really like this game but i havent bought coins, level 110 and im sick of struggling for many days with no coins, living off the hourly bonus just to get to the next level?. Then you load me up again with a chest?, Then you take it all back and leave me poor again struggling???, Dont like it.', 'Games were fun, exciting, all different and challenging . But the challenging rounds suck up your money fast. It was fun and entertaining for two hours authenticating anything. Do individual spins and you could go all day.', 'I have been playing this game 1 year or more.i have spent over $1000.00 dollars I was on level 144. Around 5 days ago the game crashed they put me back 100 levels.refuse to put me back to my original level.who ever put me back on level 44 they missed the 1 in front.dont spend money on murka games.', ""Graphics are PHENOMENAL! And that's to say the least! Hats off to the Graphic Department , cause You Need a 👑! I also Love the slots w/challenges to unlock the next . Whoever came up with this needs a BIG Raise! These are the most entertaining I have ever had the privilege to play, and I'm not just saying that. Every1 who is behind the making and maintaining of this game THANK YOU ALL, Awesome Job!! I don't normally do this but Highly recommend this game to all Adults!! 💯% Approval !!!!!"", ""This gme is very interesting, I very glad that I downloaded it. Normally I wouldn't have because I was never into thins like this but now that I have had a chance I like it very much.I would definitely tell my friends about it.I Recommend this game to everyone they should not be closed minded as I was before playing it so try it wht do ou have to loose. Expand your minds we all need to try something new today."", ""I got to see some really cool graphics and fun to play... I'm ADHD and it holds my attention!!! I think I could love it forever. I'm addicted!!! 😘 I still can't get enough... Even though for some reason I got completely restarted...""]"

I've been waiting a long time to move up in the VIP rm. But years later I'm still not past the gold level.

It really sucks to think after all the year's I'm ready to give it up"", ""The new update completely sucks. You can only send 20 gifts. What's the point of having 100 friends? They didn't get much in the first place. The huge tiles for gift spins suck and you can't delete any so you need to scroll past maybe 20 or 30 to get to the one you want to play. Leave a good thing as is. Just another needless update and they made it cheaper for THEM."", 'Obvious ad watching setup. Constantly lose everything even at lower than reasonable bets so that you have to watch ad to get coins again. This gos on and on until you cant watch ads anymore and the shop pops up.

I will update this in the future, hoping rewards get better."", 'Holy, talk about rigging the winning outcomes. This game is a major money grab. How much you can win is decided by the devs. After you win the total amount set by devs, no mater how much you try u will lose, until the cooldown is reset. I went from 800mil chips to 0. Yh thats how bad this game is and my bets were like 1 - 2 million ones not 30-40. imagine spnding mony jst to find out devs have limit in backend which is a majr fraud.

Then you press perfectly on a winning combination but the reels keep spinning until the winning combination has passed. There is no real randomness to this game.."", ""I like it so far...clear features and goals. Just a few days into it though. Had an update last night and one feature I'm not liking so far is the reward coin total area no longer says if it's locked or not...I got locked yesterday when I hit the daily limit and though it doesn't seem locked still, none are being added. Very confusing and no time is given on when it will open again."", 'Fun and entertaining. Also, a great way to win free stuff for your next trip to Vegas!

You need to fix it so that we can start receiving our gifts', 'After the update you would be better off just going to a real casino. No point in playing this game anymore.

The rewards have gotten to the point where it makes it no longer worth it to play. I'm a vegas local and the Station Casinoa rewards used to make it worth it. I have spent money on this app and can't even use most the rewards and the ones we can use are expensive. Also, the longer you play, the tighter it gets so you have to spend money on chips.

Edit after response from Playtika UK: I have noticed an uptick in higher bonuses, which is helpful. I still find that the challenges are only winnable with purchases due to high qualifying bets. The higher dollar amount bonuses are nice though.', ""It's a very fun way to spend down time. The graphics are outstanding. Love the contest and payouts. Reasonable rates on purchases.Still having fun, you should give it a try. It has so many different games you should be able to find something you love too. Great start today 65 free games for 195,000 coins can't beat that. If they had 20 stars that's what I would give them. Frog game, love it. So not to long ago on one of the games I started winning big ended with 47 million. So I'm telling you I."", ""It's a good time passer. RNG in games is great. Free coins low, but spins and random gifts are superb. Free 100 spins, 20 a day? Doesn't work properly, 60 spins in 5 days so far. BUY COINS everywhere. Four buttons for it in main menu only. Every time you go to the menu, pop-up asks for money. No two step verification for purchase, straight away it prompts your CC. Misstapped? How sad. They fixed some issues in my first review, so kudos and higher rating from me."", ""Impossible to win and/or retain points. Side games like the 'Trip' are as exciting as watching paint dry....you would think you were going to win billions of points...but it's so little that it's not even worth playing!! BORING!!! Feb 2020..It's gotten worse!! Nothing but pop ups and coupons and gimmicks to get you to buy!! Inbox shows 9 items to collect when really there were 2 minimal amounts of coin to collect...the rest are Buy, Buy, Buy!! Time to uninstall !!"", ""So far so good. Just got app yesterday and got no bonuses, scatters, nothing. So played for about 20 mins and was broke. Today...different story. Lots of wins and will have some fun. I'm not asking for everything free. I get how you make money. Just I went broke so fast didn't have time to figure out if I liked it."", ""I'm not a huge 'slots' fan but I don't mind playing a few spins here & there on 'HOF'. Pros: • Variety of slots to play. • Variety of 'mini' reward games. • Unlike some other slots, there's NO creeps trying to add you as a friend! • Reward links via FB & email. Cons: • Takes FOREVER to get balance built back up once it gets low.... it's annoying as I will NOT spend real money on any slot game! • Some in-game mini games require minimum bet to participate. Pointless playing them otherwise!"", ""when i first started playing this app i would have given it 5☆after several updates for the app now when i load it, it some times takes ages for the game to load, when playing a game it will suddenly stop then takes ages to load again or you have to close the app. winning minor, major or grand prizes in any game i've noticed they've become less and less and few and far between. i also think it should be the player who decides how much to bet per game and not you raising the minium bet to play."", ""Awesome, fun for the whole family. Great entertainment. Great games!!!!!Playing everyday. Great!!! Can't put the phonedown. Wonderful!!! what an experience $$$ Marvelous, having a great time. The games are always changing for the best. I am enjoying it at all times of the day. Games continue to entertain and amuse. Definitely 6 stars.keeps getting better & better"", ""Too many pop ups. Mobile is better than web version but not by much. There's even a pop up telling me the previous challenge has ended, and that lasted an entire week. Good variety of games but most very tight. Very hard to find one you can play on without losing quickly. Lots of fun challenges but most too long and too difficult, and most come with multiple pop ups every time you load site. Too frustrating to enjoy."", 'Its ok. There ""Big win"" is usually only equal to 10 spins. And then they want you to update your review. And it constantly pops up saying you should increase your bit. And if you want any of the other stuff going on like cards or trophies . . . . Well the amount to play is WAY to much. They pretty much have it set-up so you get 5 mins of free play. Anything more than that cost. Sorry but I\'m not going to pay for fake money. We have real casinos for that. Same still', ""HOF games are fun but I'm not enjoying it much as I did when I first began playing HOF. I play the Daily Rush game, the challenge, it is in 3 stages. The first one is fine but HOF doesn't tell us how to play the 2nd one which I never completed. I've tried writing support twice but never heard back from them. House of Fun, please be kind to those who play the game."", ""Listen I would be lying to say I am not going to play on HOF, but I don't like the fact that once you get so far in the challenges they have the present box and completed stages come up and you can't finish the whole challenge there is always one stage or card or store you get far really far and spend the rest of your time trying to get that one thing. Come on guys make it fair ."", ""I like it we'll. The games are interesting. Plus, I like that I'm able to make extra coins by watching videos. The extra activity on the side like the genie one. Gives me the desire to keep spinning. So you go guys. Still Loving it. You deserve my rate yet again. Keep up the good work. One thing tho. I made a mistake saving the coins in the bank. Cannot see anything without my👓. I really don't want to spend money to get it out. Bummer out.😞"", 'Out of all the slot games ive played, this one is definitely one of the worst. I playes every single slot that was availible to me, and from that I can say the payouts in this game are ridiculously low. I hit the whole board, and only got enough to spin like 6 more time? Really? ""Big Win"" literally means nothing in this game, you dont get enough to do anything, and thanks to that even if you\'re on a winning streak you\'re still losing way more chips than you\'re making.', ""great! lots of fun!!! MY favorite game! Love the graffics ! I play all day till I run out of coins! I know it is a game of chance but the coins aren't enough to keep playing. I'm upset that some games I worked to unlock are locked now why? I don't think that is fair.I'm still gonna play till I'm broke!"", 'I am writing another review with an update. It seems like no matter how much money you spend you cannot get ahead in this game and it is a waste of money.there are times that you can go on major win streaks but they are very far and few between and since I am in such a high my qualifying bets are so high for the in-game challenges that it makes it impossible to keep any amount of. I am on level 1680 and the qualifying bet for every in-game challenge is well over a million coins.', ""Fun! Fun! Fun! A lot of different games to choose from. Some of the games have goofy names or silly music but they bring the fun. Oh! Loyalty is rewarded. HofF is my new favorite game. Thanks, HofF! Good job on the updates, and terrific problem solving. I can't recall the last time I had customer service send a message telling me what happened. Wow! That's about all I can say... Wow! I'm a fan!"", ""best games! play every day! love HOF but wish the collections were more as the betting amounts are too high for the money you get every three hours. I only get a few spins and then have a long wait for more. we can't all afford to buy! Still enjoy playing and free coins have been increased somewhat! Four stars now! would like to give five stars but everytime I win big its taken straight back.cant always be just bad luck!"", ""I've been playing for over 3 months usually daily. Great games, I got started with a free 1,000 and I have not had to buy anything. I just keep collecting the free points and I win enough to keep playing. I bet low maybe that's why I never have to buy anything and I haven't had any issues collecting anything. The only downside is that they lock up the games I like and I can't figure out if you have to pay to play them again or not but I can usually find another one I like."", ""I've been playing this game now for longer than I can remember and it's still as enjoyable all these many, many, many months later as it was when I first downloaded it and started playing. There's always something cool and rewarding everyday they're posting (i.e. coins and prizes) to collect daily. Love this game a lot more than some of the others I've played 😎😆😉"", ""Win % is horrible One would think to keep one interested bonus games with be easier to hit. 2/18/20 Update: i wouldn't spend 1 cents on app. The gummy slot, i must of spun over a thousand times already and not 1 time got the bonus wheel, not once. And almost every spin 2 wheels come up, never the third. And the reply from my first review is ridiculous. Like id post a review off 1 or 2 games. In fact i dont give reviews unless extremely good or horribly bad."", ""Downloaded as part of an offer wall. It's part casino and part mini games. Instead of just virtual currency, you also win assorted prizes toward mini games, that then pay out in game currency. By restricting your winnings they hope you'll spend actual money. You can earn free coins daily but it will take forever to earn the reward the offerwall made in the first place. If you just want a casino game, there are better ones out there. As a random distraction, this is fun enough."", ""Just started to kill some time lost all my chips super fast with in minutes so game didn't kill much of my free time I had. Maybe I was really unlucky or it's set up for you to lose fast either way you start with next to nothing for chips to try out the site. Unless your willing to spend cash on a site before you even know if you like it. I'm for one not willing to. Lucky there are lots of different sites these days so I will try a different one and hope it's better."", ""Very challenging slots very entertaining each slot is an Adventure. Never a dual moment with HOF. I find myself so entertained at times that I don't even realize that hours have gone by. For many hours of great fun House of Fun is the way to go! Fantastic fun. But once you start prepared to be addicted to the fun.!!!!!!!"", 'the game itself is enjoyable and rewarding if you remember it is a game and sometimes in games you lose. What is most important is the support I received when I ran into some serious issues with my account. the HoF team were respectful of my situation and helped as much as they could to remedy the problem. Thanks team, you made a difficult situation easier to handle. nothing to change. still having fun', ""2.6.20 Update As a Promo Game offers Free spins (10) but only at 150. I win a whole 259. According to Customer Support it is Supposed to be average of play which in my case is always Max Bet..225k or above. CS said fixed but just got 10 at 150. Was 5 Stars but now 1 Star. Developer sent me a gift but I can't collect it because review gets smaller. They don't even read the reviews. If they did I wouldn't still have the problem."", 'Need to stop with the god damn ad pop ups at every opportunity. I just log in and 6 in my face. Very slow going getting g coil s without paying has good games yet ads and low payouts at low bets make getting anywhere a grind. Theres apps like this one that literally give you half a million on a spin of the day that will keep you going on a decent while. This game requires you log in every 3 hours if you wanna get free coins', ""I have a loyal NFL player for years and I'm Highly dissatisfied with the play of HOF anymore!!!!! The last few months I have play I have had no play and have spent not millions but Billions of coins and nothing to show for it . Not even any enjoyment out of playing. The challenges suck, unless you spend thousands of dollars you can't win at any of them. HOF you should be ashamed!!!"", ""use to love this game but now it's all about spending money and you don't really win anything anymore. I've spent more money than I'd like to admit and I've gotten nothing for it!!! I wrote the first half about 2 months ago and it's starting to get a little better with more winning and payouts. Thank you and I hope you continue to make it better!! So I continued playing and the more I maximized my bet the more I won and I ended up winning a Grand Jackpot. Thank You So Much HOF"", ""This is probably one of the worst slot machine games first of all you hardly ever win the free spins that they give you hardly payout anyting. The free coins they give you are going within a few spins if you're lucky. So unless you buy coins you will hardly ever get to play the game. The slot games they have look like they're really fun but you never win!!! At least I never win anything even half way decent. I just had 30 free spins and I only one around 900 credit. That's pathetic!!!"", ""Don't like new set up, I know for a fact I bought over 150 dollars on card game and on the rare ones out of ten packs of gold sets only one rare card. I have never finished ANY CHALLENGE/ LEGENDS IN 4 years. Never. Note to self.... Never buy from them again. Sucker across my head. Never again. I was promised rare cards but only 1 in 150.00 dollars worth. I only closed 5 out of 10."", 'I am a long playtika diamond player and I love this game. I wish the free froggie games were like they used to be. The only draw back with house of fun is the free coin amounts. Most slot games once you reach my level of over 770 you are getting millions but here my amount is 3,500. My free gifts from friends is even lower. The games are fun but do not plan on billions because this game is not like that. Despicable critters is by far the best game. I hope the coins will go up one day.', ""House of Fun Casino slot machines has real looking slot machines. I think some of the casinos have these Slot machines in the showrooms. So if you really like slot machines, this is the game for you. Makes you feel like you're at the casino. This is a very fun app to play. I like this game. ."", ""I have been playing HOF games a lot lately and I have purchased a lot of suitcases in the last games. What I'm trying to understand...with that many purchases I should have visited every country on that board before my time runs out. I still enjoy playing. As of today I still like playing the majorjty of my day. I still like playing HOF games every day. Have fun. I like how every game have its own unique bonus"", 'I use to like this app but not only has it gotten harder to win coins but it glitches and freezes constantly. Worst part is when I contacted support. I was completely blown away by the way I was treated. He was clearly insinuating that I was making up what happened. He said I needed proof of what happened. I was only trying to make them aware of the issue and he was acting like I was trying to scam him out coins or something. He was pretty rude.', ""Been playing this game for one week. I can say that it's different from any other slots game that I played. It's my first time in almost 6 years of playing slot games (and I play alot and spend lots of money on slot games) that I ever won a jackpot. This game doesn't force you to pay to play and the fun part is the bonuses that the game gives to players apart from the slot machines."", 'This game is geared towards wasting your money more than most in the slots genre. You will win and get huge bonuses, then the rate this game comes up, then after you will straight lose with no bonuses in sight. And then surprise, the same thing will happen. After three days of the same pattern, this game is nothing but trash.', ""I like the game haven't had much time to play. I don't vin anything like it shows in the ADS . I'm new at this . I don't mind the ADs if there different ones gives me time to relax my eyes get a drink and a cigarette. And strech my body and come back to what ever level I'm on . Sometimes the same videos play over and over . Now if and when u let me win real cash or merchandise I can then buy something . Being on a fixed income very low income???? Lol., Makes it hard to buy anything for myself."", 'So a good slot machine and what you would expect to play at a casino has a payout percentage of a round 90% and if it is as little as 85% it is a terrible slot and should never be played. After spending a lot of time on the house of fun app and website I can find no written list of payout amounts on the slots they have but based my math the best payout of any of the games unlocked up to level 50 is around 65%. That is basically robbery. Most games pay back your bet or more only 10-15% of spins.', ""Great game! I wasn't sure about it for a few days, then i discovered all the extra ways to get coins beside watching videos. I racked up enough to start betting heavier and started actually winning enough to matter. The new slot challenge and the board game are both fun. The only thing I would change is once you have met a trunk challenge it would no longer show up. They should fall out somehow but no you open an iron trunk, get 2 figures and 1 is already finished. Not cool at all.""]"

Gold Rush Blackjack,com.gadgetcrafts.grblackjack,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gadgetcrafts.grblackjack&hl=en&gl=us,"Great graphics, three different tables, quick and clear gameplay. 

The object of Blackjack is very simple: to achieve a total that is greater than that of the dealer, and which does not exceed 21. 
You must consider your cards and your dealer's card and remember, if you go over 21, you lose. 
You win if: 
- Your total is higher than the Dealer's total. 
- The Dealer goes over 21 or ""busts"". 

If your total is the same as the Dealer's total it is a ""stand-off"" and you neither win nor lose. 
If you go over 21, or the Dealer's total is greater, you lose. 

The values of the cards: 

- Picture cards (Jack, Queen, King) each count as 10 points. 
- An Ace counts as 1 point or 11 points, whichever is better for owns of the hand. 
- All other cards have their numerical value. 

Blackjack is a combination of an Ace and any 10-points card.

I will always come back to this great poker game!!', 'Have had crash or freeze several times in the middle of tournaments. Then when you go to leave the lobby because its frozen it charges you for it. A double whammy of frustration.', ""I join and started playing Zynga poker since last few year. And I never say Zynga the worst. So far now I just started back after stop for 1 year cause of serving army, I realise now much easier to get free credit. Last time was $1 for 1m it's already very big and I crazy for that. But now, didn't expect much more easier and $1+ is worth much more than 1m. Thank you Zynga."", 'Seems Zynga lost interest in user experience and all they are providing nowadays is: bombardment of ads with no relevance, rigged spin wheels, rigged bonuses amd just about any trick up the sleeve to stream more revenue. Just another greedy brand! Used to enjoy, now im gone ✌', ""I'm not sure about this app,I haven't been able to login to play poker yet . So I'm not sure about the app all together that is because the App's not Responding at this time. Thanks again for working with me until the Very End! Thanks Again Zynga Pocker"", 'Great fun and challenging, stopped playing because of videos. Every time you leave a table you have to watch a commercial, no good.', ""An exciting,fun and wholesome game,I am so glad that the racism,bots and bad manners have been cleaned up, now its really fun to play...Good Job !!! I don't think you can improve this game, because you can't get past gouging for money, it is udicrous having a free game but costs a small fortune to play it and if course if you give a bad review....you lose every hand , paid chips or free chips, no matter. I am very disgruntled so I resign."", ""My experience was good till it tryed to force facebook app on me. Now it's just not fun anymore. The game has been losing players because people don't want facebook app on the phone!"", ""Best advise is not to buy anything. Recently I bought a sales pack, which had over 12 hours left for the sale, sadly once I purchased it, it gave me the response that the sale was over, still taking and purchasing this lower pack. The response of the devs is priceless. It basically says, sorry we can't do anything about it, but it's your fault, make sure you have the most up to date game and whatever other nonsense to pin it on the customer and not find fault to their game.

The only thing wrong is that, the only way you can carry on playing all other stages is if you purchese the full game (premium). That for me actually ruined my interest,not 2 mention it defeats the purpose of even down loading it in the first place... B awesome if i could even ride my new horse and carridge in² the new stage.... Otherwise grea5 game..."", 'Love the game; it\'s a fun way to boost your poker playing skills without using real money. However, on my galaxy s10 the entire right side of the screen is cut off so I can\'t see my $, or the ""next day"" button. That\'s a literal game changer.', ""Why am I being charged for installing this version . I thought it was free. At least it is what I am told in my account. $22 and something. Anyone? Wow!! After going over my purchase history it turns out I bought 10 Wild Cards. Fancy that!! For the life of me I just can't remember such event."", ""This was actually a nice game because I have this game on my laptop before but then unfortunately some error happened and I have no choice but to delete it. So I searched it again and installed it on my phone and It was very disappointing because I am stucked at the first city and the coalmine I wasn't able to travel to lubbock. This game wasn't like this before, because I don't have to purchase anything just to get access to another city."", 'The first two towns are free and then you have to buy the game. Not worth downloading at all unless you plan on buying the full version. Besides that (as other users claim) the ai tends to make ridiculous bets, which totally kills the game. I regret wasting time playing this', ""Never had so many bad hands in over 30 tournaments. The way ads are structured interrupts the game flow, and if we have to wait for commercials we don't need to see the small ones during game play. Game is on the verge of being uninstalled."", 'The games great, but the issue I have, and noticed others are also experiencing is the game doesnt quite fit on my screen (Samsung Galaxy S10+, which makes it hard to use certain controls.', ""Overall, the game is pretty nice and quite interesting, but one thing perturbs me a lot-- while playing 'Wild Card' tournaments, the winner does not get the prize money as an 'addition' to the wild cards already pledged. For example, if 2 wild cards are required to enter a game and the 2nd place is worth 1 card, I end up with only 1 card instead of 3. This is highly unjustified especially if someone has endured a 16 player game! Moreover, there is no other way except to pay for additional cards."", 'Game itself is fine, but it does not support the Galaxy S10 screen. Many menu options are cut off in such a way that a very precise, delicate tap is the only way to use some of the features and/or advance the game.', 'Decent game. I like the plot. However, as a beginner, I would like to have more time to study the hands of other players before their cards disappear and a new hand is dealt.', ""It was very irritated with all the ads. Hazard pop up constantly when you're playing a hand big distraction. Like the game is fun I don't want you to spend money or something it eventually and I'm not going to spend any money just a game I just want to play a game."", ""I used to play this game on the pc, it was fun and I regularly beat the players. Now you can't beat the players, they always have better hands than you do, so that you buy more chips. Why can't you play this game just for fun anymore?"", ""I play Poker in real life but to be honest it feels as though the AI knows that I'm having good cards, even right before the flop. When I raise even by a mere 8 bucks, it will fold. It's frustrating because it happens 9 out 10 times. What kind of algorithm do you claim that make the AI as realistic as possible? Because real people aren't that psychic."", ""Kinda meh. The game has a great idea behind it but the ai keeps over betting before we even get to see the first 3 cards. It would make sense if they had pockets or every once in awhile in a bluff, but that's just not the case. Every time its 40+ bucks to see the first 3 cards when you're only playing with 350 bucks total. I would have paid for the rest of the game if the ai didn't act the way it did. Its not fun it's just annoying."", 'IT WAS FREE PREVIOUSLY! got new phone, transferred apps over, reopened, low an behold, I had to start again, my previous amounts and level depleted and to find out I had to pay to continue to other parts of the state, I really enjoyed playing this game, you can even play with no internet connection which is great! its a shame that I have to uninstall it, gutted! I hope the developers reconsider in making it free, definately will return to change my ratings at a later date if changes are made 😊', 'Fun, but I wish you had the option to have to hit continue after each game so you can see why you lost. I want to learn.', 'Gets pretty difficult trying to leave the ""yellow"" cities. Seems like it wants me to buy some game currency to win a $3000 game. Don\'t go on the riverboat, it just goes to expert level areas. Despite Google Play integration, there\'s no apparent way to share my game progress across multiple devices or move my saved game to a new device.', 'The game has major elements cut off on some phones. On my Poco F1, probably 10-20% of the game is not visible on my screen.', ""The game didn't fit my phone screen that makes the right side of the game screen unseen...i loved the game but this issue bothers me so...i use vivo to play this game, but this issue only happen to this game, not the others..."", 'Love the game play, but I recently installed it on a Samsung s10e and when I am in the town, the next day button is cut off the edge of the screen.', 'You have to go through all the adds and finnally to continue the game you need to purchase it. I actually enjoyed the game.', 'Great game I was going to give 5 stars, but there are way to many ads, and when I turn off my data then the game decides to freeze. And why does some of the ads or most of the ads I get have no fast forward option. But like I said I love the but relax on the ads a bit. Really not impressed', ""I agree with some of the other users that it is clearly programmed so you can't win. The cards don't seem random and the other players bet enormous amounts of money and go all in on every hand, most of the time before the flop. And you very rarely have a better hand than them. So you don't even get to play for very long."", 'Wont go past the 1st 2 levels because it wants me to get full access I.e. pay. What a let down. Game is great but the pay before proceeding further sucks. Deleting it.', ""Having issues watching videos for tokens. I have not been able to do this for a day. I'm not wanting to use real money to play at this time, would like to watch ads in order to obtain cash. Why is it not working now? About to uninstall game. Not fun without cash."", 'Pretty sure a lot of these great reviews are fake... I beat both Amarillo and the Coal Mine, some guy gives me his horse and says I can travel to two new cities, but when I click them it tries to make me buy the ""full game""... useless and misleading.', ""It's so strikingly obvious that this is a scam 😂The A.I are obviously programmed to bet high so you can lose chips faster. This wouldn't even be so bad if the game wasn't so obviously scripted to have you lose because the A.I seems to have better cards than you 95% of the time. I'm not even exaggerating. I lost about 7 times consecutively and I was getting high cards 90% of the time. You can't even use the bank anymore like in the pc version. You instead turned it into a microtransaction scam."", ""I love playing poker but this game isn't worth downloading. With the small amount of money you start out with it isn't worth even playing because it bets too much money before it even shows the flop."", 'Great game. Lots of fun and long term playability. I love that there are no annoying pop up offers that plague so many other games. Players know where to find the offers and are able to acquire them without pop up ads making the game annoying. Kudos!', ""Poker is poker, but this has a plot and story line. Interesting to find out how it will end. Too bad Ineed to spend real money to continue and finish the game. It's a game which I just want to spend some fun time, and not waste money. Graphics are okay, and one tourney a day is just nice so that I wont waste too much time playing. Uninstalled"", ""It was fun, it help me learn... Says alot of games but after 5, you have to pay to unlock the whole board. So disappointed at the lack of advertisement about it being a free small demo, then pay for full game cause I wouldn't of downloaded it"", 'In screen ads constantly flashing at you mid game, ads redirecting you to play store after every game, and you have to pay for everything but the first area.', ""Sweet game luv the graphics and the little towns and people,just all around,it's seriously awesomeness in a game"", 'The game was good until it crashed so badly that clearing cache could not help. Unfortunately the game was never able to sync with Google Play Games either, so clearing data on the device would have erased all game progress. A good funny game which led to a huge disappointment.', ""Horrible game. It declares a winner against you when there has not been a winner. The board is cleared so fast till it is very difficult to catch. I had suspected it weeks ago. Today I was able to see when the screen froze before the so-called winner's hand could be removed. Terrible game. Dishonest game."", ""It's too easy to beat the AI's and you need to buy the game just to gain access for the whole map. Kinda dissapointing."", ""I love the game but it's not a full version. And when I want to buy it, all I get is processing.... screen."", ""I had this games for years full paid and that but now that I have the new Samsung s10 this game dosen't fit the scream so you cant play it. Please fix this I love the game."", ""Would rate higher but it's just a sample of a game. After you beat first city it tells you to if you want to play in more cities you gotta pay 4 dollars or something like that. Greatly disappointed"", 'I have not played this for a week and when I do, the game doesn\'t allow me to. Bought some houses, said it has daily ""INCOME"" but no. My chips never increase. Used to enjoy this on PC. Mobile version is totally a fail']"

Others think so too.', ""Good game but... 1. Bad beats are very common 2. Lots of inexperienced players making lousy calls but get lucky, usually on the river 3. Seems to favour short stints and not long sessions. Lots of players get lucky jumping on a table and hitting a hand instantly and then nothing for reams of hands. It's swings and roundabouts.

I just wish there was a way to have a chat room of communication aspect of the groups or even just over all that isn't limited to preset sentences. You should be able to strategize or communicate with team members or friends. Also the links placed out there for freebies should actually work and give u the reward. They not in my case."", ""Fake and boring 1. The game is not live so it is false advertisement. (No waiting time and playable in airplane mode...weird). 2. The winning appear to be scripted depending on how much you bet. So never bet high or you'll lose. 3. Using the 4000 coins power up instead of the 500 coins does not increase at all your likelyhood of doing more than one Bingo...you just waste more money."", 'Love this game had it before on my fire tablet but had to uninstall for the same reason I am uninstalling it now. I crashes religiously or it tells me there is new content to update and then gets stuck on the start up screen. I just installed this app a few days ago and everytime I open it it closes. When I reopened it I get to the game and while selecting my opinions its crushes and close out again I have only been able to play this app twice since installing it. This game is not fun anymore.', ""I really do love this game it's my favorite bingo game. I'm a bit disappointed with the fact that now you can only buy 1 scratchy (mini game) at a time unlike when the game first came out you could buy as many as you wanted so I would really like it if you could bring that back so I can get lots at once thanks."", 'Really enjoy playing the game, but sometimes it is days before I get a bingo and trying to finish the mountains is so difficult, then once you get close that one is done ( I have made it thru occasionally) the club I belong to, I was the only one that was even playing the game, now there is at least one new club member that is also winning, finally.....', 'I have played bingo pop for a long time! IT has been one of my favorite bingo game. The issue I have is I cant afford to buy cherries ..I am on a low fixed income and even tho it is an exciting game I can play maybe 2 or 3 games in an evening!! Therefor i am deleting the game to free up room for another. Thank you! Nancy', ""I've been playing for a long time. It's a pretty good bingo game. My complaint is this, Everytime there is an update it feels like you are adding more things that have to be purchased and taking away the free aspect of the game. I promise that one more update that is for your benefit and not for the benefit that matters, us, I'm dropping this game."", ""Dont play this I have changed my mind. As soon as you level high the chances of getting a good payout gets slim. As your level get up there they only give you 20 cherries each time when I think is very stupid. If they cared about the players they would do better on the part that requires us leveling up. Until that is fixed I'm going to not play this and play bingo story since I think it's better and more fun."", ""Sometimes you have to wait a while for a big enough win to extend play but it does happen. The best thing is multiple bingo wins in a game, so longer fun. I've actually just hit a mega bingo so big I feel actually rich lol. Unlike other games this one has lengthy gameplay (mostly) without costing money. Thanks bingo pop. Xx"", ""Awesome game fun and even got my husband playing lol easy play with auto daub for higher card bets... If ever you have an issue!!! Which you may come on it's a game.. Contact support.. No joke they reply fast and actually fix the issue!! Or explain in some cases... Why it's not actually an issue... 😳"", 'I have playing this game on and off for a while now and I have seen some updates that make this game do fun and I play this game almost everyday!! I like that there are so many different ways to collect cherries and that it is challenging but fun! Thanks for making a bingo game that never bores me!', ""When you have 32 spins of engery and you can't even get half way up the mountain....uninstall and forget about this game. Better bingo games out there to play. Looks like the same automatic reply l have seen in many other reviews I have read."", 'Not enough cherries available in game to keep playing without paying with real money. Levels completed give you cherries the 1st completion then only add 1 cherry to a pot you get every hr, to play 2 cards and get puzzle pieces or possible cherry for bingos you have to bed 30+ cherries if you lose you cant play without paying. Most rewards are coins which you rarely need, you only use coins for buying buffs on some games 500 or 4000. They need to add coin option bingos to win cherries.', ""Had a bug that wasn't letting me do one of the events, staff were great to deal with and even gave me the rewards I should've recieved if the event had worked. Unlike some other bingo games, just giving it a day or two will give you enough cherries to play a round again"", ""this is one of my favorite games of all time it's very interesting the graphics are great and you win quite a bit which on the other games is very disappointing that's the tickets are so much to please game and that you very rarely win this game is not like that you in quite a bit and makes you much more exciting I love love love this game"", 'Never lets you win, only wants you to pay to keep playing. If you do win you are only getting one bingo. Why would I spend money on a loss cause. This game use to be fun but they have taken that out of the game play.', ""As thoigh it does not have a good optoon to getting more resources, i am completely addicted 😂. ifs my favorite bingo app. NEW UPDATE: I wish y'all would go back to the old scratchers where you got multiple, and also new puzzles for the scratchers."", ""I've played this game for over year and still love it. There has been a few technical issues but these guys will answer any question and do their best to remedy any problems. Love this game!"", ""Bingo wins are few and far between. League points are a joke because you get them from winning multiple bingos. The game used to be fun, now it's not."", ""Absolutely love the gameI play it often I gave it a one-star to get somebody's attention because on your daily spins you have three wheels well one of my wheels will not unlock I invite friends daily I've shared it on Facebook and still cannot get that wheel to unlock"", '2/20. Had an issue after the latest update and it was fixed promptly!! Since the update, I dislike the fact that for those that choose not to purchase anything, it is not worth my time. I feel like I am not getting anywhere with a wheel that gives you 8 cherries and/or not able to collect as many tickets. And if you do, the pets are pretty worthless. Considering deleting and finding a new Bingo game.', ""I have a guest Acct which I use on my cell And on my tablet I use my FB Acct. If you accidentally tap FB you can't get it back unless you go to settings and tap feedback to send a request. It's been several days and I still don't have the option to just play as guest. The game is fun but too much trouble I'm thinking about deleting it. You end up paying way too much money while playing anyway"", 'I love Bingo Pop so many games to choose from plus mini games really lots of fun. On top that you get different mini games all the time plus free cherries try you will love it.', ""Been playing this bingo game for 6 weeks now and to be honest it is the worst bingo game to play on the market! The first 48 hours of playing you win a lot, then that stops! This is pre-recorded bingo, not live! It has already decided if you win or lose before you play! I'm lucky if I can get a single line! The payouts are pathetic but they expect you to pay out of you pocket just for you to keep on losing! There are fairer bingo games on the market, play them not this!"", 'Love this game, just wish there were better ways to get more cherries instead of having to keep paying for them, but definitely a favorite of mine.', 'Fun game but...... I have been playing Bingo Pop for quite a while now (level 745) and I don\'t know where to start.... First I would love to see the game be a little more fair spending 1000 cherries and only getting a couple hundred in return gets old. You save save and save just to lose them all in the first couple tries sucks! Also the events are getting more and more expensive are far as needing points to complete them. It recently gave more what I call the ""lightning bolts"" to play the slot machine game but at the same time it cost more event points to complete them. Then suddenly the points stayed the same but the higher rewards went away, very frustrating. The Step Ladder game I\'ve played hundreds of times and never won the grand prize. The Bingo Derby game is an even bigger waste of time, you pick 3 horses and never come close winning more than 10-15 cherries. The games have become so expensive to play and you need 4 million points to complete an event to win the lightning bolts just to come up short when getting dice, I understand that these types of games/apps are here for fun and to make money for the creators but maybe if the game was a little more fair people would be more inclined to spent actual money. My suggestions..... Allow more cheaper ways to accumulate daily cherries Be allowed to purchase cherries with coins Needing less points to complete an event More Dice when playing slots. When you get to play a bonus game like Step Ladder or Derby make it worth while. Make the daily/weekly/monthly bonuses more lucrative (example.... get 4 Mega bingos and win 20 cherries!!) If you get 4 Mega bingos it should be a huge bonus, just saying.', 'I love Bingo Pop! There are so many rooms to play in, including high rollers. Daily achievements are fun and challenging', ""I LOVE this game. I play it every day. Whenever I've had any issues with the game, the tech support staff have listened to the problem, done everything to try to fix the problem and have reimbursed me for the cherries and coins that I've spent when the problems have occured. Awesome tech support help!"", ""I absolutely love Bingo Pop! It's a very fun game, the cherry payouts could be a little bit more, but I rarely have to spend money to replace them because of the many ways you could earn them....there are all sorts of activities within the game to keep things fun and interesting. ....I often find myself spending countless hours just playing..... Awesome game!!!!!!!"", ""By FAR the best bingo game EVER! It just doesn't work on my new LG ARTISTO 3+. In order to play i have to use an old phone."", ""I get 3 instant bingo power-ups on 4 cards and not get one bingo never get mega bingos. It has'nt changed, still do not win much think they want you to just keep buying stuff i uninstall and start over. No better than before seems to have gotten worse. Still no better, if you are playing to win you won't. No just want to know what it takes to get a Mega Bingo in the High Stakes"", ""Fun game.... Hard to win though and can tell it purposely doesn't let you win.... Games loose their fun when they are so blatantly rigged.... Just sayin'"", 'I used to love this app but have been noticing the more regularly I play, the less I win. I have spent hundreds of dollars on this game and will get fewer and fewer wins or winning streaks. I would also say that the rewards and what you receive for in-app purchases are definitely not what you would expect for how pricey they are. You should reward your avid loyal players, not price gouge! Hope this app gets a revamp soon or I will have to find another favorite...', ""Bingo is my favorite game to play, until I start feeling cheated! I spend WAY more money on this game than my electric bill is monthly, I could take my money to play real bingo and win actual money/prizes. If you make any in app purchases to play high rounds, don't count on winning or breaking even. You will loose everything you just paid for! When you finally get spins you win coins and that's it. When you are so close to winning prize, you stop earning points or they don't get added!"", 'There was this other bingo game that used to be my favorite, but it got too outrageously complicated and you could never win without forking over $$! I decided to try ""BINGO POP"" and I am so happy that I did! It is by far my favorite bingo game EVER, and I have been playing it for over a year now...it just keeps improving and the changes are minimal without having to break out your wallet! Love this game so much and to the developers; Keep up the excellent job. Definitely deserve the ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐! 👍👍', ""If I could play it more for free I would give it 5 stars. Sometimes I have to go days collecting free cherries to be able to finally play a round and then not get a single bingo on any of my cards. So it's back to collecting the free items and waiting. It's ok tho, I still love the game!"", ""OMG!!!! This is the best bingo games I've ever played,and I am totally addicted to it big time. Love you bingo pop xx"", 'The more you play the more you will love this game. TIP. EARN THOSE CHERRIES ! I have completed the challenges and was well rewarded 😍', 'Re Editing my Review Sadly dropped a star and a half. I play religiously everyday.. I SPEND MY MONEY TO PLAY ASWELL and it just keeps getting worse. Ive played for YEARS and get nothing. Games quit rewards give 3 whopping cherries for big level players THAT SPEND MONEY so please. All of us that are dedicated to your game..give us a little recognition. Ill shut down our 103 players here now but i do not want to. Thank u', ""The game is very fun. Unfortunately, though I can't play very long because I can't afford the high priced bingo chips. Even the level up rewards are pathetic. And when you do get a bingo you don't even come close to getting your chips back even if you're in the top three.""]"

Vegas.com,com.vegas.mobile,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vegas.mobile&hl=en&gl=us,"The Vegas.com app puts the Vegas lowdown at your fingertips, and delivers a heck of a time. Its mission is to go where no app has gone before in answering the age-old Las Vegas question: “What now?” Because having the most fun in Las Vegas isn’t just about what you’re doing now. It’s about what you’re doing next.

This is a useful, intuitive-to-you, real-time, insider-sourced, comprehensive connection to fun in Las Vegas, serving up all the information you need, the way you want it, so you can have the best time possible when you’re in Las Vegas. 

If you're not in Vegas, the app allows you to easily plan and book your upcoming Vegas vacation. And, when you're in Vegas, the app really shines.  It:

• Geo-informs results so you know what’s happening near you.

• Geo-locates you in relation to target destinations. So “where’s the bathroom?” is really “where’s the nearest bathroom?”

• Allows you to wishlist all your favorite Vegas experiences.

• Presents information in both object and theme sets, so for instance, you can look up spas, attractions, or magic shows as easily as you can look up Off the Beaten Path, All-Night Party, or Hangover Helpers (most likely in that order). 

• Allows you to search for your Vegas experience by date, interest, staff picks and more.

The filters are too coarse. Eg Can select mimimum guest review score of 6 or 8, but not 7. 6 includes too much rubbish. 8 excludes some satisfactory hotels. Prices frequently uncompetitive.', ""Superb! so simple, easy and made my bookings a pleasure to do, such a lot of choice and a great rewards scheme, also such a good level of customer service its unreal, phone number was easy to access didn't hold for long and MY error was kindly and patiently corrected for me by a really lovely telephonist i cannot praise them enough, in my experience 5* is genuinely deserved for the entire package!"", ""This is bs. I've tried to create my account many times to collect nights for a free room and this app will not allow me to create the account. They dangle a free night to you but won't allow you to collect the points to get it. I stay in hotels about 5 nights a week. This is so unfair. And it won't allow you to post yes about the deceptive add questions. I wish the would get it together because I've been screwed out of a lot of free room. And I only use this app for booking. \U0001f92c\U0001f92c\U0001f92c"", ""I've used it for awhile, in most cases it saves you pennies on the real cost of the hotel. In the end you do get a free reward night....or do you? I booked on my free reward night and they billed my credit card anyways and upon questioning it they just cancel your booking and tell you it will take a week to refund your money that they were able to take in seconds. Customer service is garbage, rewards are a lie, and they will fill your inbox with junk promotions and garbage. 0 stars."", 'The only benefit to using the app over desktop is it waives the $5 booking fee for free nights that you\'ve earned. Using free nights on the app is misleading- you can\'t redeem your free nights unless you pay now, and this isn\'t mentioned anywhere. Reminders are annoying: ""Your booking is in 2 days!"" ""You just checked in!"" ""You just checked out"" Thank goodness they can be turned off.', ""Sit back, relax and book your hotel. Extremely easy to navigate and book your next hotel and everything regarding your booking is contained within the app so you can go back and check details etc plus by using the app you get to save up loyalty points and when you've stayed a total of 10 nights in hotels booked through the app you get a night free."", ""It's hotels dot com, so you already know if it's good. I do wish there was a way to enter coupon codes on the app, as well as sort by the membership level. I prefer to find properties that have the little credits for a drink or 2 in the lounge(especially during holidays or busy weekends and check in takes longer due to the cleaners having more rooms to clean and such), and would be nice if there were a way to search between hot and cold breakfast. But, it functions as needed for my family!"", ""I've been using this app for years and it's always my go to for any trip, with the family or with the girls. They have better access to hotels when others say they're sold out. The prices are competitive with package travel sites and the reward system helps too."", ""I've been using it for 5+ years now although it's rewards program that isn't efficient First you guys need to realize that the app is giving hard time to me and behaves strangely for family bookings It can cost you money and trouble if you trust its misleading info I have just received email asking me to call them on non working number format for a reported issue because they're receiving too much emails so obviously more issues Recently they introduced chat but you'll repeat stories if reset"", ""Used to be 5 star until my last booking did not reach the hotel for some reason. Then they cancel it and refund my money but tell me to re-book using the app. Umm .. It didn't work the first time, why would I waste my time again? Plus, I'm sitting in the hotel lobby. Why can't YOU just rebook it for me? So now I don't get the night credit towards my free night, and what if the hotel was fully booked (it was Chicago on a Saturday night)? Thankfully it wasn't and the man at the hotel was helpful."", ""Hotels. Com is great for booking hotels at good rates but the mobile apps is bad. I make 2 bookings but only show the latest. I have to key in my confirmation number to search. What's the point of having this app if I have to remember and search everytime I want to check my bookings? The interactive help page is hopeless. I can find my booking after searching but it keeps telling me it can't find. Its totally out of sync."", ""I've been using this app to find well priced and decent hotels to stay in for 2 years. I've never had a reason to try any others. I've never had an issue finding what I want, and I always get what I expect based on ratings, photos, and description."", ""I absolutely love this app. I used to just use Priceline, but after having several bad experiences with them recently I decided to switch. Thank goodness I did because now I actually get rewarded for my loyalty. It's easy to use and if your staying in a certain place you like, extending your reservation a day at any time is a breeze. Plus their prices are the best I have seen."", ""I'm not thrilled with this app. The only benefit seems to occur when it's time to redeem free nights. In order to keep from being charged $5 fir redemptions, it has to be done via the app. I don't like the fact that when I leave the app even for a brief second, it returns back to the home screen so any search that has occured is gone. Also, if you take time away from the app for any length of time, you are automatically logged out. None of this happens to me in the web browser."", ""I think this has good promise. I just can't seem to save my booking in the app? Every time I close the app and reopen the app it has dissapeared and I have to reenter the booking number. Also, it seems I have logged on with Facebook but when I try and change my password, it says that I don't have an account?"", 'App is rubbish. Its doesnt save your booking. Instead you have to go to your email to get the booking number, then input it to the app (no it still doesnt save) Pointless as when it finds the booking it has the same info as the email!........ just use the email!', 'I use the app on my cell phone and the results are good. Traveled the US and booked all my rooms thru the app, have redeemed 5 nights so far. The only complaint is the damn app always uses euros for pricing my redeemed room value. There is NO WAY to change it to dollars!', ""Easy - However there always seems to be quite a big difference between the non-refundable cost and the 'free cancellation' cost - which actually means that you are paying for the privilege of cancellation."", ""I booked a condo couple of months ago for a new year's trip in PV only to be cancelled 10 days before my visit. The reason given was the available schedule published in the site did not match the condos availability, which ended with double booking. If there was double booking, I should have been notified immediately... not 10 days before my trip. This very inconvenient."", ""The best application to book hotels. You get rewards for the amount of nights you spend. After you collect 10 nights from your stay, you will get rewarded one free night (you have to use the application from your phone to redeem your free nights instead of using the web browser, or you'll get charged a fee for it). Also, after you collect 20 more nights, you will get a gold rewards. This will allow you to get VIP on hotel stays. Highly recommend this application!"", ""Extremely frustrated that I had to fill out my information when booking 2x for different transactions and it came back that those hotel rooms were full. However, when I refresh the page, it's still showing available. Now I have 2 $400+ transactions pending on my bank account. There shouldn't be any transactions if the place is full."", 'Not happy! Booked a room in September, for February. Go into this site, tells me "" reservations is guaranteed & all paid for"". To make changes, it\'s easy. I go to change 1 day . Now I get, we\'re unable to find any room that match my criteria. WTH! So if u book with this site, call the hotel, to make sure the reservations went through.', 'I enjoy using the app. However, I used to be able to pay at front desk whenever I arrive, on the updated version I cannot find this option. I have pay online using a card or PayPal account. I rather pay cash at the desk sometimes and preferred having this option available.', ""Having lot's of trouble with the app, confirmation emails are late and sometimes I.don't get them. When I do get them, I get 5 or 6 of the same one. When ask to review check in, it tells me that the time has expired and when asked about my stay, it tells me that there isn't a page."", 'Tried to search for a hotel, saw a nice deal, tried to touch on the hotel to check details, got booted out back to my search and could not book it. It was not lack of room, managed to find the same deal on the website and it worked there. Also, wanted to send a picture to the person I was reserving a room with showing the deal and hotel name, but the app blocks me from taking screenshots. Finally, after booking, the booking does not show on the app for some reason.', 'This app has a ton of glitches and have been there for at least 8 months. Its very frustrating that they now blocked you from taking a screenshot of your confirmation and the manage booking button also doesnt work, and i havent received the email so now I have to call making the convenience of the app pointless. Makes no sense', 'Well, so far not real impressed, booked on my iPad and then looked it up on my phone and there was no information about my booking , I put in my conformation number which brought everything up but there was no way to save any of it to my phone, now I have to write my confirmation number down and keep it with me', ""Terrible service support and they also cheat. I did a booking under free cancellation 24 hours and then I had to cancel booking because my plans has changed. But when I cancel booking just after few hours I saw that they still change me for one night. When I was trying to reach support I received we are having to many emails can't get to you bla bla. Will not recommended this booking service to anyone."", 'Seriously infuriating app. It can\'t recognize hotel addresses or locations that the website pills up just fine. So much for the ""special pricing"" in the app when you can\'t even book a trip based on the city you\'re traveling to. 😠', ""Poor. Free cancellation is not free. Hidden away in terms and condition NOT transparent at all. Back and forth with the hotel has shown its a special offer but HIDDEN! BE WARNED. won't be using this again. Lesson learned."", ""Nothing wrong with the app itself. But apparently they can show rooms that don't exist. And once you have paid for that room there is no refund even if they move you to a different room that was cheaper."", 'Good, but wish you could filter by if they have a hot tub, not only ""spa"", which can mean several things. Otherwise, very user friendly.', ""I don't know what is going on with this app. Is logging me out all the time. And when i try to log in is telling me that they have technical issues. How i'm i going to collect nights? If i can't log into my account!

I get no options like ""share this to your story"" or ""add this to your story"". Plz check. Overall its a great app. Fun to use. I can spend hours using insta👍', ""Love it. But only 3 stars as Insta is too snappy to delete my posts if I try to create a new and neat account/clean page. If it wasn't so eager to delete my posts I'd give it 4 stars. If it was possible to upload and create posts from a desktop I would give it 5 stars. Also in the last few weeks my profile photos keep going missing. Every couple of days. Really annoying.""]"

Ads.', ""the only complaint I have, which is with any poker game I've downloaded, is that there are people who truly don't know how to play and just always go all in on every hand. It makes it frustrating when your trying to build a pot up and they run everyone off. However that's with every poker app i've played. Other than that, I enjoy and like this app very much. Awesome"", 'I started playing Zynga Poker since 2009... I\'m addicted because this is not only a poker game, this game needed a lot of patience to read each player\'s pattern in order to play wisely and earn your chips, well of course sometimes it still depend on our luck on what cards we have... this could be challenging sometimes, but that\'s the fun of it. Whenever, you have to fold, just remember ""there\'s always next hand"" 😜', 'Game was cool at the beginning, I\'ve been playing now for about a week, and it keeps freezing. I have rewards that I can\'t claim because it keeps saying ""Oh No please try again"". I\'ve been trying to collect these awards for the past three days, and can\'t get them. I tried sending an email to the developer to state my issue, but the email address provided above doesn\'t work.', ""You never get any good cards, you'll get jack 2 3 times in a row then get one 2 and a 5. Dont even waste your time, I played for 2 hours and didn,t win once. The other players win with pairs of 2 or high card. And the one time, every once in a lifetime, when the game decides to hook you up, the other player gets a full house. This game is terrible people, if you want to waste your time, go ahead and get this game and play with a bunch of high cards."", 'Stop the automatic ads! Used to be 5 stars, but now it is so annoying. These are terrible and force the user to wait to take the next action (play another game or buy chips). The watch add to win chips was a great compromise for both parties. Now these adds play but users have no choice and are not compensated. If the adds go away I would go back to 5 stars. Even a pro-ad free version would be better for users.', ""I spent $50 to increase my wallet and in contribution to the developer for literally so many hours of fun I have had in 10 years of playing. The app's A.I. saw I increased my $$ and buy in levels, and within a couple of weeks set all new unrealistic daily challenges for me, which encourages playing at even HIGHER levels. Not cool. If I were truly addicted, I could see spending way more than my means. That could pose real harm to people with no self control. From 5 stars to 3 for ethical reasons."", ""I am confused!! I had 788+mil chips. Joined 2.5/5m table with 250m chips. Ended with 330m chips. I should have had a total of about 860+ mil chips. Insted I have 670mil chips!!

Every 3 seconds it says connection lost and goes to the main screen. On laptop WiFi, Always stuck on loading. Takes 5 minutes for the app to open as well. On PC direct came connection. Same thing. Takes 5 minutes to open app. When i win chips they never go to my bank. When i am rewarded, i never get the rewarded chips or platinum chest i buy. Or friend chips. What did you All do to this game? Before it was so simple and playable. YOU NEED TO UPDATE!', 'Big problem! The game quit unexpectedly I lost 800+ million of chips because of this.Sometimes game sound is automatically change in this app.For try to fix the sound issue I uninstall the app and later reinstalled again but the problem is there.Till now I did this a total of 5 times. Please fix the problem. About the app - Earlier the app is ok but now a days its became boring and problematic 👎I sent couple of mail to Zynga poker but no response receive till now.', ""This isn't actual poker. It's poker-like. Hands are intentionally setup to encourage aggressive bidding. The app does graciously give credits, but this type of setup eats through those credits. Any two pair is always close enough to be trumped by a straight, etc... Seemingly, certain players or bots are favored. It's not luck, this game is more or less rigged. Bad beats abound. They're out for yr $. It's not unique. All of them operate the same. There isn't one true-to-the-game app out there."", ""Hello. I'm not able to connect any events. I complete the challenges but every time then I'm trying to click and collect my bonuses it shows me An error accrued and asking to reload the game. I'm very frustrated about this and asking to fix the bug. I deleted the game and downloaded again but this didnt help. Hope to hear from you ASAP"", 'There is definitely a glitch with this game. I have played Spin & Win now countless times tonight and have gotten the lowest payout every single time. That is mathematically impossible if it is truly a wheel. On top of that it has stopped asking me to join a game after that game. And I have not received my pay out a few times on Spin & Win.', ""It's an okay app. Can be a bit buggy at times. One thing I've noticed is it's not wise to buy any chips. Just play with whatever free chips you are given starting out, take advantage of challenges and build your chips from there. Soon as you buy chips you will hit a wave of absolutely frozen cards because it seems their algorithm figures you will just buy more when you lose."", ""Just installed and played this game for the first time in years... And I now remember why I gave up on it in the first place. So glitchy. Lags out, makes you miss bets,awards the worst hand as the winner and just an unbelievable mess. Not to mention the rng is so damn bad it's literally unbelievable. Think I will uninstall again."", ""This game was good until you do the mistake and buy chips. Then you always get bad luck, you can't do watch to earn, when you use your tickets to open gold cases there is almost nothing inside and of course they do that so you end up not having any chips and forced to buy some, since they cancelled the free stuff for you after buying once. I used to play this game a lot but now I am uninstalling and never playing again cause this is just fraud. Customer happiness isn't a priority anymore."", ""Everytime I try to play now it kicks me off, and now want let me sign it !! This game has been going down badly for the last couple of years!!! I've been playing Zynga Poker for the last 9 years and the first 6 or 7 years it was a Awesome Card Game but now to many glitches!!! Really getting disappointed with the Zynga Poker !! 😪"", ""I have really enjoyed this game...It's actually quite addicting. Then, to top it off, I had a slight issue, e-mailed them, not only did they respond right away, but they rectified the issue promptly. Super nice customer service. Come play!!"", ""The zynga devs a cheating on people, believe me I am a developer too and I know what's going on, the app lures you to bet and increase with good hands just to lose all so after you have to purchase from zynga and this happens mostly to people who have purchased few times from them. If you purchase the program detects that you have purchased and have you losing all so that you have to purchase again, I play poker for almost 10 years, it impossible to lose about 50 hands in a row in real game."", ""I love zynga & I have for some years now .Don't get me wrong we've had our ups and downs but we both usually agree to disagree and that's what I luv the most about zynga poker !keep up the good work, and keep me in mind for one of those lucky 15 going to the wsop!would really be a life changer for someone like me!thank ye again for your time and consideration ... Sincerely yours, thee-Zynga-Prince."", ""I've been playing this game for years.. I've never had any issues (except for the fact I have crappy luck).... It is what it is and I love that you don't have to spend a penny if you don't want to... Please don't mess it up with updates. It's not broken, so leave it alone and don't fix it..."", ""Can u explain why ur supposed to be fair...last 10 times everytime 2 pairs turns into a straight by another..that never happens that many times at a table..only a software generated game can do that! Everytime! I have 2 pair, he has a straight or vise versa! I've played for 5 plus yrs and I'm angry your ripping people off"", 'I like the way it is a real looking poker table looks. And the new way of getting more chips looking at the ads. It beats the spin where, if yor lucky, you may get 300k. And then you have to wait 4 hours to get the next bonus.', 'This game is amazing no doubt about it! But when the nfl football mode was implemented into the game everytime i click on challanges it kicks me from the game as say ""oh no"" will this be fixed soon due to the fact I\'m trying to complete this week\'s challanges for the big rewards. Thank you😊', ""Played this game for 3 days now. The amount of four to a flush/four to a straight hands I've seen is really quite unrealistic,also seems.to.be quite a lot of full house's.tjis could.be due to.the skill levels of the players though. Would recommend this to.learn the basics of poker but that's really about it."", ""This isn't poker, how can you play when people go all in on anything and everything...this is stupid! And more ads than than ever! Cant play with out being interrupted by advertising, probably a good thing this game sucks! Now they send a response to my rating and blow smoke up my azz. Money hungry kock sukers...idiots run this app! Send me another b.s. response! Cant wait...idiots! Have a nice day...sound familiar? LOL"", ""Now that you are forcing everybody to watch ads it is really hurting at the the performance of this game. A person should not have to watch an ad in order to play poker and the force to watch an ad on top of that. You really need to lose that!!! Now if a person chooses to watch an ad in order to receive free chips that's up to that individual but he shouldn't have to be forced to watch an pop-up ad."", 'The game has gotten way better since the last time i downloaded it. I deleted it a while ago due to people hacking my chips. But this time around they seemes to have fixed the issue. I will always come back to this great poker game!!', 'Have had crash or freeze several times in the middle of tournaments. Then when you go to leave the lobby because its frozen it charges you for it. A double whammy of frustration.', ""I join and started playing Zynga poker since last few year. And I never say Zynga the worst. So far now I just started back after stop for 1 year cause of serving army, I realise now much easier to get free credit. Last time was $1 for 1m it's already very big and I crazy for that. But now, didn't expect much more easier and $1+ is worth much more than 1m. Thank you Zynga."", 'Seems Zynga lost interest in user experience and all they are providing nowadays is: bombardment of ads with no relevance, rigged spin wheels, rigged bonuses amd just about any trick up the sleeve to stream more revenue. Just another greedy brand! Used to enjoy, now im gone ✌', ""I'm not sure about this app,I haven't been able to login to play poker yet . So I'm not sure about the app all together that is because the App's not Responding at this time. Thanks again for working with me until the Very End! Thanks Again Zynga Pocker"", 'Great fun and challenging, stopped playing because of videos. Every time you leave a table you have to watch a commercial, no good.', ""An exciting,fun and wholesome game,I am so glad that the racism,bots and bad manners have been cleaned up, now its really fun to play...Good Job !!! I don't think you can improve this game, because you can't get past gouging for money, it is udicrous having a free game but costs a small fortune to play it and if course if you give a bad review....you lose every hand , paid chips or free chips, no matter. I am very disgruntled so I resign."", ""My experience was good till it tryed to force facebook app on me. Now it's just not fun anymore. The game has been losing players because people don't want facebook app on the phone!"", ""Best advise is not to buy anything. Recently I bought a sales pack, which had over 12 hours left for the sale, sadly once I purchased it, it gave me the response that the sale was over, still taking and purchasing this lower pack. The response of the devs is priceless. It basically says, sorry we can't do anything about it, but it's your fault, make sure you have the most up to date game and whatever other nonsense to pin it on the customer and not find fault to their game.

Here's a new update with fixes to improve your game experience!
Have fun & good luck!","['most of the games are just like a little over the top! but they are addictive, some of your time is beating numbers and most of your time is spent to defeat a certain character in the quest! The challenges are the new games and keep you coming back! Seems like slots are to tight. Maybe loosen them some or not!! But the newer players might stand a chance and return! Alot of the older players have changed and teams dont work on challenges as a team!! Guess one alone is a team!! Ty Verlin', ""The games are good, I want to play more but there's just waaay too many interruptions. When you go to the casino, no one stands behind you bugging you, except maybe the wife if she wants more money. I just want to play slots. Why do you have to ' level up'? Double U is the Only one, so far, that is worth the time. My time anyway. See ya."", ""Ok you say you don't fix the game, but I have to Disagree with your answer. I have tried to finish the first board on the quest game. First day finished all but the last game , fast forward to today and i am still on the same place, i have filled 25pigs with coins and I i have gotten free spins around 20 times and yet I still have only half of the amount needed to finish the game. So over 1,000 spins at 25 million a spin. I started to game with 20 billion in coins. So yes you do cheat us"", ""And back down to 1 star. Updating to 3 stars as I've won some coin and been able to play again for a few days. I'm forced to change my rating from 4 stars to 1 star. I have done nothing but lose. Rewards seem tied to your level (mine is relatively low as a newer player), but dash and quest goals seem based on bet history. Since I'd built up some coin and was betting higher, my requirements are through the roof, and not in line with the reward. I've even made purchases, but still lose lose lose."", 'Not enough wins. It used to be fun and win big but now it has this sloto card collection and you never complete the albums to win the money and they games stopped paying out big money. I do not like how you have alot of money and the game will freeze and suddenly it was betti g the max and your down millions of dollars without even doing anything! Slotmania really needs yo work on this and make the games more pmayer friendly in order to keep the players interest or they will go elsewhere', ""It's an ok game can be frustratingly hard to win, have never bought into game cash wise therefore do not expect to get far. I have got up to 150m chips but lost 95% of that in an hour too easily, slotto cards are like McDonalds monopoly game almost impossible to get the high ranking cards in order to boost coin bank game will peeter out eventually and get uninstalled."", ""I've reviewed this game several different times. My reviews are always different some good. Some bad. Hmmm.. kinda like when u go to a real casino. Sometimes u leave mad sometimes u leave happy! More often than not I leave mad. But you always go back. Ha. Really it's one of my favorite games. It's the only one ive kept on my phone. I do play it everyday. One of the best assets is there is always a sloto representative available to help you on live chat!! And %95 of the reps are aWeSoMe!!!"", 'THANK YOU for big wins but you make Quests almost impossible esp. When free spin wins are needed. We players just lose n lose. In the new album all I collect are duplicates have 82 different cards and more than double that number in duplicates. No fun play a whole day with big bets and get no new cards usually. Loosen up please.', 'All the free spins and win no coins. 100 spins and nothing. Can loose 2 to 3 billions daily2/21/2020 was just playing 25million and when I spun 450millio was taken from my spin. At times when you win it does not add up to the correct spin. Can spin 100 turns and get 1 or 2 bonuses. Feel we should get more spins and win more foin like on Caesars casino slots', 'The new Around the World challenge is fun. The Daily Dash games are an extreme amount of coins -- How do you win 32 Billion Coins with only a few Thousand or maybe a Million to start. Big push at every turn to ""Buy more and More.Coins."" Really like the Clans as it gives you all more chances to all win and share during the adventures. UPDATE 2-16-2020 Has made it nearly impossible for players to enjoy the games. Dash and Quest games now require Trillions, very few Scatters or Free Spins.', ""Hi i love the game, it's part of my mornning. But am going to call BS on sloto quest played for two days spent over 2 Trillion to finish the level and nothing cant get free spins and not a single ace pack. Thats betting 1 to 4 billion per hand. Then on top they ask you to play as part of daily tasks. Ihave some friends that have just gotten rid of game alltogether."", ""Tried once again with this game. Now suddenly diamonds are missing as well as coins. Surprise! Customer support wont work either! What a waste of real money and time! This game was once fun. Too bad it's all about GREED now. This game is designed to rob you, play something else, y'all"", 'Love the Game, I have had a very good time playing my Favorite game while Recuperating from back Surgery. I try to rate going into the VIP. Section but I dont see where to go to rate,so hopefully thisvisvthe right section. I have had some very big Wins,an very big losers,I Enjoy the game,the Clan group I am in is Awesome, we enjoy not just the game but about life too an were we are from all over the World.Still love my Sinful wins game ,could play that All day.the .', ""The updates definately did NOT improve the gaming experience. What a shame. Your game went from fun to frustrating. I loved relaxing at night with slotomania so I'm hoping your next update will be much better. 12/12/19 Thank you for your latest update.12/28/19 thank you. It's getting fun to play again!! 01-09-20 another good update!1/23/20 Thank you! Love the latest update! 2-06-20 Another fun update but I'm losing all my coins. Please make the losing stop!! Thank you for making the losing stop!"", ""Overall this game will become harder to win any substantial amount of coins. Been playing for 4 years and pretty soon you will notice 15 or 20 spins with no wins at all or if you are lucky enough to win a time or two you probably will not win as much as you are betting on just one spin. Sometimes it will even take coins from you. If you haven't played this game yet, do yourself a favor and dont. Thanks playtime."", ""It's hard to say anything new. I love these games! Two thumbs up!👍👍 These are the best set of games I have found. You will have big wins and lots of losses! Even though these are great games there are down falls too! Their limits into bonus games at my level are ridiculous but that's a downfall! Just enjoy😉"", ""I love this game very much. And I haven't complained about it a few different times. But anymore does new album. Every time I go to try to get The ace packages. I'll sit there and play the game Ace packages every single day most of the day and still not get an Ace Package lately, all I do is lose all my credits in point. Are used to be able to get billions of credits at a time and Play 4 days on that. Not anymore, and I still have not close one album yet."", ""Love the game but I wish y'all would fix the part of being like real slots games because I know 1 when you win you have a choice of playing or collecting and cash out you don't have to pay to break a bank but more games I been playing your game for weeks have all kinds of coins and money but I refuse to pay to get what I won on your slots be real people come on"", 'I used to enjoy playing this so much. It seems more and more the payouts are fewer, the bonuses and free spins are rare, and if you are not willing to spend a lot of money to keep playing, you can\'t keep playing. I had over 2 trillion in play money and it is gone in 25-30 minutes. I got free spins once in that time and no bonus games and no ""rings"" for the blast found either. I am not sure I even want to play anymore, thinking of uninstalling and finding another slot game after many years...', ""Just seems to me that the further I climb levels the harder it is to win any damn thing and I am not purchasing any more coins just to lose them faster than I can blink. I have spent a lot of money in the past and really - I find myself wondering why I have'nt uninstalled this game/app. It will be too bad if and when I decide to..."", 'in the beginning the game is fun and addictive but the more you level up the less coins you get. I get more pop ups to buy coins than I get wins. This is one of those free but pay to play games. It really takes the fun out of it. Lmao, love the reply from the company. Since then the game has gotten worst and I play far less than before. Again this is a pay to play game. No money, no wins.', ""Awesome game I love to play but i don't never get to gold I am on the silver right now and I would love if you'll can come up with fun bonuses and maybe then you will let me win more on the game. I thought this was a good game they stop giving me bonus games on all the games I play and that suck when you spend your money. That is why sometimes I really have to think hard whether or not to spend my money on these games because they be taking people money and I just spent some Friday and Satuday"", ""Would have rated 5 star back in 2019, but disappointed that there aren't as many ways of building up extra coins and slotto cards as there were in 2019. I think you should get an automatic free spin every 24 hours ( like when you could pick three of the xmas stockings every 24 hours). Also I liked logging in last year to take part in various activities with the heros, whereby you could win slotto cards and build up coins regularly several times a day in addition to bonus collection."", 'I\'ve been reading the comments and yes it\'s all random ""apparently"" well someone turned the dial down on the random because a lot of is are just loosing. Even if I buy coins I\'ll loose them too. So not doing it. Slotocards are impossible, completing a sloto quest to win a few billion doesn\'t really make sense considering you have to spend 100\'s of billions to win anything, that is if you win at all. I love this game that\'s why I\'m even saying anything at all. Hopefully you listen to the people.', ""I give 3 stars due to the graphics and game selection. Other than that, I am very displeased with slotomania and it's entirety. It used to be enjoyable, but now all it revolves around is purchasing this and that to be able to play. Some people like myself, live paycheck to paycheck & would like to play without the need to purchase. It is extremely aggravating and I am tired of spending my hard earned money just to make it past dashes, etc. I shouldn't have to buy anything to play. Nonsense!"", ""It is getting worse. Still too difficult to get cards. Can't play much before running out coins. Used to love it for years. Would play for hours and hours. The new changes are not still not entertaining. Don't mind losing if entertained. Really miss playing Slotomania all the time. Too bad things still aren't better. Very disappointed in Slotomania. At this point, I would not suggest it."", ""This game is really a money pit. I have spent hundreds of dollars on a game that doesnt pay back. I shouldn't even have to wait on bonuses to get more coins. It use to be fun. Now it just wants me to spend money. On my favorite slots it costs 25,000,000 coins for one spin. I get a little over 30,000,000 each time I collect the bonus. So I get 1 spin every 3 hours after spending enough money I could have bought several console games. Use to I would actually get on a little winning streak. No more"", 'I would like to tell you that I have played TRILLIONS of tokens for over a week now.....I have gotten NO NEW CARDS!!! Only duplicate cards! No 5 star cards!! I dont wanna hear that it is all luck!! That is B/S!! There is no way!! I have gotten HUNDREDS of Ace packs and THOUSANDS of cards....yet I get NONE OF THE ACE CARDS OR TRADEABLE CARDS I NEED?? THIS NEEDS TO CHANGE!! AND THAT IS MY REVIEW!!', 'Poor slot app at best. Lotto bonus ready in 1.day... I\'ve been seeing this for.the last 3 days...cannot make any progress in journey events without an astronomical amount of coins, which are only used for nothing it seems. So much more you could do with this app and choose not too. Makes me wonder which one you are more of: liars or thieves? After this ""slotoquest"" event, never mind.....it\'s clear that you\'re both!!!!', ""Keeps having glitches, do not get the rewards you win, lost billions in coins after it froze up and now the Daily Dash is not functioning properly. I can't even click on the Daily Dash, it is solid purple. Sent messages to playtika but nothing has ever been resolved. I even sent screen shots of previous problems including other new problems from yesterday. Now I'm not getting the Ballinko that I should have received with my Daily Dash."", '3 times in the last week I have purchased coin packages and they\'ve been added to my account. But after spending some of it!, it says ""oops something went wrong ""and then logs me off . When I logged back on the coins have diminished quite a bit. I\'ve emailed the company about my issues and was told the money was added. It was. I know. I told you that. Then it was suddenly GONE!!!! I\'m seriously thinking of deleting every casino app on my phone.', 'Love the new feature in ""snakes and ladders."" Percentage of coverage is large enough that you can see it. Kudos to your team. Please include this feature on the ""Sloto Quest"" feature as well. HAVING A GREAT TIME!!!!! Posted. 02/01/2020...On daily dashes the lack of cards is very frustrating to me. It makes me feel like quitting the daily dash. In fact I have done just that. Otherwise every thing else is great. Love the upgrades of the games and the graphics are much better.', 'Getting real tired of unrealistic goals in dashes. Today i had about 7 billion coins and my dash was to win 796 billion. Over 100 times what i had. This has been the norm lately not the exception. Im thinking of going to online poker instead. On my facebook , i see more people pissed off about this. Get real or get lost. Game no fun this way.', ""Negative stars will work. It has been almost a dozen times in the course of a couple months that I've been cheated out of my bonus games in the All-Star Christmas. When it stops spinning there's 3 bonus bags up but it keeps right on spinning (I always have it on auto spin) when I contact customer service I get asked for a screenshot, like I really have time for that. When I tell them I don't have one they tell me that they'll get right back to me & they're looking into it & never do. CHEATERS!!"", ""Well, I've been playing this game for about a year-and-a-half. I spent money after money after money. And yeah, I've been way way up there in coins. But now it takes me to bet 8 billion Coins just to win one dash and win 9 billion to win another daily dash. Okay, so tell me this I get 15 million coins every 3 hours. How in the hell are you going to win that much getting 15 million coins every 3 hours. And this new event now I've completed one set It's just getting worse and worse.."", ""About ready to give up and delete this app. Fun games and challenges when you are able to play the games. Payouts are few and far between. I understand slots are a game of chance with the odds going to the house but come on let a person win for a change and try to enjoy the experience you are trying to give us! Why have ace games if you dont give ace packets? I have played the ace game for several weeks with no ace packets given? Unless you spend money you really don't have a chance."", ""This game was really fun at first. But, the higher your level, the less (percent wise) you get. Packages that used to be 4.99 are now $29.99 or $34.99. why punish your loyal players? If you kept the prices low, I would buy them. I would smash my piggy bank for $5. Not for $20. Let's be more realistic. Not spending another dime on this game."", ""Absolute terrible play. I've been on 36% for days now in the clan......if you don't change these payouts I'm leaving. H Not fun at all. I've received two bingo cards and there is one day left to play. C'mon. I wait for my free coins to get some play but most of the time I'm hanging on by the skin of my teeth. Very frustrating. I'm not buying.......ever........ If I wanted to play for real money I would go on to another site where I have the chance to win money..... Really frustrating game play."", ""The slots on this game are tighter than a woman giving birth to her first with a twelve pound baby. It would be nice to play a game and win more. I like the games but there is almost no payout unless you hit a jackpot or the bonus. And even those are rare. I have spent way too much money to buy coins on this game and win as little as I have. And I don't bet high."", ""It's a great game a lot of fun. I spend a lot of time on it. I haven't bought anything yet. I just use the free coins. The other day. I was at the 315 million. And I lost it all within an hour. . This happened many times depends on when they want to. Let you win or let you lose one of the other. Up to them.""]"

Edit after response from Playtika UK: I have noticed an uptick in higher bonuses, which is helpful. I still find that the challenges are only winnable with purchases due to high qualifying bets. The higher dollar amount bonuses are nice though.', ""It's a very fun way to spend down time. The graphics are outstanding. Love the contest and payouts. Reasonable rates on purchases.Still having fun, you should give it a try. It has so many different games you should be able to find something you love too. Great start today 65 free games for 195,000 coins can't beat that. If they had 20 stars that's what I would give them. Frog game, love it. So not to long ago on one of the games I started winning big ended with 47 million. So I'm telling you I."", ""It's a good time passer. RNG in games is great. Free coins low, but spins and random gifts are superb. Free 100 spins, 20 a day? Doesn't work properly, 60 spins in 5 days so far. BUY COINS everywhere. Four buttons for it in main menu only. Every time you go to the menu, pop-up asks for money. No two step verification for purchase, straight away it prompts your CC. Misstapped? How sad. They fixed some issues in my first review, so kudos and higher rating from me."", ""Impossible to win and/or retain points. Side games like the 'Trip' are as exciting as watching paint dry....you would think you were going to win billions of points...but it's so little that it's not even worth playing!! BORING!!! Feb 2020..It's gotten worse!! Nothing but pop ups and coupons and gimmicks to get you to buy!! Inbox shows 9 items to collect when really there were 2 minimal amounts of coin to collect...the rest are Buy, Buy, Buy!! Time to uninstall !!"", ""when i first started playing this app i would have given it 5☆after several updates for the app now when i load it, it some times takes ages for the game to load, when playing a game it will suddenly stop then takes ages to load again or you have to close the app. winning minor, major or grand prizes in any game i've noticed they've become less and less and few and far between. i also think it should be the player who decides how much to bet per game and not you raising the minium bet to play."", ""I'm not a huge 'slots' fan but I don't mind playing a few spins here & there on 'HOF'. Pros: • Variety of slots to play. • Variety of 'mini' reward games. • Unlike some other slots, there's NO creeps trying to add you as a friend! • Reward links via FB & email. Cons: • Takes FOREVER to get balance built back up once it gets low.... it's annoying as I will NOT spend real money on any slot game! • Some in-game mini games require minimum bet to participate. Pointless playing them otherwise!"", ""So far so good. Just got app yesterday and got no bonuses, scatters, nothing. So played for about 20 mins and was broke. Today...different story. Lots of wins and will have some fun. I'm not asking for everything free. I get how you make money. Just I went broke so fast didn't have time to figure out if I liked it."", ""Awesome, fun for the whole family. Great entertainment. Great games!!!!!Playing everyday. Great!!! Can't put the phonedown. Wonderful!!! what an experience $$$ Marvelous, having a great time. The games are always changing for the best. I am enjoying it at all times of the day. Games continue to entertain and amuse. Definitely 6 stars.keeps getting better & better"", ""Too many pop ups. Mobile is better than web version but not by much. There's even a pop up telling me the previous challenge has ended, and that lasted an entire week. Good variety of games but most very tight. Very hard to find one you can play on without losing quickly. Lots of fun challenges but most too long and too difficult, and most come with multiple pop ups every time you load site. Too frustrating to enjoy."", 'Its ok. There ""Big win"" is usually only equal to 10 spins. And then they want you to update your review. And it constantly pops up saying you should increase your bit. And if you want any of the other stuff going on like cards or trophies . . . . Well the amount to play is WAY to much. They pretty much have it set-up so you get 5 mins of free play. Anything more than that cost. Sorry but I\'m not going to pay for fake money. We have real casinos for that. Same still', ""HOF games are fun but I'm not enjoying it much as I did when I first began playing HOF. I play the Daily Rush game, the challenge, it is in 3 stages. The first one is fine but HOF doesn't tell us how to play the 2nd one which I never completed. I've tried writing support twice but never heard back from them. House of Fun, please be kind to those who play the game."", ""Listen I would be lying to say I am not going to play on HOF, but I don't like the fact that once you get so far in the challenges they have the present box and completed stages come up and you can't finish the whole challenge there is always one stage or card or store you get far really far and spend the rest of your time trying to get that one thing. Come on guys make it fair ."", ""I like it we'll. The games are interesting. Plus, I like that I'm able to make extra coins by watching videos. The extra activity on the side like the genie one. Gives me the desire to keep spinning. So you go guys. Still Loving it. You deserve my rate yet again. Keep up the good work. One thing tho. I made a mistake saving the coins in the bank. Cannot see anything without my👓. I really don't want to spend money to get it out. Bummer out.😞"", 'Out of all the slot games ive played, this one is definitely one of the worst. I playes every single slot that was availible to me, and from that I can say the payouts in this game are ridiculously low. I hit the whole board, and only got enough to spin like 6 more time? Really? ""Big Win"" literally means nothing in this game, you dont get enough to do anything, and thanks to that even if you\'re on a winning streak you\'re still losing way more chips than you\'re making.', ""great! lots of fun!!! MY favorite game! Love the graffics ! I play all day till I run out of coins! I know it is a game of chance but the coins aren't enough to keep playing. I'm upset that some games I worked to unlock are locked now why? I don't think that is fair.I'm still gonna play till I'm broke!"", 'I am writing another review with an update. It seems like no matter how much money you spend you cannot get ahead in this game and it is a waste of money.there are times that you can go on major win streaks but they are very far and few between and since I am in such a high my qualifying bets are so high for the in-game challenges that it makes it impossible to keep any amount of. I am on level 1680 and the qualifying bet for every in-game challenge is well over a million coins.', ""Fun! Fun! Fun! A lot of different games to choose from. Some of the games have goofy names or silly music but they bring the fun. Oh! Loyalty is rewarded. HofF is my new favorite game. Thanks, HofF! Good job on the updates, and terrific problem solving. I can't recall the last time I had customer service send a message telling me what happened. Wow! That's about all I can say... Wow! I'm a fan!"", ""best games! play every day! love HOF but wish the collections were more as the betting amounts are too high for the money you get every three hours. I only get a few spins and then have a long wait for more. we can't all afford to buy! Still enjoy playing and free coins have been increased somewhat! Four stars now! would like to give five stars but everytime I win big its taken straight back.cant always be just bad luck!"", ""I've been playing for over 3 months usually daily. Great games, I got started with a free 1,000 and I have not had to buy anything. I just keep collecting the free points and I win enough to keep playing. I bet low maybe that's why I never have to buy anything and I haven't had any issues collecting anything. The only downside is that they lock up the games I like and I can't figure out if you have to pay to play them again or not but I can usually find another one I like."", ""I've been playing this game now for longer than I can remember and it's still as enjoyable all these many, many, many months later as it was when I first downloaded it and started playing. There's always something cool and rewarding everyday they're posting (i.e. coins and prizes) to collect daily. Love this game a lot more than some of the others I've played 😎😆😉"", ""Win % is horrible One would think to keep one interested bonus games with be easier to hit. 2/18/20 Update: i wouldn't spend 1 cents on app. The gummy slot, i must of spun over a thousand times already and not 1 time got the bonus wheel, not once. And almost every spin 2 wheels come up, never the third. And the reply from my first review is ridiculous. Like id post a review off 1 or 2 games. In fact i dont give reviews unless extremely good or horribly bad."", ""Downloaded as part of an offer wall. It's part casino and part mini games. Instead of just virtual currency, you also win assorted prizes toward mini games, that then pay out in game currency. By restricting your winnings they hope you'll spend actual money. You can earn free coins daily but it will take forever to earn the reward the offerwall made in the first place. If you just want a casino game, there are better ones out there. As a random distraction, this is fun enough."", ""Just started to kill some time lost all my chips super fast with in minutes so game didn't kill much of my free time I had. Maybe I was really unlucky or it's set up for you to lose fast either way you start with next to nothing for chips to try out the site. Unless your willing to spend cash on a site before you even know if you like it. I'm for one not willing to. Lucky there are lots of different sites these days so I will try a different one and hope it's better."", ""Very challenging slots very entertaining each slot is an Adventure. Never a dual moment with HOF. I find myself so entertained at times that I don't even realize that hours have gone by. For many hours of great fun House of Fun is the way to go! Fantastic fun. But once you start prepared to be addicted to the fun.!!!!!!!"", 'the game itself is enjoyable and rewarding if you remember it is a game and sometimes in games you lose. What is most important is the support I received when I ran into some serious issues with my account. the HoF team were respectful of my situation and helped as much as they could to remedy the problem. Thanks team, you made a difficult situation easier to handle. nothing to change. still having fun', ""2.6.20 Update As a Promo Game offers Free spins (10) but only at 150. I win a whole 259. According to Customer Support it is Supposed to be average of play which in my case is always Max Bet..225k or above. CS said fixed but just got 10 at 150. Was 5 Stars but now 1 Star. Developer sent me a gift but I can't collect it because review gets smaller. They don't even read the reviews. If they did I wouldn't still have the problem."", 'Need to stop with the god damn ad pop ups at every opportunity. I just log in and 6 in my face. Very slow going getting g coil s without paying has good games yet ads and low payouts at low bets make getting anywhere a grind. Theres apps like this one that literally give you half a million on a spin of the day that will keep you going on a decent while. This game requires you log in every 3 hours if you wanna get free coins', ""I have a loyal NFL player for years and I'm Highly dissatisfied with the play of HOF anymore!!!!! The last few months I have play I have had no play and have spent not millions but Billions of coins and nothing to show for it . Not even any enjoyment out of playing. The challenges suck, unless you spend thousands of dollars you can't win at any of them. HOF you should be ashamed!!!"", ""use to love this game but now it's all about spending money and you don't really win anything anymore. I've spent more money than I'd like to admit and I've gotten nothing for it!!! I wrote the first half about 2 months ago and it's starting to get a little better with more winning and payouts. Thank you and I hope you continue to make it better!! So I continued playing and the more I maximized my bet the more I won and I ended up winning a Grand Jackpot. Thank You So Much HOF"", ""This is probably one of the worst slot machine games first of all you hardly ever win the free spins that they give you hardly payout anyting. The free coins they give you are going within a few spins if you're lucky. So unless you buy coins you will hardly ever get to play the game. The slot games they have look like they're really fun but you never win!!! At least I never win anything even half way decent. I just had 30 free spins and I only one around 900 credit. That's pathetic!!!"", ""Don't like new set up, I know for a fact I bought over 150 dollars on card game and on the rare ones out of ten packs of gold sets only one rare card. I have never finished ANY CHALLENGE/ LEGENDS IN 4 years. Never. Note to self.... Never buy from them again. Sucker across my head. Never again. I was promised rare cards but only 1 in 150.00 dollars worth. I only closed 5 out of 10."", 'I am a long playtika diamond player and I love this game. I wish the free froggie games were like they used to be. The only draw back with house of fun is the free coin amounts. Most slot games once you reach my level of over 770 you are getting millions but here my amount is 3,500. My free gifts from friends is even lower. The games are fun but do not plan on billions because this game is not like that. Despicable critters is by far the best game. I hope the coins will go up one day.', ""House of Fun Casino slot machines has real looking slot machines. I think some of the casinos have these Slot machines in the showrooms. So if you really like slot machines, this is the game for you. Makes you feel like you're at the casino. This is a very fun app to play. I like this game. ."", ""I have been playing HOF games a lot lately and I have purchased a lot of suitcases in the last games. What I'm trying to understand...with that many purchases I should have visited every country on that board before my time runs out. I still enjoy playing. As of today I still like playing the majorjty of my day. I still like playing HOF games every day. Have fun. I like how every game have its own unique bonus"", 'I use to like this app but not only has it gotten harder to win coins but it glitches and freezes constantly. Worst part is when I contacted support. I was completely blown away by the way I was treated. He was clearly insinuating that I was making up what happened. He said I needed proof of what happened. I was only trying to make them aware of the issue and he was acting like I was trying to scam him out coins or something. He was pretty rude.', ""Been playing this game for one week. I can say that it's different from any other slots game that I played. It's my first time in almost 6 years of playing slot games (and I play alot and spend lots of money on slot games) that I ever won a jackpot. This game doesn't force you to pay to play and the fun part is the bonuses that the game gives to players apart from the slot machines."", ""I like the game haven't had much time to play. I don't vin anything like it shows in the ADS . I'm new at this . I don't mind the ADs if there different ones gives me time to relax my eyes get a drink and a cigarette. And strech my body and come back to what ever level I'm on . Sometimes the same videos play over and over . Now if and when u let me win real cash or merchandise I can then buy something . Being on a fixed income very low income???? Lol., Makes it hard to buy anything for myself."", 'This game is geared towards wasting your money more than most in the slots genre. You will win and get huge bonuses, then the rate this game comes up, then after you will straight lose with no bonuses in sight. And then surprise, the same thing will happen. After three days of the same pattern, this game is nothing but trash.', 'So a good slot machine and what you would expect to play at a casino has a payout percentage of a round 90% and if it is as little as 85% it is a terrible slot and should never be played. After spending a lot of time on the house of fun app and website I can find no written list of payout amounts on the slots they have but based my math the best payout of any of the games unlocked up to level 50 is around 65%. That is basically robbery. Most games pay back your bet or more only 10-15% of spins.', 'Great app so far, but like many other apps we are asked to rate too soon. It has the potential to be a good app, the dynamic seems really smooth and I do like the fast or slow options for reel spin. I can only hope there is a club option. Or to play with other players.']"

Well it never did. I still play the game though. Keep on gaming peeps .', 'The app freezes up, especially when a big prize is in the process of being credited, causing me to lose tokens. Also everytime you return to the casino to play a different game you have to decline a series of 3 offers to either buy more tokens or to play some challenge type activity.

If you're into spending cash for virtual coins, go for it."", 'I give 2 stars, my reasoning for 2 stars is because when you are playing BINGO and you accidentally tap the home button it\'ll take you straight to the homepage and if you\'re in the middle of a BINGO game hitting it BIG, you try to go back into the game and you have to start a whole new game... You guys need to present the option for ""YES or NO"" when someone accidentally taps the home button, you\'re basically taking coins from us...

I have contacted support, but no answers there really. Game is unplayable on my device now."", ""It's fun and looks nice. I don't like the different voices and accents, it's difficult to understand some numbers. It gets laggy when many people have bingo at once. The controls suck for playing 4 cards at once (when pressing bingo, it thinks you are pressing the arrow and moves you to the top/bottom screen) also, not sure why are the arrows flashing constantly?! The symbols (gold and B coins, and the one for bonuses) are so confusing, took me a while to figure it out."", 'I have been playing this game for so long but I have become so angry with it today that I am done playing.

Unfortunately I don't get to play it for awhile because of the lack of credits now"", ""This game is definitely entertaining but play time is very limited unless you're willing to spend a LOT of money, especially as you level up.

It actually makes it nearly impossible as you don't get new items."", 'I don\'t like this bingo game. There\'s way too much going on and I hate that if I switch between the cards I accidentally push ""bingo"" and it sais bad call. I like the solution in bingo journey a lot better where you switch the cards on the left side.

I've been waiting a long time to move up in the VIP rm. But years later I'm still not past the gold level. I'm guessing the only people who win anything r those who have plenty of money to put out on this game.. It really sucks to think after all the year's I'm ready to give it up"", ""The new update completely sucks. You can only send 20 gifts. What's the point of having 100 friends? They didn't get much in the first place. The huge tiles for gift spins suck and you can't delete any so you need to scroll past maybe 20 or 30 to get to the one you want to play. Leave a good thing as is. Just another needless update and they made it cheaper for THEM."", 'Obvious ad watching setup. Constantly lose everything even at lower than reasonable bets so that you have to watch ad to get coins again. This gos on and on until you cant watch ads anymore and the shop pops up. For some reason, every spin you do on any machine has an ANNOYING lag/hang up at the end of EVERY spin. Its enough to make you go insane.

So dumb that you can only give 2 gifts and only help 2 people. I loved the old way. Because of this I do not play as often.', ""The regular slot games are fantastic! The periodic side games especially Quest for the Chest are useless. They are a major distraction while you were trying to play the regular slots. And they don't pay anything. All they do is constantly interrupt you while you were trying to play . You should allow an opt-out on these irritating promo games"", 'Giant Jackpot is my favorite. All games are great. When you get lucky you win billions.', ""Not happy with the new changes to coins and helping others. Also don't like how games are lagging and skipping so much. I gave up playing anymore."", ""I won first place in weekly race 2 weeks ago and the bonus was a joke. I now get 150% of my hourly spin. But 3.58 X 150% is a joke. I am starting to hate this game.

I have taken note of the fact that almost Everytime I have had a winning streak, inevitably I am asked to rate them, not once have I been asked to do so while losing. They have quests, unfortunately I have finished very few, simply because to finish you need to make a purchase. I no longer will buy coins from my favorite, hit it rich, simply because I lose even faster after a purchase. Enjoy it as I have with your eyes wide open.', ""Overall, this is a fun experience. Like most, it sucks you in with early wins before it tightens up. The winning seems fair and balanced. The variety is great, and I love the log in bonuses. However - it does not tie in to Google Games, so I'm afraid to make any purchase. They want a Facebook log in, and I don't use Facebook anymore. It's 2020. Time to get away from that garbage."", ""Good play and regular wins, however they don't reward you much for winning against rivals in slot tournament. Took 900 million points to win and my winnings where only about 1.5 million l"", ""One thing I don't like is that after friends give you free bonus spins for extra points, the app limits greatly how many you can spin. Then they expire them before allowing you a chance to play them. Otherwise, there is a good selection of games to choose from. Fun to play and also an hourly chance to spin the wheel for free points."", ""I don't like the long period of time quest for the chest runs. 2 to 3 days is plenty. Need more free spins."", 'Love this app!!!! I play this game many times throughout the day. I will not the challenges but wish that the rewards were greater.', ""I hate that you can't win anything in this stupid casino. I had stayed up all night to get 30 min bonus to only come to almost 500 million which I started at 200 million. when done I played 5 million a spin and lost it all in 15 minutes! I have dropped a level because all my hourly spins were under 3.75. You can't win and I see the same people winning jackpots. I'm tired of having to spend all day collecting bonuses to lose it in minutes no matter what slot I play. I have uninstalled cheaters! T"", ""Rewards are not even worth mentioning they are so bad so so so bad it just goes to show you where loyalty gets you!! Can't believe the bonuses have even gotten worse not worth collecting!!! Nothing has changed, the games are a blast but they steal your money!! If you have money to give away play these games..."", ""Love the game but goes in streaks. Once you win alot, you start a losing streak. Takes a while to build back up. Challenges have too high of money wins. Hard to complete. My stars keep going down. Challenges are shorter and very unrealistic unless you buy coins. I play for fun and it's not S much fun anymore."", ""I think the games are biased to players that purchase points. Yes we have games that do good but games that are frequently played have far to many losses. Long spells without a win or bonus win . Especially after a good run of wins. It's an attempt to make players have to make a purchase to continue playing."", ""Not only your don't get bonuses that much collecting and free bonus games they cut out the amount on daily allowed to only a few this game is sucking more everyone u update it."", ""My pet peeve is Rich Collection. I didn't get a new card over a month- all duplicates and it's irritating. The challenges are not well balanced - they seem endless, the requirements are high but rewards are low, not really worth playing. Overall gets boring recently. I guess I'll wait till the game improves."", ""ABSOLUTELY HATE the update to the gift box. Now I can't remove the free spin gifted games that I do NOT wish to play like I could before the update. Please fix that."", 'Too slow for free Be ready to play if you want to advance any amount in this game, the freebies will not be enough to get tasks accomplished, you have to bet beyond what you can win, not a bargain even by Vegas standards. If you are not buying the $99.99 package each month forget trying to finish their tournaments.', ""The reels don't run smooth. And when there is a special going don't expect to get anything out of it, like the Quest for the Chest. You can spend billions of coins and get nothing. And you are limited on the amount of gifts and free spins and if you don't collect them in time they take them from you. Lower levels are only allowed 2 free spins a day from friends. Higher levels around 500 are only allowed 6 free spins.""]"

The party doesn’t start until you walk in … let’s start spinning!","[""Looking for a GAME to have fun and pass the time? Well look no further! This game totally makes sense to drop money into and offering nothing in return! It's almost like going to the casino and throwing your money away, but with absolutely zero chance of winning actual money back!! Since I'm not putting any money in here, I LOVE getting on game once every hour and getting my ONE free spin at the minimum bet and not win anything, and if I do, it's usually not enough for a second spin. TONS of fun"", 'Over and over I will show 5 across and game pays for first 3 reels, and only sometimes 4. On rare occasions will it pay the 5. But that is rare. Same is true for wild cards. Time and again two wilds above each other on same reel and game only notices one. Had five nines and five jacks on the same spin and not been paid! Easy to see because graphics are pretty sad for a slot machine game. The usual pay schedule is every other spin a winner at first to 1 in 15 after an hour. Frustrating ""game"".', ""Great graphics and fun to play, only downfall is that you go through a lot of coins. However, the only way you're going to keep playing, is to purchase coin packages. In the month of January my total purchase for coins were over $200. And the coin packages that you purchase don't last long!! Double Down and House of Fun are much more fun to play at this time, doesn't suck your coins, just to buy more."", ""Lots of different games to play. Have hours of fun!! Plenty of bonus games and HUGE WINS!!! Plus some of my favorite games are coming back, like the locking hearts. Where you get 3 in a row and they keep spinning as long as they connect!!! YESSSSSS!! The only drawback is the different levels like rookie, beginner etc. You can go up and down with that!!! That's the only reason I gave 4 stars."", ""This has to be the worst game ever!!!! 😠 I claim the free points so I can play and within a few minutes they are gone. No bonuses no matter which game I play. You guys changed this game so much. Our party prizes aren't ours anymore. We can only open 1 at a time and the prizes suck. I played the bingo to get 1 line and it took 52 balls. Honestly, fix your game cause I have paid money to play this game and you won't be getting anymore from me!!!!"", ""When I first installed this game I liked it, I've spent $10.00 on the game. I have zero coin, if this is P2W, fine, but i did spend money and $10.00 should be enough for me to win enough coin and keep my balance until level 50!! A proper P2W game gives you wins and then you risk more, no one likes to be taken for their money. And that is exactly what this game feels like."", ""This is a slot machine with various games with a minimum High bet. You blow through coins to purchase more. At least when people go to a casino they're playing to get something in return for blowing through coins like you do. This game offers nothing in return. Sure it passes the time. But I've played better."", 'out of all the casino apps I have, your games run the smoothest. I really like the jackpot party game, it was my favorite in Atlantic City too! Update: Your games just keep getting better! Thank you! I still stand by my previous review. I love your games! Of course, with you constantly adding new games, my favorite keeps changing! Thank you! Still love your games. Your app is the only casino app on my phone!', 'like the majority of slot games, it gives you coins then takes them away hoping you\'ll spend real money on ""play money"".....there is no way it\'s supposed to ""realistic"" like a real casino. I didn\'t think it was possible, but a year later and this game is worse now than it was. Here\'s a free tip....IT\'S A GAME...GAMES SHOULD BE FUN', ""I thought it may of been different to the others but it's just the same. It's a game to kill time and have fun but it gives you no wins and just want you to spend real money to keep playing. If I want to spend money I may as well.go to the club and at least have a chance to win real money. Another pokie game uninstalled... bye bye"", ""I really like the game and they have good coin packages. I don't like the fact so many of the fun games are high limit. I also think that the only way to play for a good amount of time is if you buy coins and that's it. Can't seem to win enough to keep playing very long. I might end up deleting if that's the case cause it would just get too expensive. We will see. Great graphics and games though which is why I still give it a 5"", ""Jackpot Party Casino has been my favorite game app so far! It is also the only app that remains on my phone since the day I installed it. I play it every chance I get. There are many ways of obtaining free coins which allows me plenty of time to enjoy playing longer than other casino games I've tried. I don't recall ever having any technical problems while playing the game or any issues with my phone after installing this app. My advice is to check it out for yourself and enjoy JPC for FREE! 👍"", ""Fun game, but there isn't enough options to get free coins, you run out of your first initial free coins you receive when you start playing the game. when you start the game way too fast so you have to spend money in order to keep playing so if there were more options to get free coins the game of be at five star games in my opinion."", 'I have been playing for a while now and I enjoy the variety of the games. I rate it 5 stars. Still having fun! Try to play every day. Wish the Eureka Reels game with the 6 dynamite feature could be a permanent game. Still rate it 5 stars. I play some every day. Eureka Reels Blast still my favorite. 5 stars! Still playing Jackpot Party and love it! You had a game on for a short time called Empire Legend and I really liked it. Please bring it back if you can. I still rate the app 5 stars!', ""With me being unable to do certain things, I am able to play Jackpot Party Casino games. Keep up the great work, you've got my attention. I really enjoy Jackpot Party, but I must say that when trying to purchase points, the costs are really high. I wish that the costs were a bit less, because I am on a fixed budget, but I do enjoy the games."", 'Great games but being locked into set games for league points gets a bit boring. Minimum bet is a bit high on some games and it is hard to get features. Party prizes are great feature but if you are trying to complete daily tasks you have no choice but to accept smallest prizes. A lot of great games that are hard to find in the real gambling world now,. Daily wheel spin could be higher compared to other on line slots. Really like jackpot party despite these comments.', ""Great graffics, lovely clear vibrant colours and some great games, my only moan is that the lowest bet is very high, I think the lowest one that I've played is 54,000, it don't last very long so you have to wait until the next day for the daily bonus etc to play again, at one point I actually got to about 70,000,000 but the bet increased on it's own and I was down to about 23,000,000 before I noticed it so I was really mad lol, it took hours to get that high and I lost it in like 3 spins aaarr."", 'This game is good as far as slots games go but I am not personally interested in slots games. I only downloaded and played it to earn credits in another game. I may still play even after the reward is given in the other game if there is a cheap way to get coins after running out.', ""The worst game experience I've ever had, 2 thumbs way down, pay to play but won't get my money, losing 20 times in a row is not my idea of fun. Spend 48,000 credits to win 6,000 back? Then get free spin bonus and all ten spins produce zilch and that happened twice in a row. Your games are manipulated and rigged worse than a real casino. There are way too many losing games connected to this app. 5 million credits gone in seconds betting bare minimum, observation is rigged games, no question"", ""I like the puzzle you have to get through every day to make your progress to get your big price on Saturdays to open your chest it is fun sometimes it's hard sometimes it's easier depends on which games you depend on playing and which ones win them which ones don't you have to play enough to get the excitement out of the game and that you get coins every hour and the new update makes it easier to see."", ""Real world odds of winning a prize more than your bet. Cleos treasures is a complete waste of time, but daily achievements are rewarding. Poor daily spin wheel considering most slots require 60k to spin (3 or 4 spins and your done) unless you buy coins. Support was helpful telling me that there game is a pay to play (win) game. If you don't buy your not going to get very far and probably uninstall it. Slot music is repetitive. Would rate it higher star if it was fair to non coin buyers too."", ""I play the jackpot party slot and it doesn't pay the same as the REAL slot game also the less people playing the less they let you win, I'm done spending real money on this game, it doesn't let you win much at all, it should since it's just a game, I can go to a casino and win real money easier than this game. You shouldn't have to spend hundreds and hundreds of real money just to be able to keep playing a game."", 'I do see what people mean about this game. Won 40 mil coins, lost it all without ever winning anything back in a matter of minutes. And these honey to do lists? Yeah dont waste your time. Winning a party prize is a lot more difficult I less you just want to keep putting money into this game.', 'Yeah im having Fun but u need to bring back the mushroom game back permitley. I love that game i dont really care for the other ones n u have all ur games locked why thats no fun . theres a lot in there i wouldnt mind checking out. Oh yeah there is one more issue ur games eat more coins faster then anthing one min. U got coins the next min. There gone. Ive played a lot of games but come on i should be credited for it . sharon', 'Game payouts are so so so little. Its funny really! You cant play this game longer than a day unless you buy fake money with real money. Understanding you cant always win is one thing but if your betting real high and do win.. Come on, dont pay out pennies and have bonuses that dont make you excited to get because it wont give you anything to brag about. Id be willing to buy a pack or too if you guys were not so stingy with rewards.', ""I have play this app for free for years. It is a free app in apple store. Then all of the sudden the publisher of the game charged my credit card $ 24.99. It's not right to charge someone for a free app, especially without your knowledge.

Check for yourself."", ""Well ...got up to 8 billion credits and was enjoying myself but with all the leveling up constantly and the ever so annoying raffle dice thing appearing every spin it's seriously annoying and interrupts game play.

I loved this game when I first started playing it. However, they dont like to credit coins when purchase's are made. Was told it showed on their end it went through, So we can do it this once. And never again. I suggest making the smallest of purchases to guarantee your getting what you paid for."", ""This game is awful. The daily spin always gives a low amount, the bonus wheel never gives anything good even after spinning it over 100 times. When bonuses or free spins are triggered (very infrequently) you end up with little or nothing. Always pestering you to buy coins all the time, almost as bad as slotomania.

After all that time and money, I\'m only at level 212, (and not going up anytime soon), and there\'s over 500 levels.

Games never pay out or hit the bonus. And I purchase coins.', ""I like the fact that I can play the real life slots and not just made up games. But, this game tends to lose connection right after you get a big win, which causes it to take the jackpot you just won and refund what you bet before the jackpot. It's happened more times than i could even keep track of, I just finally decided to change my review. Beware of this if you are deciding wether you should spend real money on this game or not."", 'Would enjoy playing game more if was available for offline playability. Besides that, enjoy the experience I have from playing the game.', ""Off and on this game and the game play has been slowly getting better and more enjoyable, overall this is one of the better realistic slot games. I do recommend this one for those who are wanting a to play their favorite games while being a bit more patient with the fact that you can win and lose, and not be entitled to crazy payouts. I know it's frustrating with some games when all of the time you are playing at a loss, but as I said before this game seems to be improving it's win-loss ratio."", 'This game is the best i have ever played i mean it could give bonuses more often but overall its a really good game.', ""Love the Quick Hit slots however the daily start up cash spins don't give you much should you want to play awhile."", 'Awesome graphics!

Most of the app is fun and can feel real. Personally, I dont like all the extras- dragon feeding (you dont have to be farmville, etc), plant watering, magic chest collecting is too much for me. I get the ads (you should get paid) but I dont like how the promo stuff interrupts the game play. I dont like keeping track of what I have to do (?!) and it's a rea"", ""I reach out to support regarding game stop working more than week ago but only response I got was clear date and cache but that never worked. my screen freeze soon as game open and shows loading symbol. I use galaxy s10+ and I thought maybe only I was having issue but I asked someone who has note 10+ to open that app and it won't work for him too. I use my time and money on this game and this bs treatment I get. not acceptable."", 'This is such an amazing app! Most slot games get boring after awhile and I then uninstall them. But Caesars Slots are always exciting! Raise a Dragon or plant a garden and help Isabella and Tyana with the kingdom and so much more to do and receive tons of coins along the way. I have been playing for a few years and I am always entertained and never bored! Fun and exciting and the graphics are gorgeous! The games have an array of bonuses that are cute and a blast of fun! A must download!', ""So fun and addicting. If there weren't so many pop ups I would probably give it 5 stars. But every time you get out of a game there are 2 or 3 pop ups before you can even get to the lobby. You guys are just begging for money. Then if I do buy more coins it seems that the games don't pay out as much. They just keep eating up all my money. Just like all the other games. It's all good though, I still enjoy Caesars Slots the most"", ""It's just like all the other slot apps that are designed to steal your money. You'll start off winning and winning and winning more! Then, for no reason, you'll lose every spin, every slot until you have no coins. Guess what, for X amount of money, you can play again, how convenient! Then you'll win again for a bit, then tank again until you're at zero coins again, repeat process. Dont waste your time or money. Play Pop Slots instead, much better win ratios and such."", ""Hi. I had complained that this game doesn't open now. I'm on 730+ level. But now it doesn't open from so many days. And I had suggested that I shud contact support team option given at the right corner of the game screen. Can u tell me how can I open it when the game doesn't open at all. I had emailed also. Worst game to ask for help. Wats the use of wasting so much money on this game when it's not opening from so many days. And u guys r doing absolutely nothing about it. 😡😡😡"", ""Very fun to play. My absolute favorite slot game. I spend 18 hour a day playing when I can. However I feel like it would be beneficial if it gave players a warning that you are about to spend all your money on one spin. Especially when it's a max bet. Too many times I spend with days collecting coins to play just to start playing and accidentally waste it all in one spin. One accidental max bet spin that has never ever let me win....is always a losing spin then I'm out of money again..."", ""I really enjoy playing this game! No it's not perfect, but none of them are!It's a game, it's a great game, I suppose it the machines resemble the slots in Vegas, I wouldn't know, never been and this app will be the closest I will ever be to Vegas! The graphics are GREAT! and Glitches are few and far between! Keep up the awesome job y'all are doing!!"", ""I'm mixed. As a slot game it's 4 of 5 stars. Graphics could be more realistic. Now the wipe credits out bug is annoying. You give like 75,000 credits a day. I won a x3 spin. I was racking up. Then crashed. I'm back to 24,000 credits. I just started playing. So I would give it 2 stars. Game seems more like it's beta stage. But it's still fun."", ""Love the slots. BUT In the short time I've been back, around 3hours i paid for two lots of coins, i have tested this several times lately & I've come to the same conclusion, the more coins you buy the worse the games perform, maybe there will be the occasional free spins to keep you interested & as your coins go down up pops the buy buy buy ads, & if you are broke like me, your playing time is doomed. I am an elderly person on a fixed budget & although i love to play, i simply can't afford to."", 'Ups and downs but mostly downs. This is a game and should not be programmed just like real slots in a casino. There should be some give in this game. Specially since you sell coins to us that are free to create out of thin air for you. To charge so much for coins and then have it play like a casino machine does not equal fun when there is zero chance for us to win any money back. So slacking back the house always wins to the house breaks even would be to your advantage. + players, less groaning.', ""I am enjoying the games so much . There are so many challenges to win lots of credits. The only problem I have is that I cannot get to support cos I have a problem that the level up credits does not get added to my total credits and I am loosing a lots of coins. Otherwise I am extremely happy everything. So much of excellent games to choose from. I am recommending this to all my friends to like to play slot games. Please ask support to sort out my problem. Thank u it's great."", 'A lot of fun games, each with unique features. Gets a little ""busy"" sometimes, with ads or ""buy me-s"", but its a great gaming app, highly recommend... After some time playing though, I am frustrated over the ""control"" of the games. Midnight Chimes is boring and un-winnable. My previous review has eroded to a deep dissatisfaction. I guess you think if you take 3 billion of my winnings, I\'ll happily buy more coins. I\'ll wipe this game from my phone first.', ""Loved this game, but lately it's as though there aren't any good winning runs anymore. It's all lose, lose, lose, and buy more and more coins. I was really enjoying it, but as soon as I started spending money on coins and packages it was all lose, lose, lose! It took all of the fun out of it! It was fun in the beginning, but if you spend money you'll watch the fun dissipate as you'll continually need to spend more and more money. Great gimmick to get people in the door."", ""Terrible Experience....tired of having to play moronic board games! Feed a disgusting dragon!!!..... I just want to play slots. Stop with all the other junk like collecting symbols that never pay off. Please at least give us the ability to opt out of the side show games! I am getting to the point I won't be back unless the nonsense stops!"", ""I really like playing all the different games. Lately Ive noticed that I'm not getting all my points or coins I won either on scatters or bonuses but it takes all the coins I already had. I tried reporting this, I can't get through to anyone. Id like my coins back and the ones I don't get at all."", 'Keeps Crashing I own a Google Pixel Slate and this app keeps crashing, the video is glitchy and the the images are oversized and stretches past the screen and no way to change resolution to fit screen. Previously I had a Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 and the screen on my Slate is the same size and did not have a problem with the Note Pro .... I have contacted the this app maker about the issue and of course no response... terrible service....', 'Program spoils the exitment of winning at slots many times by giving away the results before the reels spin. Extra games are geared to take your coins. Many times games like pearl in shell failed to work when you meet the requirements leveling up. You have no one to contact to complain. Would not spend money to play this app.', ""I love Caesars Casino. They have great games, generous bonuses, many interesting challenges, and a great support team. But they do have one fault. If you play on your desktop computer then you have Express Bonus, but if you play on your tablet you don't. Other casinos keep everything the same it dosen't matter what platform you're playing on. I like to see everything the same."", 'When I first started playing this game I thought it was fun then it all changed now it is all about how much money you can use on it just like all of the UK playtica games. When are you people going to quit ripping your players off and just let them enjoy the game for once. If I had known it was from UK playtica I would not have down loaded this game.', "":::::UPDATED 2/15/20::::: They seem to fix the pop up problems, I still get pop ups but the normal range. I like this game and wanted to give it another go. I haven't been asked to purchase anything since the other issues THANK YOU FOR LISTENING TO YOUR CUSTOMER BASE AND ADDRESSING THESE ISSUES This game used to be fun, now they have way too many pop up ads and these pop up games are getting terrible can't make it 3 spins before it's trying to take me to extra games to try and sell me spins."", ""In order to play things like 4 kingdoms, feed the dragon etc... you need to bet a minimum of 13,500,00 but you get an hourly bonus of far less than that. in order to play games you need to collect for several days. they take your coins for no reason. i had over a trillion coins go back to play and i have only a couple million. They make up stories. They don't want to help you.they just want you to give them money. Your odds of winning anything are slim to none. almost time to delete this game."", 'Give this game a shot! Lots of fun ! But I Was on a Winning Streak for a good while so my Bets were High ! Now that Im Coin Broke,they dont Realize Im not at that Playing level anymore ! I cant particapate in Contests to win Chests! I cant bet 500million plus a spin! Please take into concideration that I cant always bet that high I still go on everyday to Collect daily Bonuses and Give Gifts to all my friends and I Still VERY MUCH ENJOY Caesars ! I just cant play as much !', 'The games can be fun, hitting big wins fairly regularly & building up coins. Then it seems like a trap if u get caught up trying to accomplish the side challenges. The games keep coaxing you to bet bigger & bigger to complete challenges, at which point it seems like a switch is hit on the games that locks out the bonuses from triggering for disturbingly long periods of time, killing your bankroll. Not to mention how easy it is to accidently misclick & bet way more than u meant to.', ""first time on here I was a little irritated when trying to log back in ..i don't like to complain but I noticed a email and decided to try it again lol but it felt like they were rite there making sure I able to log Iin a play the games.thank you guys.. still playing. Made it almost the way to the top if there is just like real slots most days you lose but very fun when you win"", ""Ive been playing for almost a year and haven't missed a day without playing it.

I really recommend. even though I've had my ups and downs with this app the customer service always seems to help with your problem. thanks guys."", ""It's a decent app. I just realized I was doing something wrong an missing out on extra money. This game is alot like real life slots. Random generation on spins. It is by luck I guess. It would be nice if we could earn real money. Wheres the penny machines?? Lol"", ""I have been getting some decent wins and some pretty big losses, but this is still my favorite casino, I'm back again I played a lot of games trying to win the latest quest and fell 2 short, but it was great trying. I hope the next one is as good. The new quest has been great so far, I think you guys may enjoy it too. I am having a really good time today winning big and winning often that's a rare thing on any game anymore so for today this is the best"", ""While playing tiger tropics in the golden room I had the frozen row of tigers in the mini respond game and a wild on the 4th row and on the last respin two full rows of tigers stopped on rows 2 and 3 when the spin was done but then those two rows changed and slid down giving me two losing rows, that's cheating and it severely disappoints me because I normally enjoy this slot app. But now i think I'll spend what coins I have and take my play elsewhere."", ""I enjoy the game, and I've played a lot. the problem I have is how much they try to get your money, I have never left the game with more coins than I started with, and when I run out I just leave the game because it asks for money for more coins. Please make it easier to play for free, that's all I ask."", ""I am very disappointed in how the games are rolled during the spins. I am also very disappointed on the changes of the amount of the bet while playing. Just because I don't buy doesn't mean that the bet should change. I'll rest for awhile. I'll go in and pick up the money whenever it's available."", ""I play Caesars Slots all the time. It has become one of my very favorite games that I play.

Please fix that."", 'Too slow for free Be ready to play if you want to advance any amount in this game, the freebies will not be enough to get tasks accomplished, you have to bet beyond what you can win, not a bargain even by Vegas standards.

And when there is a special going don't expect to get anything out of it, like the Quest for the Chest. You can spend billions of coins and get nothing. And you are limited on the amount of gifts and free spins and if you don't collect them in time they take them from you. Lower levels are only allowed 2 free spins a day from friends. Higher levels around 500 are only allowed 6 free spins.""]"

Edit after response from Playtika UK: I have noticed an uptick in higher bonuses, which is helpful. I still find that the challenges are only winnable with purchases due to high qualifying bets. The higher dollar amount bonuses are nice though.', ""It's a very fun way to spend down time. The graphics are outstanding. Love the contest and payouts. Reasonable rates on purchases.Still having fun, you should give it a try. It has so many different games you should be able to find something you love too. Great start today 65 free games for 195,000 coins can't beat that. If they had 20 stars that's what I would give them. Frog game, love it. So not to long ago on one of the games I started winning big ended with 47 million. So I'm telling you I."", ""It's a good time passer. RNG in games is great. Free coins low, but spins and random gifts are superb. Free 100 spins, 20 a day? Doesn't work properly, 60 spins in 5 days so far. BUY COINS everywhere. Four buttons for it in main menu only. Every time you go to the menu, pop-up asks for money. No two step verification for purchase, straight away it prompts your CC. Misstapped? How sad. They fixed some issues in my first review, so kudos and higher rating from me."", ""Impossible to win and/or retain points. Side games like the 'Trip' are as exciting as watching paint dry....you would think you were going to win billions of points...but it's so little that it's not even worth playing!! BORING!!! Feb 2020..It's gotten worse!! Nothing but pop ups and coupons and gimmicks to get you to buy!! Inbox shows 9 items to collect when really there were 2 minimal amounts of coin to collect...the rest are Buy, Buy, Buy!! Time to uninstall !!"", ""So far so good. Just got app yesterday and got no bonuses, scatters, nothing. So played for about 20 mins and was broke. Today...different story. Lots of wins and will have some fun. I'm not asking for everything free. I get how you make money. Just I went broke so fast didn't have time to figure out if I liked it."", ""I'm not a huge 'slots' fan but I don't mind playing a few spins here & there on 'HOF'. Pros: • Variety of slots to play. • Variety of 'mini' reward games. • Unlike some other slots, there's NO creeps trying to add you as a friend! • Reward links via FB & email. Cons: • Takes FOREVER to get balance built back up once it gets low.... it's annoying as I will NOT spend real money on any slot game! • Some in-game mini games require minimum bet to participate. Pointless playing them otherwise!"", ""when i first started playing this app i would have given it 5☆after several updates for the app now when i load it, it some times takes ages for the game to load, when playing a game it will suddenly stop then takes ages to load again or you have to close the app. winning minor, major or grand prizes in any game i've noticed they've become less and less and few and far between. i also think it should be the player who decides how much to bet per game and not you raising the minium bet to play."", ""Awesome, fun for the whole family. Great entertainment. Great games!!!!!Playing everyday. Great!!! Can't put the phonedown. Wonderful!!! what an experience $$$ Marvelous, having a great time. The games are always changing for the best. I am enjoying it at all times of the day. Games continue to entertain and amuse. Definitely 6 stars.keeps getting better & better"", ""Too many pop ups. Mobile is better than web version but not by much. There's even a pop up telling me the previous challenge has ended, and that lasted an entire week. Good variety of games but most very tight. Very hard to find one you can play on without losing quickly. Lots of fun challenges but most too long and too difficult, and most come with multiple pop ups every time you load site. Too frustrating to enjoy."", 'Its ok. There ""Big win"" is usually only equal to 10 spins. And then they want you to update your review. And it constantly pops up saying you should increase your bit. And if you want any of the other stuff going on like cards or trophies . . . . Well the amount to play is WAY to much. They pretty much have it set-up so you get 5 mins of free play. Anything more than that cost. Sorry but I\'m not going to pay for fake money. We have real casinos for that. Same still', ""HOF games are fun but I'm not enjoying it much as I did when I first began playing HOF. I play the Daily Rush game, the challenge, it is in 3 stages. The first one is fine but HOF doesn't tell us how to play the 2nd one which I never completed. I've tried writing support twice but never heard back from them. House of Fun, please be kind to those who play the game."", ""Listen I would be lying to say I am not going to play on HOF, but I don't like the fact that once you get so far in the challenges they have the present box and completed stages come up and you can't finish the whole challenge there is always one stage or card or store you get far really far and spend the rest of your time trying to get that one thing. Come on guys make it fair ."", ""I like it we'll. The games are interesting. Plus, I like that I'm able to make extra coins by watching videos. The extra activity on the side like the genie one. Gives me the desire to keep spinning. So you go guys. Still Loving it. You deserve my rate yet again. Keep up the good work. One thing tho. I made a mistake saving the coins in the bank. Cannot see anything without my👓. I really don't want to spend money to get it out. Bummer out.😞"", 'Out of all the slot games ive played, this one is definitely one of the worst. I playes every single slot that was availible to me, and from that I can say the payouts in this game are ridiculously low. I hit the whole board, and only got enough to spin like 6 more time? Really? ""Big Win"" literally means nothing in this game, you dont get enough to do anything, and thanks to that even if you\'re on a winning streak you\'re still losing way more chips than you\'re making.', ""great! lots of fun!!! MY favorite game! Love the graffics ! I play all day till I run out of coins! I know it is a game of chance but the coins aren't enough to keep playing. I'm upset that some games I worked to unlock are locked now why? I don't think that is fair.I'm still gonna play till I'm broke!"", 'I am writing another review with an update. It seems like no matter how much money you spend you cannot get ahead in this game and it is a waste of money.there are times that you can go on major win streaks but they are very far and few between and since I am in such a high my qualifying bets are so high for the in-game challenges that it makes it impossible to keep any amount of. I am on level 1680 and the qualifying bet for every in-game challenge is well over a million coins.', ""Fun! Fun! Fun! A lot of different games to choose from. Some of the games have goofy names or silly music but they bring the fun. Oh! Loyalty is rewarded. HofF is my new favorite game. Thanks, HofF! Good job on the updates, and terrific problem solving. I can't recall the last time I had customer service send a message telling me what happened. Wow! That's about all I can say... Wow! I'm a fan!"", ""best games! play every day! love HOF but wish the collections were more as the betting amounts are too high for the money you get every three hours. I only get a few spins and then have a long wait for more. we can't all afford to buy! Still enjoy playing and free coins have been increased somewhat! Four stars now! would like to give five stars but everytime I win big its taken straight back.cant always be just bad luck!"", ""I've been playing for over 3 months usually daily. Great games, I got started with a free 1,000 and I have not had to buy anything. I just keep collecting the free points and I win enough to keep playing. I bet low maybe that's why I never have to buy anything and I haven't had any issues collecting anything. The only downside is that they lock up the games I like and I can't figure out if you have to pay to play them again or not but I can usually find another one I like."", ""I've been playing this game now for longer than I can remember and it's still as enjoyable all these many, many, many months later as it was when I first downloaded it and started playing. There's always something cool and rewarding everyday they're posting (i.e. coins and prizes) to collect daily. Love this game a lot more than some of the others I've played 😎😆😉"", ""Win % is horrible One would think to keep one interested bonus games with be easier to hit. 2/18/20 Update: i wouldn't spend 1 cents on app. The gummy slot, i must of spun over a thousand times already and not 1 time got the bonus wheel, not once. And almost every spin 2 wheels come up, never the third. And the reply from my first review is ridiculous. Like id post a review off 1 or 2 games. In fact i dont give reviews unless extremely good or horribly bad."", ""Downloaded as part of an offer wall. It's part casino and part mini games. Instead of just virtual currency, you also win assorted prizes toward mini games, that then pay out in game currency. By restricting your winnings they hope you'll spend actual money. You can earn free coins daily but it will take forever to earn the reward the offerwall made in the first place. If you just want a casino game, there are better ones out there. As a random distraction, this is fun enough."", ""Just started to kill some time lost all my chips super fast with in minutes so game didn't kill much of my free time I had. Maybe I was really unlucky or it's set up for you to lose fast either way you start with next to nothing for chips to try out the site. Unless your willing to spend cash on a site before you even know if you like it. I'm for one not willing to. Lucky there are lots of different sites these days so I will try a different one and hope it's better."", ""Very challenging slots very entertaining each slot is an Adventure. Never a dual moment with HOF. I find myself so entertained at times that I don't even realize that hours have gone by. For many hours of great fun House of Fun is the way to go! Fantastic fun. But once you start prepared to be addicted to the fun.!!!!!!!"", 'the game itself is enjoyable and rewarding if you remember it is a game and sometimes in games you lose.

Thanks team, you made a difficult situation easier to handle. nothing to change. still having fun', ""2.6.20 Update As a Promo Game offers Free spins (10) but only at 150. I win a whole 259.

This game requires you log in every 3 hours if you wanna get free coins', ""I have a loyal NFL player for years and I'm Highly dissatisfied with the play of HOF anymore!!!!! The last few months I have play I have had no play and have spent not millions but Billions of coins and nothing to show for it . Not even any enjoyment out of playing. The challenges suck, unless you spend thousands of dollars you can't win at any of them. HOF you should be ashamed!!!"", ""use to love this game but now it's all about spending money and you don't really win anything anymore. I've spent more money than I'd like to admit and I've gotten nothing for it!!! I wrote the first half about 2 months ago and it's starting to get a little better with more winning and payouts. Thank you and I hope you continue to make it better!! So I continued playing and the more I maximized my bet the more I won and I ended up winning a Grand Jackpot. Thank You So Much HOF"", ""This is probably one of the worst slot machine games first of all you hardly ever win the free spins that they give you hardly payout anyting.

I wish the free froggie games were like they used to be. The only draw back with house of fun is the free coin amounts. Most slot games once you reach my level of over 770 you are getting millions but here my amount is 3,500. My free gifts from friends is even lower.

I was only trying to make them aware of the issue and he was acting like I was trying to scam him out coins or something. He was pretty rude.', ""Been playing this game for one week. I can say that it's different from any other slots game that I played. It's my first time in almost 6 years of playing slot games (and I play alot and spend lots of money on slot games) that I ever won a jackpot. This game doesn't force you to pay to play and the fun part is the bonuses that the game gives to players apart from the slot machines."", 'This game is geared towards wasting your money more than most in the slots genre.

Lol., Makes it hard to buy anything for myself."", 'So a good slot machine and what you would expect to play at a casino has a payout percentage of a round 90% and if it is as little as 85% it is a terrible slot and should never be played. After spending a lot of time on the house of fun app and website I can find no written list of payout amounts on the slots they have but based my math the best payout of any of the games unlocked up to level 50 is around 65%. That is basically robbery. Most games pay back your bet or more only 10-15% of spins.', ""Great game! I wasn't sure about it for a few days, then i discovered all the extra ways to get coins beside watching videos. I racked up enough to start betting heavier and started actually winning enough to matter. The new slot challenge and the board game are both fun. The only thing I would change is once you have met a trunk challenge it would no longer show up. They should fall out somehow but no you open an iron trunk, get 2 figures and 1 is already finished. Not cool at all.""]"

Most of times many tables are vaccant and u got to shift on lower tables.', 'I do not buy chips, I only play what is given through game. It is or seems very hard to win a hand.

You should add a ""report"" button so players can report or block such players access.', ""Usually a very good group @ the table, unless & until you have a jackass that doesn't know how to play so they go all in every hand (BINGO)! Either that or they are there just to cause trouble, being vulgar or just they downright rude."", ""I used to love this game, but now all I see is rude people, they get mad if you take to long. You can choose a faster paced table if you dont like it. Next is all the same profile characters. All G's with a plain name. . something doesn't seem right with that. Last is the weird winnings. I have had a better hand that I know for sure should have one, and someone will win with a bs hand. It doesn't make sense... please fix. Would love to keep playing.""]"

For instance it would be better if you could join your own and also kick people. The club I was placed in has 18 inactive players which makes it tough to reach milestones. Another thing that could improve gameplay is the 20k CP/player cap. With inactive and low scoring members, it would be nice if my club points could add up past 20,000.

First, there is now a full time ad at the top of the screen even though I bought the ad-free app. This also has the unpleasant result of making the cards much smaller. Secondly, it now takes more than ten times the number of bets to move to the next level. Is this my reward for giving a good review? I guess I'm back to looking for a decent video poker app. Original review: I have downloaded and uninstalled at least 25 video poker games. This is the only one I still have and I play it every day. The graphics are so clear and the color so vibrant! My only complaint is not being able to choose the amount of my bet. I really dislike that I can only opt to double my bet.

It's rigged. Whenever I have a good hand and want to raise, the controls freeze until I automatically fold. It's game breaking. And after years it's still not fixed! This is probably the last chance I've given this game. It has potential but this kind of bug for years (and 3 different phones) is unacceptable. Very very frustrating!"", ""It's fun but you need to be aware there are a lot of bots that are programmed in to win. Lots of bingo players too. It's okay with the free chips they give but if you buy them, they'll get them back with the bots. I guess that's how they make money though since the game is free. I've been playing on my original free chips for a while so it's not horrible. Just not great either."", ""I like this game a lot but have one question and would be great if answered. Me and a friend who play this game are also friends on this game. We like to play with each other, so we've tried private room but we dont like taking each other's money. So we go to monte carlo to find each other, but have never found each other in the year or two we've had this. Are you not supposed to find friends when going to a room, only private rooms work. Or are we just very unlucky."", ""Love the game but everytime I win someone reports my profile as improper and my picture gets blocked, its ridiculous, I have to email them everyday to unblock my profile. I shouldn't have to do that when I spend my money on it. Its too easy to block a profile so until its is sorted I won't be spending anymore money on this app"", ""Excellent quality from beginning until your a millionaire....the bull fighting as well as the lucky table is a treat that you won't find on another site......the old western day's theme is a unique touch that I haven't seen before, it takes a minute to get use to but once you do it is a comfortable environment to play some quality hold'em and make some serious coin slow and easy....5 stars!!!!"", ""It's alright, have to be really careful. Games a tricky one. It can tick you off . Of course you have people who don't know what their doing, cause you to miss up. Have to have patience and stay calm and focus. Never take a min not watching the game. Bullfight very tricky. Take time watch cards carefully. Always watch out for last 2 cards."", ""Awesome game. I've played for hours and haven't had to watch more than one ad to keep playing. A lot of cool game variations and ways to earn more chips to keep playing even if you lose them all. I've been given 25k about 10 different times after going down to zero. Great app."", '(Company keeps erasing my review).. The game is full of computer bots that will take your chips. They are impossible to beat. They\'re in every room. It\'s a fun game, but the ""explosion of bots"" have ruined the fun in it.', 'This app is BS. You will never see so many people hit BS rivers. If you don\'t spend money on chips you can lose a billion chips in a week playing 10 mil SNGs. If one of the people playing reports your ""profile"" as inapropriate, there is no profile other than a photo, they will remove your photo and your ability to post another. People routinely play hands such as 72, 64, 92 etc, and will beat pocket pairs often in defiance of poker statistics. Don\'t expect much from this app.', ""Unless they can prove it I really believe this game is rigged every room I'm in there's a hacker if there are two they never compete against each other. Does People only buy chips to get other players to cheat and steal their chips? come on give me a break this is a rip-off.. you asked about my pinion you got it. If it's not true then do something about hackers!!!. is this the way y'all keep people buying the chips? And I noticed every hacker has changed the way they play."", 'Too many players pull out some kind of way and take your winnings.....when you won the hand.

Another person had a straight which ment that person won as well as the person with a pair. It's happened more than once. I used to enjoy playing poker but I won't play it again.
