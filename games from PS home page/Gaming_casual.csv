Let’s play!","[""Best game ever! This games is so addicting, it puts you in a situation where you can't get tired of swiping... Every level and episode is challenging in it's own way and there are many features and rewards that are really exciting in the Candy Kingdom. I've been playing it since a long time ago and i've gotten three diamond trophies and still on the hunt for more achievements... If there are more than five stars, i would happily rate it because this game deserves it.!"", ""Addictive, fun and soothing. BUT...sometimes (lots of the time) I wonder if the game was designed to make you use your boosters or purchase them. I've observed that (more often than not) when I fail a level, it's usually by 1-3 moves. It's apparent (to me) it's by design and not coincidence."", ""I always come back to this game. it is peaceful and fun. There is something about all the Candy Crush games they give you so much entertainment and you're fun to do! Current updates make the game newer each time you play and give you more opportunities. The Candy Crush family is so exciting to be a part of. It's never the same old game. Stay updated change it give you new new chances to win more. Keep it up CCF, You're one of the best games there is!"", ""You guys changed something about this game making it quite harder. Before, when am using boosters, as long as i haven't swiped or made a move, i could easily go back, then come back again till my boosters align the way i want to make it easier and fun to work with. But now, i can't do that cause each time i want to go back even tho i haven't made a move, you make me loose a life and make the whole booster a waste cause it hasn't been used and it's quite harder since. I play a level for weeks!!!"", ""On level 6,347. Getting to REALLY dislike this game...so many changes, like only 5 candy drops now per game. And now when you lose a game, you lose...no option to buy gold bars or use the ones in your bank to continue the game and lives get used faster. I've always enjoyed the challenge, and it used to be fun, but now it's becoming a money pit and I won't let myself go there. Shame on you, King."", ""This game is really fun. I like how they have started to add more challenges lately. However I'm disappointed about the glitch with sending and receiving lives. I'm getting over 50 request for lives a day, when they are supposed to be sent as free lives to play. Usually the creators are quick to fix any bug issues, but I will say I'm a little upset that it's been over 2 weeks and it seems like more glitches are just adding on to the game.... what's happening??"", ""Probably my favorite game but one thing... I'm at a significantly higher level than a lot of my friends who play. I'm unable to easily send them lives. I have to scroll back hundreds of levels to access most of them. There should be a friends section that shows active players, stats, and send gift buttons. This is really the only complaint I have after 6+ years of playing. Obviously I love the game though."", ""It's not glitchy so thats good. Wish it wouldn't give me suggestions after 2 seconds. I like to figure it out on my own. I'm not in a rush. Maybe like 7 seconds later would be better. Amd I have gold bars. But I cant seem to use them. When I'm playing it said I filled it to 60 twice. When I try to use them to buy candy it wants me to pay for it. Even though I earned them."", 'Repetative game with lottery function. Kill your time if you wish, but this game is more of luck than skills. Eg. Some of the tracks are based on pure luck. You just cannot pass them without spending extra items, turns... so spending money eventually (that is where I put my line). Not worth of my time anymore', 'Really very bad experience while playing some levels. Further, my fantastic 5 team is useless. No team work. None logs in and win. I wish you that you provide additional boosters free while playing some very hard levels. Hope you understand, its not all about making money, its about the fun and craziness you should look after from the people for your game. Please reduce the prices of gold bars. And please put me in some other team who wants to play and enjoy the Candy Crush Saga. Hope u got it.', ""Fun game. However, the creators have become greedy. I remember the days basic candy costs 79p AND you had a unlimited life for a set amount of time. Now, it's a minimum of 2.99 for basics and no unlimited hearts and even then, if you lose all your lives, by the time the counter gives you another life, your bonus has ran out meaning you have to BUY MORE. Asking my bank for a full refund as I think it's pretty unfair. This game used to be good now its greed!!!"", 'Love the game a lot! However, the public contest is not fair to those who are very far in the game since the levels are harder for us, unlike those who are not yet far in the game or probably just starting the game. We should not be paired with them at all since their level are much easier. They are likely to win every contest. I feel it should be like the episode race since we are playing the same levels. Kindly attend to it!', ""I'm not getting any boosters when the games is done. The spins but no candy n a lot of boards are hard help me out give me something to stay active what's up with the candy booster.when the candy jar is supposed to be at the left top corner of the board. And the booster spins but I don't get nothing. In fact I been playing y'all spam games in these games are boring anyways. So I'll be deleting tomorrow all of them"", ""Better not ever crash because regardless of whether your connected with Facebook or not they will take everything from gold bars to every buff and you won't even get a sorry! Do not recommend this game! Progress is saved from Facebook but only the level your on nothing else?? Go figure?? But they say their working on it. Been working on it for years! Lies! ???"", 'Fun to play? Let me say, I would not advise a compulsive gambler to play this game. The game is rigged, meaning it is designed to make you spend as much money as possible to purchase items for the game. When a game has to rearrange the pieces because of no more possible moves, then the game is designed to create roadblocks forcing you to use the tools you must buy to advice in the game. It gets one star, because of how deceptive the creator is tricking you to spend money at every level.', ""Great game, only downfall is I have a colour defect (some colours look the same as others) so when I get the levels with the bombs I have to ask someone to do it for me as I can't work out which colours they are plus when you get to the higher levels I noticed you don't get through as many levels as you did at the start sometimes you don't get through any in the five life's, also would be great if after so many levels you do you could get an extra life added on"", ""This game is fun - when you actually play it. In between each level there are 8 separate pop ups that are frustrating, annoying and make the whole game not worth it. After you complete 1 level you have to click out of pop ups about you finishing the level, receiving points, seeing leader boards that no one could care about, feeding some dragon, introduced to a new sub plot, click to the new level, and finally you can play! It's a pain in the ass to say the least."", 'I was enjoying candy crush over the years and this is the first time I am giving it a ratings, and after I will uninstall the app. Reason for doing so is that the app was good that am addicted to the game, now every day they make some rubbish changes that makes the game less interesting. Why do King have to cut down amount of reward to five, it should be unlimited. Now the game get so boring. When I ran out of lives, I can play a game that I already pass to get rewards. Now it is limited .', 'Pretty addicting and fun game to play on my commute to and from work. Only critique so far is wish the game would explain how the new types of lock tiles work as you play for the 1st time they appear. For me I turned off hints so it would stop showing me which pieces to swap cause it made game too easy imo but I still want to know the new concepts in the game. Should add toggle for tutorial on/off and keep hints on/off option as a seperate option.', 'Its entertaining. I am doing this for the free candy. I do find myself getting into it when I have down time. I can see how it can get addictive. Do i really have to Wright 500 characters to get this. It seems a bit excessive. But I guess I will keep typing till it reaches the 500. I woke up this morning and made my morning coffee as I always do. Then I sit to relax and enjoy my morning before work. The as nature calls. I grab my phone and take my morning seat. I start to play and find myself', 'I have just been introduced to this game by my daughter, it is very addictive. Review update, OMG I am getting dark circles and bags under my eyes, I get into bed and think well I will just have one game ha ha no chance one hour later I am still battling the candies. The downside is that if I run out of target support I have to purchase them, I have purchased once but feel this is not a road that I can go down when income is restricted.', ""I'm using Samsung A9 (2018), I found the response when slide the most right hand side, up and down or left to right (for the most right 2 candy), the movement is not responsive even it can sense my highlight, but cant move. this happen almost when I just change to use this new mobile, I assume it is not my mobile problem since I didn't got same problem when usong other apps"", ""I thought I would never find a game so awesome and so epic as this one. It is a real brain teaser because you got to figure out how to do many different tasks at the same time with being limited how much you move. Many years ago, I used to watch my wife play and now that I got the game now, I'm very addicted to this."", ""This game can give you a headache and blury vision. I had that experience on stage 1136. I don't know what happen. I think it is because loop music and the graphic. On that stage it is very wierd candies position. When you blast some candies its move around and make my head feel like spinning watching its movement."", ""Candy crush is my obsession since forever! I've passed 5000 levels till today! But i have been disappointed lately with the changes you have made! Why did you change that with exiting a level without using a single move takes away one life?!?! Sometimes you push the wrong level by mistake, that woukd cost you a life! Also the daily wheeel almost akways stops at the fish... I have won the fortune box only once! Which makes me sure that its impossible thats its just luck!"", 'Loving these games. Graphics are clean and bright with beautiful colours, the only problem, soo addictive. My partner is a couple hundred levels over me but has been playing for years,. He showed me these games. Just remember to how to get the most out of the least moves,. Sometimes very frustrating but once u pass a hard one that took ages u will be very satisfied with your self.', 'No words for it.it is very great.i like this game. I can spend my leisure time by playing it. Some time level goes hard but by never giving up will help to upgrade level. We can easily paly this game. We can gaet different types of playing elements which helps to increase our level easily. It gives us entertainment while playing. While palying we can get different types of gift whch make us more easier to play the game.we can share our lives with friends.we can also ask friends life. It is nice.', ""So far this game is not only fun but winnable. Makes all the difference to me. As someone on a fixed budget it's nice to not have to spend real money on it . Only thing I truly don't like about it is the pig, you earn the gold bars by playing the game but then you have to pay to open the pig. The ads we watch should be paying for the piggy bank. 😔"", ""I love the game when it works but when there's issues and there's nothing on the multiple choice list pertaining to your issue. Your stuck. My game won't connect to my Facebook. I've logged out of Facebook and back in. I use to be connected to Facebook through my game, but all of a sudden for whatever reason my game was no longer connected to my Facebook and won't reconnect. If I'm not reconnected then I guess I will have to uninstall"", 'The game itself is addictive but perhaps too much focus on silly storylines and just a number of clicks between games (not ads, just results menus and transitions). But all in all, good game. Never thought it would be quite as much fun', 'Not as much fun as it used to be; even more glaringly obvious that ""the fix is in"" and you won\'t pass a level until the game decides you will, and at this point, I don\'t really care tbh. The many recent changes designed to limit the number of boosters collected doesn\'t help things, either.', 'The experience is not good I can hear lot of poping ice blocks. Not one of my ice blocks were broken I had 3 trys and 3 striped candy when the game ended I still had 11 ice blocks to break. How is that possible. It seems that the progress a person is very very slow and a long process spending lots of money and getting nowhere this game use to be fun but now its costly and stressfull', 'Primarily, a game of getting a lucky board, in app purchases or watching long ads. Recent updates and changes have taken much of the skill required to complete a level out of the game. If you have a lot of money to spend on boosters then you will enjoy the experience.', ""It's decent. I recently started playing again. All was fine until I couldn't accept my prize. It says to connect to claim my prize. But connect what? I have updated the app, log out and in multiple time but nothing seems to be working. So.. Yeah.. 1 star."", 'Played for years, but will probably uninstall soon. High levels are pretty much designed to need boosters to complete, and the constant hints and promopts to buy have become more than annoying, plus recent changes to lose lives just by backing out of a board without making a move, etc have made the game much less enjoyable. It has become slick and gimmicky lately, and bore some.', ""I always come back to this game and it's very cool...I noticed that when I ask friends for extra lives and someone sent it to me when I try to accept it, it will cancel the extra life but will not appear for me to play. I just received 4 extra lives but unable to use them. Kindly work on this. Thanks"", 'this is Fun and challenging and a great way to stay sharp! Well I should be sleeping but want to be first. I am close! A great way to avoid the television. 2nd review. I Am a senior and this game keeps my mind active. 3rd review. As usual I am enjoying my candy crush! Can not sleep so I am playing Candy Crush. Great game.....wonderful game. No one home good time to play.', ""Love it great game. Lots of fun. Very challenging.Great game addicting.Can not stop playing. Just gets more fun every day. More fun every day. Just can't stay 3. Just keep playing and playing. So much fun. Just keep playing and playing. Awesome game. I wish I could stop playing but that is impossible."", ""I don't consider impossible levels a challenge. If anything mildly boring or frustrating. This game is rigged to let you pass at it's own tempo. That's not a challenge. At best this game is a idle time waster and at worse a slightly cynical pyramid scheme. Although the fake profiles that give 6 stars seem impressed! 🤣🤣"", ""Game is what it is. What really irks me is all the pop ups in between the levels. I don't care what other players are on, who is beating me in the weekly race or and whatever else is the pop ups. Also what's with the show works at the end of the levels. I just want to play! On my own.""]"

Shame on you for that. Didn't miss a thing on almost everyone of them but you are screwing people over by doing this. I would give it a 5 star rating otherwise but since you're being underhanded... It doesn't even deserve a one star. I have since uninstalled because you are screwing people over and I don't like underhanded people. God's going to get you for that!!!"", 'Like the game. It can be very addictive at times. I have won all 475 levels and there are no levels left. It just says, ""Coming soon."" I\'m not rushing y\'all lol, but hurry up and add more levels. Thanks.', ""I already wrote a review, but after reading some of the others, I feel the need to comment. I am at level 445, and it hasn't cost me a penny. Time, yes, but no cash. It is doable. And for those who complain about the difficulty and bubble colours that aren't useable, that's part of the challenge. Use your head. If it was too easy, it wouldn't be any fun."", 'Stupid. Some of the obstacles that you have to overcome to finish the levels are ridiculous and have no set rules. For example, the bubbles with the locks on them... sometimes it takes only one time to bust them and sometimes it takes five times. Make up your freaking minds already! Also, what the heck are the bats about? Seriously? Is someone obsessed with Halloween or something?', ""It's a game like candy crush, I spent a few hours playing it and wish I hadn't. Very annoying. Computer randomly allocates ball colour, so difficult levels may be impossible without paying with money to get 'bonuses'... You still pay by watching the annoying adverts. So many adverts. On the plus side, it doesn't ask for any permissions to play and it seems well programmed."", 'Very light but addictive... great way to relax and clear my mind for a while. Love this game! My only gripe is that your game progress is saved to the device only, so ... if you get a new phone or reinstall the app for any reason you start over.', ""Great game. When are the new levels being added though, as I have been maxed out for a few months now? Really want new levels asap as I was kinda addicted to this game, but feel if no new levels are launched very soon, I'll have to move onto other similar apps instead. I'll give it 5 stars again when new levels are added. FYI for newcomers to the game, it is 5 stars worthy. I'm just a bit salty nothing new has been added in a few months and I'm maxed out lol. Edit: 5 stars"", ""It's a really fun game with elements for a few similar games that I've been playing for 25 years. It is really easy in the beginning, save the power ups, boosts, and lives for the levels after 50, they are significantly harder so you earn less lol. I highly recommend this game for fans of Bubble Mania and Bustamove."", 'This game was good until i started losing lives do to a bug. The bug includes the ball or bubble clipping out of bounds and making the round un completable. The fact is this game should not offer paid services... Its also possible this wasnt fixed to instill the need to buy more lives. 89 levels in and never coming back. Un installed going to bubble witch. Best cash grab 2019. Enjoy your one star game.', 'The first few levels do what they say: remove ball and get reward. But the higher the level the less stars. Rule: remove balls get high score and stars. Your game does not follow through. I remove all the balls before shooters run out and get only 1 star. If there is more you need to do to get 3 stars where are the instruction? Up to level 16 you give out stars 17 and above you do not allow 3 stars.', ""I almost uninstalled this game after the first level because it's ridiculously easy. BUT, if you change your goal to getting THREE STARS on EVERY SINGLE LEVEL, it's a nice challenge. Then you have to think about your streak and and your multipliers and it becomes more of a strategy game, which is nice."", 'good game, but sometimes the ball goes past the ""ceiling line"" and controls get stuck... (can\'t aim or shoot bubbles) so the only thing to do is restart the level... sucks when you were getting 3 stars, then you gotta start over again...', 'Why put a jackpot wedge on the wheel if you never intend for your players to land on it? Now, a month ago I completed level 460 and that is as far as it goes. I have coins left, requested a refund, no reply from them and no refund!!!!', '100% of the time, they change the direction of the balls in mid air, and if you reload the game, so that actually aim where you aimed, and not change the direction of the ball in mid air, they charge you money!!!!!! This ""game"" is a SCAM, and a ROBBERY!!!!!!', ""I wish I could give this negative stars. You can only go so far without paying to win. After a certain point the levels become unwinnable unless you have the boosters. Guess how you get boosters? That's right, you gotta buy coins. I'll be uninstalling this from my phone"", ""Easy to learn, takes a bit to master. Ads are unobtrusive. It's a good way to pass time while you are waiting at appointments or on public transportation, since you can stop playing at any point in the game and not mess it up."", ""Has a glitch in some levels when you're near the end of the level the ball shoots through the ceiling and you can't shoot again without restarting the level. Would be nice to have more levels to play beyond 460"", 'This game is difficult enough to make you concentrate but not enough to make you discouraged. This makes it fun to keep coming back when there is a free minute. High praise and a thank you for giving us this game at no cost?', ""Seemingly the accuracy of the bulls changes to work against you once you have won at various levels. Limit ability to earn add on boosters or coins even as you advance levels. Certain levels basically take your life. The ball colors don't align to give the player a real chance to clear ball's."", 'Good for passing time. Seems so easy at first but gets harder in the higher levels. Save your special powerups until you absolutely need them.', ""Really like how it's not a pay to win game and that there a lot of free unlockable bonus items. To get rid of ads just pay 99 cents and boom gone. No having to pay extra to turn ads off for a period of time or any of that nonsense."", ""I am in my 40's and found I reallyblike this game, especially once you get higher on the levels, because you have to be precise on how you shoot the balls. Only change I would make is I could do without all the princess theme of it lol"", ""I really like the game but I can't stand the ads. Remember the days when you paid for the app and used it forever? This new thing where you have to continually pay has got to go. Now I am only getting apps that I pay once and no ads!!!!"", 'Color of given balls are useful in the lower levels but become more useless higher up. Then you have to either buy more balls or watch ads. It also has a loot box like system so this game will be illegal in Europe.', ""If you like Bubble games, this is a good one. There aren't many breaks for ads while playing the game. The game itself starts out easy and gets quite difficult."", 'I remember why I uninstalled this game before. Regularly gives bubble colors that do not pop any bubbles to advance the game. Frustrating and just not fun.', ""Most frustrating game because you literally can't advance levels without having to pay for extra things. Trust me, I know. I got sucked in and spent way too much. Never again, I'm uninstalling now. Save your money and don't bother."", ""Pay to win. Once you get to level 100 unless you're willing to spend money it becomes almost impossible. Poor level design and zero incentive to buy coins or add ons due to the gane being absolute garbage. I wish I could give it minus stars."", ""Best past time ever relaxing fun the game will get harder as I go along but I'm all in don't mind a challenge not rich can't spend money on Perks but I will continue playing this game graphics beautiful this game is so much fun for now thank you so much I'm having a blast when it gets harder might cry try not too give up my second best game by far next too spades love it🤗"", ""Game only has 430 levels, they keep saying more levels 'coming soon'...but nothing ever happens! I don't think anyone ever maintains this site...too bad, I really like this game..about ready to uninstall if more levels are not added...😞😞😞😞😞"", 'Scoring rules are a mystery. Multiple plays of the same game, with the same ""clear all the bubbles"" accomplished - yields quite different point totals each time, with no explanation or direction on how points are determined.', ""Fun while it lasted. Apparently the designers only went up to Level 460 and then walked away... I'll go ahead and download something by King. At least it will have more than 460 levels"", 'Every game is a new challenge.

Ads pop up in the middle of the round, when you return to the game it shoots the bubble to whatever dude of the screen the x was on the ad was to close the stupid unwanted ad was. It also double shoots bubbles sometimes especially if you have a previous tough shot."", ""I love this game but lately it been freezing and everything and there are to many ads and the ads don't even be 30 seconds long and they make my phone freeze and every level get harder every time I play I'm on level 268 and it won't let me get my extra 3 bubble and it cheat me every time I try get them it make look at the ads and then it won't let me get my bubbles and I don't that's fair and I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one complain about the 3 extra bubbles.......And the ads be so boring."", ""It seems like in order for the creators to make the levels harder as you play they just stop giving you the color of balls that you need.

http://help.pou.me","[""I played this game many years ago, back when I was like 8. Im now 15, and I randomly thought of this game. Turns out, they still had my Pou from back then linked to my email!! It was so refreshing to go back in time really. It's indescribable really. It was such a simpler, easier time. This app means alot for some reason. Thank you for being a part of my childhood."", ""The only issues I have is that the game can crash when increasing the friends list. Also when you save your game and re-log in on a different device, it can take you back to where you were a month or two ago; meaning that your level will drop and you won't own those items you once had. But apart from that, the game is decent. Even-though it hasn't had any noticible updates since 2013 -15."", ""This game is nice but one thing bugs me. There are so many interesting outfits and options but they're locked from level 20-80. At least some of the things should have been freely available at first hand so that the user can try on and experience something new for their pou that will make them crave to earn more as the levels progress. Seeing them already too far ahead makes me not want to try for more."", 'Pou is a classic! Pou has been one of my favorite mobile games since I was little. Pou can get a bit boring but it is fun! You take care of Pou, he is a little brown alien-like creature that needs care, food, sleep, medicine and more! You can play games, water your plants, take your pet on a walk, drive a car, ride on a skateboard and much more.', 'I wanted to log in, but when I\'m typing in my email, or clicking ""Account"" in settings, the game crashes. It doesn\'t happen only on my phone, but my friends has literally the same glitch. I can\'t get my old save. Overall the game is very good. Just fix this geme-breaking bug. Please.', ""I like the game but can you add some other clothing like pants and stuff like that, more rooms unlocked by age or coins, and how about a toothbrush? Oh and can you be more specific with the age groups (levels)? Here's what I was thinking of: Levels 1-3: Baby Levels 4-5: Toddler Levels 6-13: Child Levels 14-18: Adolescent Levels19-20: Young Adult Levels 21+: Adult These improvements will make the game more realistic."", 'I hate this! When I used the guestbooks alot of times it will alwayd crash my phone!!! I have fast Android 7.1 Nougat phone! I tried everything I delete cache and uninstalled and installeed again but nothing work! Also I see alot dirty people and they name their pous P*n*s, A**hole, etc. You should update fixing all this and please make this game a little more social', 'I do really like this game but, i wanted to buy a new pillow for my pou to sleep on. I went to buy it and i wasnt on a high enough level so i payed to unlock it, i didnt have enough money to actually buy it so i made the money i needed and i go to buy it and i have to unlock it AGAIN. This is really unfair because it takes time to make that kind of money on the game. Fix this please!!!', ""So there was this weird glitch that really annoyed me that the wheels on the car were small and my hamster was big and you couldn't see my pou or hamster in the car. Other then that I enjoy it, I don't get the same feeling as taking care of my bunny, but it's fine."", ""It is the best game ever,I love playing it when I'm bored but there is only one small little problem.it takes too long to get the pour to finish sleeping but overall I think it is a really good game😁"", ""Best virtual pet game:the reason I say this is because in poo it's just a really chill game that also incorporates real pet situations like there being poop and the pou needing to be fed that's why I truly think this is the best pet game p.s the mini game are fun aswell"", 'This is the pioneer of pet games. Its a fantastic pet game where you can customise your own pet and play games with him. There is an immense selection of food to buy and you can meet other Pous. Overall I think this is one of my favourite games ever. I recommend.', 'Our whole family loves Pou! He/she is adorable many fun games to choose from no annoying ads that interrupt the game. There is always a good fun challenge on the games that make you want to play until you beat your high score!!!!!', ""This game is awesome when I get bord I play it this game has every thing I play it all the time all so you all should buy from my mom's business it is called Faith by Design it has so many options for t-shirts and you can also get cups from her with designs that you pick you can pick naughty one good ones you can also get Banks little piggy bank things boxes with a design of your choice on them it is really really awesome so justgo on her website and it's just Faith By design"", 'Best game sience i was 6, the outfits are so many that i cant get bored, and many games to play and discover, i like the way you can customize pou and car, especially for the car cause i love cars. And i hope theres more updates about cars and the game so we cant get bored', 'This amazing nostalgic game has been with me for years and I still love it, especially when I found out that I could unblock higher level clothes with coins! Fun, friendly and great for meeting other kind people!', ""I like this app but it's been the same for years, never seems to have up dates, need some new stuff in the app, like need more food/different food in there, new wall paper designs, new games..."", 'Awesome app! I can already tell it is addictive. It is well thought out. We had two pous do the mimic feature at the same time, it was hilarious.', ""I have never had a pet before and this is the perfect way to get in to one if you never had one and if your allergic And you wonder what it's like to have a pet. Then this is the perfect game for you. And if you've never had a pet before And if you're not allergic. And you don't want to buy one. This game is virtual. It'll be perfect for you."", ""I like the game I've been playing it ever since I was seven it has been very very very very very a lot of fun for me I think the game Pou husband very very in extremely fun very extremely most fun with me but overall I sometimes agree with you guys but one thing that bugs me is how you have to use coins to get everything"", ""I'd say it's good not like it's the best game in the world and this came out like 2013? 2011? And now it's 2019 and I'm still downloading it and deleting it over and over I guess it's just one of those games you can't get tired of unless your a impasiant dork"", 'This is the most lovely game that ive seen coz you get to ride skateboard drive car play volley ball pou is a little pet alien that is brown you could change the skin though he is little at start but grows with stuff the game is so nice. Good luck 🍔', 'This game is okay but it does entertain kids that want your phone.

I thought it was more of a decision-based game where I would be challenged to make choices to get characters out of situations. That was the advertisement. Nonetheless, decorating items in a room is cool and the games to earn stars are challenging but I do feel doing a ""very hard"" game just to make a phone call gets frustrating and starts to become a waste of time.', ""I love that it doesn't cost a lot to repair the home. I wish you could win more points to open the storyline. I do enjoy the game. The longer you play the more points the game takes from you. You have to use your tokens for dumb things like. get the cat out the rocks. get only 2 chairs when the table has four. Other things like open a gift. To even answer the door. So that means more tokens use but you can barely win tokens for the storyline. That's why I quit playing these types of games."", ""This game is not simply a home renovation game as advertised. It requires stars for unrelated projects like making a phone call or meeting people at the door. Things you do not want to do. The beginning levels are fun but eventually you get to levels that are impossible to beat without spending real money. And even after you pay for extra moves and tools, it doesn't help. I've been playing and paying and still cannot beat some levels. Do not waste your money like I did."", 'I NEVER really do feedback like this...especially negative feedback...but this game is SOOO FRUSTRATING because you have to play one level for DAYS to win...most times with one piece left! You get No help..the blasters SUCK at removing blockades (if you get any) and even if you combine two of the most ""powerful"" ones...I wanted to read feedback to see if anyone else was having the same problem and its seems it\'s the game.. sooo uninstalling...shame because it started out really cool and fun👎', 'Like many others i too downloaded the game because of the advertisements. The game is no way what they say it is. The false advertising is deceitful and shameful. The levels are ridiculously hard to beat without purchasing coins. The fact that it takes 900 coins to continue is outrageous. The game is designed to block you at every turn. Earning one star per level to complete simple tasks that take at least 2 or 3 stars is crazy. Terrible game. I am uninstalling and will not recommend to anyone.', 'This game is a total money grab. Levels aren\'t even rated properly, ie some ""easy"" levels should actually be ""super hard"" so you\'d know to actually prep yourself with powerups if you have them. The coins you get for completing levels is way too low. You truly have to spend actual money to make any reasonable progress. I actually love a challenge but this game is designed for people to fail, get frustrated and buy in-game coins.', ""Doesn't matter what you offer, I get stuck on levels for weeks until the tournaments are over and then I beat it. It happens all the time. I can't believe that I wasted all my power ups and coins to beat a level with one move left and my paper airplane won't hit it this game is a joke I am not buying anything to waste my money on power ups that don't work."", 'Love the game, HOWEVER do not like how much coins it costs to get just 5 extra moves when the reward for winning is less than 100. In addition to that, the cost to purchase more boosters is so expensive. Why does it cost 900 coins for 5 moves when you only win about 50? Same goes for Gardenscapes. Very frustrating.', 'Great game overall the only downside is it takes too long to refill the hearts when hearts are empty also there can be too many ads in the game also you keep having super hard levels every few levels which sometimes can be a bit frustrating because the game can sometimes not let you win and then all of a sudden it will suddenly let you win makes no sense a bit of fixing going on with the game the game will let u win after so many times of trying fairer game play needed.', 'Game is rather slow and kinda of boring. Too many tasks, and not enough moves alot of the times. Gives you rainbow balls...and gives you no choice but to use it pointlessly. Will tell you you have 8 moves left and after 2 it tells you that you are out. And I just beat a level and it gave me 6 hours free...try 2...the other 4 just magically disappeared. I hope noone pays for this game it has alot of kinks to be worked out. I think the strategy is to try to force you to buy stuff....', 'This game is a load of fun if you spend money on it. Only time I am able to clear levels is after I spend money. If I go a day or two without purchasing something the game becomes impossible. Spend a little money the next 10 level become super easy without powerups and extras. Disappointed.', ""Once you get to level 54 it's over , this game is more frustrating than fun, not worth it anymore. It is extremely difficult to progress and you haven't even left the 1st floor rooms in the main house. It may be fun for extreme gamers but not people looking for a game to play daily by average people. This is a good game at the beginning to get you hooked but leaves you with absolutely no way to win once you start to progress just a little . You cannot progess out of the 1st main rooms."", ""I have been talking with customer support about giving the game PLAYER options with the ELEMENTS (decorations). I AM SURE I am not the only one that does not want the statues, wall mask, and tin armor in the living room. They gave us options with the furniture, they can give us options with the decorations. An easy fix would LET US SELL WHAT WE DONT WANT. The support person continue to say no. Unless alot of people complain they won't make the change."", ""After so many levels, they make them so hard it's basically impossible to win them without spending real money for coins or boosts... I've been stuck on the same level for a month now because I refuse to spend my hard earned money on a stupid game which is obviously set up to squeeze money out of you. Uninstalling asap!"", 'Board cheats. Credits that should be given for matching are not. How can you clear a board of all of one color and not change the score at all? Spending a lot of time on one task is not a fun game. I dont get why you game developers cant understand that. What is the point if you cant possibly win.', ""Do not understand why the emphasis on timers and limited number of moves. They detract from the game experience. Why not have an option of casual play with no limits on lives or time or moves. If hardcore players want all that fine otherwise have a setting that disables all. Don't care about rankings or how others are doing. Just want to enjoy the game. Uninstalling."", ""I'm going to be straight up it's fun in the beginning and they make you think that's it's going to be like this the whole game but in all honesty its awful because I've played in all my power ups to see if I would win either way but nope. This game is a joke they make you think that your gonna be playing a fun game but it's just frustrating. They should just delete this game because they're pretty much just trying to make you waste money so you can use more moves, it's just dumb. Uninstalling👎"", ""I'm actually very upset that when you earn unlimited lives for a certain amount of time you can't pause the time for later use. I earned a total of 13 hours after getting on a winning streak. You can't expect someone to play that long instead most of it was wasted. The unlimited lives timer should have a pause function."", 'It is outrageous that a game advertising one thing is a completely different experience from it. If it were a store over here it would be penalized for false ads, too bad I have no idea how to do that here. Other than that the game itself is rather okay if you have patience and are rich. Ridiculous how much you need to do/have for each ""harder"" level. It\'s stressful. I won\'t recommend it.', 'The game is ok but to expensive. After all you just pay for the priviledge to play this game that you used to buy for $50.00, now you pay continuously. Before you know it you have paid through the nose for a little entertainment. These types of games should be outlawed.', ""It's a fun game but it's like the game that's being advertised u dont pick the choices nothing on this game is what's the video showing that's what made me mad all u do is fix up his house and go to levels to try to win a star to be able to fix up his house etc nothing like the video at all need to stop falsely advertising and really show a video of the actual game"", ""The game is really well designed and fun, But levels get difficult so fast that you are pretty much forced to pay to proceed. I couldn't pass lvl 159 for days and unfortunately i am gonna uninstall the game even tho i liked it. Advice to dev, try to add more advertisement rather than forcing poeple to pay insanely expensive coins so that they can pass a level"", 'I downloaded the game because off the ads. It is completely opposite. An honest ad would get a honest review but I only have expectations vs reality. If I wanted to play candy crush then I would rate this a 5 star. Since I got the game based off the ads you get a 1 star for lying. Shame on you.', 'On level 2867, yet another with that stupid, damned corn in a can that keeps refilling itself. Frustrating, stupid feature that I already wrote to you about. Sometimes I make it through quickly; other times like now, it\'s an incredibly boring ""when is this stupid thing going to end"" frustrating exercise. Obviously I like the game, but until you do something about this inane feature...corn in a sardine can?!!!...you get 1 star. Level 3060: I HATE the corn! 1 star!', ""It's a 1/2 good/bad game but you have to have 900 COINS? How am I supposed to pay that!? And it takes SO long Its a good game but yeah......... Don't like the gameplay,controls or Graphics. It's very slow.It lags for 1 hour when l have VERY good internet/network.I recommend or do not recommend to play it. It's also boring. I DON'T MEAN BAD SO PLEASE DON'T TAKE THIS AS A SPAM OR INAPPROPRIATE"", ""It's just like any other match game, I was very disappointed that the advertising was all false. I was looking forward to the problem solving levels but there are none it's just break these block for stars then decorate the house."", ""Personally I love the game and I don't spend a dime on it. Once my lives run out I just wait til they refill. And I try to get the daily awards. Yes the levels get harder. But that's what makes it fun. Am at level 922 now."", 'So I have been playing for a while, but its clear why people hate this game. The levels dont go in a particular difficulty level so you can get stuck pretty easy, especially if you dont want to pay to win, frustrated, and quit.', 'I play as hard as I can to get the levels passed to do all the decorations. Then you have to go right back and do the same decorations in another way. The levels are hard enough to pass. Then it takes so many levels to get a decoration. No wonder players get discouraged and quits.', ""Could be fun. But they make things so difficult that it's not. You either struggle for days to do a task or buy their credits. It could be a good game but after less than a month of playing I am deleting the game."", ""I think when someone comes to the door you shouldn't have to do a challenge. Along with a trade of an object. Challenges are just to hard and makes the game just undesirable. Just getting tired of wasting time getting no where."", 'Fun at first, but has become frustrating & kind of boring. Decorating house is fun, but takes waaaaay to long to pass levels. Feel very forced to spend money. Sometimes go for days without being able to make any progress at all. Beginning to loose interest!!!', ""Frustrating and to hard .not enough choices to decorate your rooms it's a waste of time.not a fair play at all I've voiced my opinions but they still try and make the game so challenging it takes the fun out of the game."", 'Could you in your next update of game Homescapes the capability of turning off the timer. In candysmash. I have circulation problems in both hands, So the touch screens have trouble recognizing the touch of my fingersand and is slow to react causing more time to move objects than usual. Thank You', 'Fun to play. Just wish you didnt have to use points for trivial stuff like calling or meeting people. Would rather use points to ""fix"" the house. Otherwise its very enjoyable.', ""Going to delete game off because it takes too long to even come close to win. I have quit other games when it takes weeks to win. Don't mind the difficulty but can not enjoy a game when it is impossible to win. Good luck to those playing."", ""I love this game but I got s new phone and now it wasn't me to start from level 1 when I was so advanced close to level 200. I did connected to Facebook so they can save my levels. So what happened?. Please fixed this I do not want to lose all my progress."", 'Stuck on level 88 can go no higher game should give you tools to move up after repeated attempts at some point. Been stuck for weeks. I think I will quit & uninstall.', ""Some of the stages are made in such a way that if you don't spend money then you cannot beat it. Even some of the easy stages takes more than a day to beat it. You think you are playing but you are only moving the only possible move available. That's not playing bruh."", 'Really like this game, better than gardenscapes. I put a four because the game is fun, but the way that you earn stars gets a bit repetitive at times. I also think that homescapes is easier too earn stars on but will also start ro get hard at levels 35 onwards.']"

Im not sure about that, i think it was better the way you just collected the objects and they lasted the time of the selected minion, also i have completed all dispicable ops missions and althought there are still plenty of other ones to do, i would like more despicable ops missions added, other than that a very enjoyable and addictive game', ""So I played this game when it first came out and I loved it. I had it for about a year and then I got a new phone and hadn't played it since then. Yesterday I just got it again and I am very upset with what they have done. I dont mind the updates with the costumes and new coins. My problem is the missions I have to do. I just want to jump into the game and try and get the furthest I can. Now I have a mission to run for 15 seconds and your run ends. Very annoying. Bring back the old game"", 'It is a great experience that keeps my eyes locked to the screen on my free time . The only problem is that, Once the game becomes faster the controls get to b slower whereas they should speed up with the game . But anything else is just great ! ❤', ""This game is very addicting and quite creative. I play it every day, multiple times a day. However, it is not without it's flaws. When you play it as much as I do, you discover quite a few flaws and glitches. Developers, feel free to reach out to me and I will disclose as many as I can."", ""Great game, before it has tons of mb that eats up my storage and now it's saves much of my storage, plus it is addicting and funny, and good gameplay, but I really missed the preview of the minions and when you tap them it shows you a funny reaction, btw, great game"", ""Enjoyful game with nice graphics. The only thing that I don't really like is the ads. In most cases are optional but the reward is too good to ignore. So you end up seeing more ads than playing the actual game."", ""this game is good cuz you can run . Everything it's kind of like this other game I downloaded called Subway surfers the reason I give it 4 stars is because there was a glitchcan I see my brother's girl but now every time I get on it it goes away they only did once"", 'I am giving 5 stars because it is best and funny game because I can unlock funniest minions outfits and It is easy to buy prize pods by spending some tokens I have playing 6 months ago and I have unlocked 58 outfits In the first day of playing this game I have been 6 character THIS GAME IS TOO MUCH COOL AND BEST GAME EVER', 'the older version was better and now you cant play and just run for a long period of time you have to do missions and then the game stops you from running so you cant run anymore.', ""This game is fun and you guys have redesign the game completely i remember we used can buy banana with real money now you can't now in game has new recourses as silver tokens and gold tokens i like this game i can play this to west my free time everyday i will grind 1K of bananas everyday shouod be enough without spending the banana is hard to earn."", 'Its better than the old version. I can get more costumes than just buying them with real money. I have more chances with winning more prizes', 'I miss the old minion rush they could have left the old one and made this one minion rush mission impossible or something but the old one it was the game i would play it for hours and never get bored plz bring it.', ""Minion rush is a fun game you can do quests pick your own designed minion and also you can upgrade your quest and their are harder quests you can do and it's so fun and I enjoy playing this game!"", 'I used to love this game but now I hate it now that you are forced to end the game when you are forced to complete the mission. Bring back the old Minion Rush!', 'This is the best and cutest game I had ever played, the control is responsive and each minion have their own ability wow!! The minion looks very cute and very adorable I love those cute minion\U0001f929', 'This app is amazing because it makes some of the bosses easy unlike the other games and it is really fun to play,I recommend other people play it aswell!', 'Hi developer I am not able to find the game on playstore on mynvidia shield tv anymore. I have bought so many itemson itand feel like i have lost a lot of money. How can i play the game again on myshield tv or will i get refund for my purchases. Thanks', ""I love this game! The only doun side is that as soon as you finish your mission it stops your run. I just want to jump right in and go as far as I can. Please bring back the old one. Otherwise the game is fine. I hope I wasn't offensive to the makers of the game."", ""I've had a lot of fun playing this game since it came out, but it's been not so fun for the past year or so. The graphics just get worse and worse and it's getting slower. I understand my device is over 7 years old, but this experience is just unbelievablely awkward. I'll be switching to a new device for this. I never got too far through the game anyway."", ""I used to have the former version of the game which I loved but with this new version, I kinda hate it. First, you can't run endless. I used to love the challenge of running endlessly but now, it's boring. So please restore that. Second, WiFi isn't really common where I stay so when the first version had an are where you could access every location to download at a go, it was better then. But now, if I keep playing and reach a new level, I have to wait till I am where free WiFi is. So, restore."", ""I was playing this game for a long time few years ago when you need to get some fruits to pass the level and it was way better then this new version. I find it very boring and complicated now and it even doesn't work properly, every time i get to the slide it just stop working. I tried reinstalling it but it still have same problem. Please fix this and PLEASE GIVE US BACK THE OLD VERSION MINION RUSH"", ""I haven't played this game as much as I used to due to it being changed so much it doesn't feel like the same game, To bring help this game live longer plz add this feature called classic mode. It's this feature where it adds the shortcuts and no missions and also endless time and everything minion rush used to be like back in the day."", ""I can't even describe how good this game is. I play it almost every day and I get sucked into so much joy. This game has so many fantastic game features. There is over 80 costumes to collect and each one has their own special ability. I find this very unique and it makes you really want to get all of them. I could go on and on but since there is a limit to typing a review then this is all in going to say. Fantastic work Gameloft and all the game creators, and thank heavens for making this game"", ""I couldn't even PLAY the game, when i clicked on the start thingie it said something about,“ CONNECT TO GAMELOFT SERVERS” I waited for litterally 45 minutes and NOTHING!"", ""Prefer the old version. And I believe many people agree with me. Playing easy tasks that only last 30 seconds that aren't very challenging. liked it when you would complete the whole section and level up to a different type of theme in the game. It should have been a separate game meaning it should have been minion Rush two not just updating it so 2-year olds can only play it."", ""I love minion rush. So fun. Really gets your blood pumping. Not to many ads and if one sneaks in, it's a good break from all of the intense gameplay before. I love the upgrades that come with each minion and how you can compete online, and in different locations. The boss levels are rather thrilling as well. Overall a great game!!!"", ""Customes that give extra chances do nothing. I have a level 5 with 50% chance to find a moon and there is no difference. The charge ability is in an uncomfortable spot. Add a stronger sound when charged and options to move it in different spots . When abilities slow down the pace of the game it's annoying. Why not make everything at the same speed the minion is running? and why free revives are used automatically. It would be better if we could use them when we want like the charge abilities."", ""Dynamic, Fun, humorus and exciting are a few words to describe this, in comparism to many endless runner games, this game is by far better and it's arguably the best endless runner game i've ever played, because there is a variety of events and missions which most endless runner games don't have, everytime i open the game i have something new to play. In addition to that it's based on a popular animated movie franchise, there is a variety of customes and locations to choose from."", 'This game used to be fun. You could do special missions, unlock new places and villans, and you could play levels. In the newer update however, you never get to fight the villans, there are no levels, and you can only unlock characters which i had already bought in the old version. I wont rate it one star because its still a fun concept, but i wish it never changed', ""I've been playing this game for a month or two, but now this game has really turned very boring, the main mission in the game has been stuck for a week now asking me to open a character, the card for which never shows up... Nevertheless the game was really fun to play at the beginning, will install it again after few months.."", ""Very hard to complete any challenges when the tilting motion is not working. It is impossible to slide through w/o hitting an obstacle or falling into the abyss and having to spend coins to revive just to continue. (not to mention controlling the rocket function) It's ashame because I was looking forward to completing the Dragon Event for the new character costumes. Tried uninstalling and installing/updating the game but no luck."", ""The game is a very wonderful one... I personally never liked running games because they mostly just had one mission; keep running and eating coins till my friend introduced me to minion rush back in 2015 i juat couldn't get enough of it.. Theres different missions and activities to partake in.. There's some few things that need to be modified tho to make it more fun.. Getting tokens should be made easier and the stars we collect on the moon should be incoporated and made as valuable as tokens"", 'The graphics are good,very entertaning game and most of all i love minions!!!😘😘', ""It's really fun but last time I tried to play it the game just kept crashing but that might be a problem with my memory.

It turned a fun game into a full-on catastrophe. There are way to many directions and you can\'t play u til you die, you can only finish a ""mission"". Every time I said run again, it would bring to another direction page and tell me something new that I didnt ask for. When I finally started running, I ran for 2 seconds and then it froze and Grew came up and told me something about my character. Then Lucy came and did the same thing. 10/10 don\'t recommend. :(', ""Hi! I truly love this game however from past few days my game is having some glitches like I complete all task in challenge room but they automatically shows undone and I am not able to claim my daily rewards as well. I thought it might be because of updation but I checked my game is up to date. Please check it because it is hampering my experience and I don't wanna quit this game.

I am level 164 and I have never felt pressured to buy anything to level. I also like that there are so many little side quests and achievements to earn. I never feel bored. Some of the levels are extremely challenging but none of them have made me want to rage quit."", ""This is one of the best game apps I've played to date. Yes, there are ads you have to watch in order to gain boosts to help you progress, but they're kept relatively short, and the best part is that, while you Can pay to accelerate your progress, the game doesn't stall you to the point that you Have to pay. It's just challenging enough --- though I have to admit, I have cursed at it a few times! Lol"", ""Addicted, this game is fun and doesn't have a lot of ads. I did have one issue with a purchase though while playing in guest mode. Once I logged in with my Facebook account my purchase disappeared. They should ask if you'd like to save the latest or what's already on the cloud. So I must give a 4 star instead of a five."", ""Best game I have played in quite awhile! Its very challengimg & kinda better than Candy Crush & Diggy's Adventure!! My only negative is ya have to watch a few ads to get more keys & for the prize wheel. The Keys aren't bad cuz you watch 1 Ad for 2 keys; howeverthe wheel, you have to watch 1 Ad per spin & you only get 2 spins every few minutes or so. Sorry to say I don't spin the wheel that often. But honestly, this is a really good game! I love the cute bugs & slugs. Good Job Guys"", ""Highly addictive, adorable. Can be played on or offline and you don't have to spend money. Although some of the tougher levels can take time to bust playing free. But I played for over a year before buying a couple of little packs, and that was more because I felt I should given the destresser it had been for me. Top game guys, thank you SOOOOO much for it. 🤗."", 'The number of commercials I saw for the game was getting really annoying before and then it stopped pretty much. Then a month later I find I wish I had clicked it before 😅 it truly is a great game and annoying in the way that makes you say ""one more try""....12 times in a row (no joke. I literally did)', 'This game is soooo fun. I love that I can just casually play. And the biggest plus to me is that the game gives you the option to earn everything in the game to move forward you can spend Real money but you dont have to to keep going you can earn it playing yourself. The puzzles are challenging enough that you dont gwt super frustrated about losing and the characters are adorable. I recommend to all my friends!!!', ""BF is a great game with amazing graphics but don't be fooled by the difficulty of it. After level 600 or so the levels are sometimes ridiculously hard, meaning (in my case) you sometimes have to play a level more than 10 0r 15 times to win. It seems that often the levels are programmed to be deliberately annoying where you're always just that one move short to get the goals of which, imho, there are sometimes just too many to achieve in one level which makes playing very frustrating at times..."", 'I have been playing this game since 2018. I do not mind buying gold bars to help with the cost of maintaining the game. I complete the new levels every weekend and the new updates and challenges are always fun to finish and get the new characters. But now a new update has been added that boosts your power above others for an enormous amount of gold bars. I can not afford this. Others will now be able to buy their way to the top over those of us that actually learned to play the strategy game.', ""I personally love this game is really fun really good and it relaxes me you should have we play it and it don't worry about it and you didn't bother honestly sometimes I can get stuck to but it's so much fun you should 100-percent download it is one of the best things I have a really play on it but I love to play on it and then going on it more and more you should permit to in my pillow addicting her hey what else is it's better than anything else people get addicted to come on it's great. 😊"", ""As a person who loves strategic games, Best Fiends is the only strategic game I'll ever play. The graphics are outstanding, the characters are adorable, and the awards if you lose a level is amazing. I can never put my phone or tablet down when I play it because its so addicting. Best Fiends is my new addiction now."", 'Addicted but dont like setting up a play for you guys to come n scramble it, or putting those blk blobs to break the chain leading to an arrow (powerups) Thats the whole purpose of this game .. Setting it up, foreseeing the next move. Everything else is pretty nice.. Im a gamer and nvr met a game that ruins your fun like this ... I dont understand why..How is that lucrative? That makes ppl quit instead... Developers, plz work on trying to help us win (pleasant exp) and not block our moves.', ""It was a 5 star. I did a reset on my phone backing up app & phone data FIRST. When I restored everything, game was still in my phone but would not play. And even connecting to FB since day 1 was no help. It was not in my FB game list. I had to uninstall & reinstall and lost over 2800 keys, 80 gold bars, over 300,000 yellow meteormites, over 100,000 blue ones, and over 2000 diamonds. Oh! And I had to start at level 1 and I CAN'T save my keys like before. I'm forced to use them. 😠😠😠"", ""I don't know why the one who posted the whiny rant has a problem with ads being an issue when the game is free if you allow them. Don't want the ads, pay for the game you entitled crybaby cheapskate. The developers didn't put all of their time, know how and hard work into this for nothing. They made a good, fun game that we get to enjoy for free and make their money through ad revenue. Don't like their options? Don't play. Bitching about reality makes you look like the douche, not them."", ""My second review. I freaking love this game. It takes a Candy Crush kind of game to a whole new level. More stratedgy than luck which is what makes challenging and fun. Fun graphics, cool challenges, well written. Dont get me wrong I've spent a few dollars. If you play any game and expect not to your wrong. Spend it wisely here and you go far. Playing 6 months, spent maybe all in all 120.00. I'm at levey 1212. I just love the stratedgy required."", ""A familiar match 3 game with a fun monster collection mechanic. The problem is the monetisation. You have energy (recharges over time) to spend on playing levels. There are numerous time limited events that occur, which you can fail if you have to wait for energy to recharge (or sleep, work etc). Success and failure can be quite random on later levels. You can buy unlimited energy for an hour+. It's designed to force purchases and constant play to meet event goals. No permanent unlimited play."", 'Loses a star for being the only app I have (or have ever had) that has caused me to accidentally buy in-app stuff. Seriously\'s response to this is ""here is how to adjust your phone\'s settings to avoid this"". Meanwhile I don\'t have to alter any settings to prevent accidental purchase in ANY other app. The implication is that they won\'t address this issue, because getting people to accidentally buy stuff is lucrative.', ""I had high hopes for this game (I really did). Unfortunately: 1) the user experience is atrocious, especially on a phone, 2) the ads are non-stop and blatantly in-your-face to buy Buy! BUY!!, and 3) the game quite obviously and directly ensures you need to pay to play (in other words, it cheats). I've played dozens of games, this is the worst one BY FAR for cheating."", ""A very fun mobile game. Not focused on pay to win. Despite have an energy bar, it easily recharges through the many challenges the game have. Cute bugs and....amphibians? Very fun concept and have a gotta catch em all concept inspired from pokemon. Overall a fun game and and that's saying a lot when talking about mobile games. May this company thrive and create more fun games"", 'Since the last update it WON\'T EVEN STAY OPEN! It takes my life credits and then shuts down! I absolutly love this game however since the last update it constantly crashes! It shuts down everytime I submit my ""life credits""! :( I wish this issue would get resolved ASAP!! VERY DISAPPOINTING! Guess I\'ll go find a different game to spend my money on!! :(', ""It's kind of cute. But some levels take too long to beat, so I give up. I just don't have money to keep dumping into it if I get stuck. It would be nice if we could win or earn bombs or something that we could use in a pinch instead of playing one level for three hours and then giving up. BUT it passes the time if you have some you need killing"", ""This game is one of my favorites! The little characters are cute and colorful. The game is easy to play and easy to understand. The game also gives you enough of a challenge to not be so simple that it's boring. There are plenty of levels especially in the higher levels where you lose and have to play the level a few times until you can pass it."", ""Honestly the best video game of all time. You just never get bored of it. The only negative thing is that I'm addicted to it (which is not really a bad thing for the game). Also it's totally not candy crush. So for those of you who are like me and dislike candy crush, and also do not have a life (like me) should totally download this game. So fun!"", 'Honestly this game has a great concept. That being said it isway to heavily pay to win. After level 100 you have to replay multiple times per level to progress because of deliberate poor level design trying to trap you into buying gold to get extra moves because the limit is far to low for the difficulty of the level. Really disappointed in it because like I Sai great concept, poor execution.', ""I honestly only started because of the mist app, but it's pretty fun. I like that I can generate VIP time by participating in events as opposed to paying money for in game currency, so if I want to play several matches in a row im not blocked by the energy system. makes the energy system only affect you if you spend all energy trying, and failing, to beat a lvl, but let's be honest you might need a break at that point. Good for mist points too because they're generated by time in game. 😁👍"", ""So fun and addicting! Had this game since Sep 16 2019 and it still keeps me super engaged even when I have trouble passing a level. The levels progressively get harder but I think the levels really reached their truly difficult stage once I passed level 600. (Currently on level 824 and haven't purchased anything for this game btw)"", ""I like how I can upgrade my feinds just by playing. I don't have to buy anything. Fun game. Challenging but not too much. [Update 2/10/20. It gets harder. One can spend hours even days on one level. That gets frustrating. --- But I still enjoy playing the game.]"", ""Love this game! It's fun and can be really time consuming though. But its perfect when you are bored and want time to fly by faster or you can't fall asleep so just play a few games and in no time will feel tired and sleepy and pass out lol"", 'love this game... very addictive and challenging It has a good support group.. my phone had crashed on me..when I got it back on I went back to the game and it started me all over to level 1... I contacted support..and they put me back were I was....VERY HAPPY...😉', 'I LOVE this silly game! No more match three games! This is a great twist on the match 3 game. The little critters are adorable and I really enjoy the different quests, like raising a baby slug, hahahaha! Great game for all ages!', ""I love this game, but I wish you could earn gold faster, and you should not lose your gifts and energy when you win VIP status, we still need them once our time is up. I'm hoping to see this change soon."", 'Best fiends is good game, leveling your fiends the rewards sytem is satisfying But some of the levels are really unfair not gonna lie, its really unfair i have to use the gold to get passed the level , 20 moves isnt enough Im putting a 1 star because they need to fix this problem of unfairness', ""Don't like a lot of these games. However. I can dig this one. Fun And there is some thought process that has to go into it but not a whole lot once you've learned it. I would recommend the game and have been recommending it to friends."", 'Great game! Just have fun and relax. They give you so many opportunities to keep playing without paying a dime. Customer friendly game! I had a purchase issue and they resolved it in roughly two hours! Excellent customer service unseen these days.', 'Great Game!! Fun, exciting, challenging, and funny mini-movies to watch! This is a great and novel idea..... make a game people like without making them spend all of their paycheck! I will be playing this game for a long time!! Great Work!', ""Played game when it first came out and really enjoyed it, I just didnt have the time to play anymore. I was pretty happy with it again after downloading till I ran into levels that you HAVE to purchase fiends in order to beat, that's messed up."", ""This game is a lot of fun! I haven't stalled out, even though I haven't made in-app purchases. The fiends are adorable. They all have little backstories and personalities, so it's fun when I find a new one."", ""Thoroughly enjoy this game it's really addictive, the graphics are great but my favourite part is all the little creators you get to collect and watch them evolve it's also great at how quickly you up enough diamonds and meteorites to upgrade your creators over the levels"", ""I like it. You don't have the traditional match 3. You can choose a connecting available path to string a match together. It works more of the brain than traditional match games."", 'Updated from 1 star to 5 stars... Originally, in March 2019, had lots of issues & terribly disappointed. Tried it again in Dec 2019 and have enjoyed playing ever since. Can be pleasantly challenging and distracting. 👍']"

New exciting levels and rewards!","[""Sigh!!!!! I really am soooooo tired of this game, I am uninstalling this game and any others like it. I have been stuck on the same stupid board for 3 months. Level 406 , I have attempted this level over 300 times and failed every one, have not even come close. All these games are is a giant blood sucking money pit, I refuse to ever give any of them my money. This game I'm done with"", 'Great game with terrific graphics and interesting levels to play. I only gave it 4 stars in my revised review because of the frustrating reward system. The game gives only fractions of rewards -- points towards a booster instead of granting the whole thing. E.g. only giving a few points toward a lollipop hammer for completing a quest, whereas other Candy Crush games reward players with the whole hammer. This is very frustrating because it is harder to earn boosters this way.', ""Fun but too expensive. And why offer hours of boosters with no way to buy play time in the packs? Coins are too expensive. Not enough specials and daily prizes are terrible. Also it's too long between turns. It's a stingy game. 5 weeks later - It's gotten much better as far as winning boosters goes. But still stingy when it comes to coins. There's no way win extra lives and there's too long between them."", ""This game is so much fun! It's addictive. The only thing I'd change, would be, it would be nice if we had the ability to watch a video and earn a extra turn or points. sometime all I need is one more turn to win the level. I can't afford to buy credits. Not to mention, there are way too many levels! This game sometimes get boring and tetious! I feel like I will never be done!"", 'Brilliant pure brilliant but a challenge.getting harder. It is really important not to miss a a move or a make a simple mistake .you just have to keep playing, great fun.geting harder by the day great challenge, keep it up. Really addictive love it. Still loving it. Thanks ,it is still awesome. It just gets better and better. Keep it up you are doing great. Getting harder. Keep it up you are doing great. Still here love the game.', 'Very fun game but inconsistencies make it less fun. You give pregame boosters, and a continuance with watching a video. But they are not always offered, only a few times then they stop. They should always be offered and available. This is why I changed my rating from a 5 down to 3 stars. Be more consistent, offer the pregame boosters and the continues on EVERY game!', ""I have been playing saga for a long time, on level 6210. I started playing friends when I was waiting for new levels to come out.The strategy is alot like saga BUT it is VERY FRUSTRATING to have to play a friend level sometimes 40, 50, 60 times just to win. Buying extra moves would be pointless. Some levels you aren't winning until you get a lucky board. I don't care about costumes or characters. A way to earn CBs or coloring candies is needed. I have NEVER played a saga level even 15 times."", ""It's better than the other versions. I still stand by my original review however I don't find it fair that some players are allowed to watch ads to earn boosters before the game starts or watch ads to earn extra moves when you run out of them I'm doing just fine without this feature but when I get too a difficult level it would be nice to have the option like some players do."", 'Great game but once you pass into level 1000 the game gets boring. There are no new characters, no new costumes, no events... Just get daily rewards, daily missions and play. No insentives and a lot of the fun of the game disapears. Such a shame after working so hard to advance so far. Hoping this can be fixed in future!!', ""Super fun better then the others but unfortunately the last update took everything. No videos for extra lives and no extra 4 moves. Please fix this..otherwise awesome. Update...2/19 everything came back my 4 extra men and refill lives and so on was so excited after 3 months without. Now it's gone again had it for 1 day and my husband's never dissapeared at all this whole time. What in the world is going on?"", ""4 stars because of one issue all of your players have, Why do we have to pay for our gold from the piggy bank when we already own it? I win gold after each level but am not allowed to touch it unless i pay real money!! Please get rid of this issue, I don't mind watching ads to help you pay for the upkeep of this game I have no problem with it but I'm not paying cash for coins that are mine already..but even with this issue this is THE BEST OF ALL THE CANDY CRUSH GAMES BY KING...good job."", ""I've had a blast for a few years now with all Candy games that are out there. This one is my favorite. Lots of bonus and rewards and even most of the hard levels you get help so you don't feel like it's not possible to get to the next level. If you are tired and feel hopeless on those other Candy games, this one you might want to try."", ""Good game as it keeps idol hands & mind busy especially when one is laid up & not well. still all good. Still keeping my idol moments entertained. Just ticking along fine now. Certainly tests the patience, in a good way. All AOK. Still Yahoo.

Bring back the free life, quest rewards , alot of the time you collect enough stickers for a 2 hr booster but have no lives to play. Also bring back rewards for ad watching. Other than that its a good game', 'Fun exercise for your thinking and sight. I really enjoy playing when I cant sleep. I enjoy playing and challenging my grandchildren. We challenge who can get the highest points and who can break the most in one move. The characters are so cute. Specially when it dances.', ""Stay away from the pig. It's not worth it. AMAZING how you, the developer finds ways to continuously charge us, the consumers!! You want us to pay YOU to break the piggy bank that supposedly holds accumulated gold bars (current rate is $3.99). We do such expecting something for our money only to get ZIP!!! THE MONEY YOU CONSTANTLY RECEIVE FROM US GOES STRAIGHT TO YOUR POCKET AND WE RECEIVE NOTHING. Gold bars never go into my gold bar account, they just vanish and soon after you want more piggy"", 'I\'m on level 1508 and all of my earned ""friends"" were taken away to have me go through and win then all again accept now all of the friends I can choose from for this level I apparently haven\'t won yet and I have no way to get them.

I recommend this game to people who are bored😊 Im telling u now download Candy Crush Friends Saga for free now! ❤️💜💙"", ""I enjoy playing this game. I stopped for a long time because the levels got to hard to complete and when you get stuck on one level forever. Well I just stopped playing. Now I'm trying it again and I got past the level and it's better this time.. so thank you very much."", 'I am thoroughly enjoying the candy crush game in fact its getting a bit addictive. Great game I am trying to go as far as I can without losing any lives. I think the characters are really comical and the voices are making me laugh out loud. Keep up the good work thanks for a rib tickling game Karl 👍', 'the game is noticabley RIGGED to leave to you with no moves and only a single blocker stopping you from beating the stage on so many stages its discusting. The game deciedes when you are ""allowed"" to pass a stage and throws combo after combo when previous 25 tries you could get no where close... thats proof enough for me to NEVER SPEND A DIME on this game.. heck you cant even send and recieve lives on this version only, cmon now we are not all idiots . PS your app reviews look very fake', 'things are waaaay too expensive & the things you earn thst last 2hours always seem to happen when you have 1 live left so you have to pay to continue. im enjoying but its too pricey so am thinking of deleting as there are similar games that dont charge so much. Dont like paying for gold bars ive earned 3 times the game has just frozen in an hour wasted my lives and power up - feel cheated', 'I wish you could ""bank"" the daily rewards earned, even for 24 hours. I play this in my free time, which dies not always mean I have an hour of game time. If I do not, most usually, the rewards are wasted by the time I am able to play again.', 'Too many effects, nerve wrecking. Gave me a headache even with all sounds turned off. The dance at the end of a level is ridiculous. I will go back to good, calm Soda Crush. This seems over childish and way too noisy', ""I enjoy the game. I wish when the characters upgraded, their powers upgraded as well. It's stupid that they only get a different outfit. Who cares what they're wearing, especially when it takes so long to do it. Give more opportunities to earn power ups."", 'Interesting. Started the Android version of this game at same time I started the iPhone version on phone. Android version much worse than iOS. Level 998 on iOS ND level 658 on andoid., An I play more on the tablet. No idea why iOS us s O much more playable', 'As much as i like this game, its eating my phone space a lot. To many updates and nothing very new to see accept for the time you added new level. No new features, no new graphic only new level from time to time, so, too many updates with nothing new is too annoying', ""Please PLEASE remove the countdown timer when quiting a level. What if I press the back button unknowingly when I'm one move away from finishing a difficult level, then I quit automatically after the SHORT 3 SECOND TIMER. That's just poor game design. Just use a normal quit menu WITH NO TIMER."", ""With friends this candy crush game is terrific. I love this game \U0001f970 I'm loving these intensed levels. Still loving this game 5 stars continues. The game Is getting harder in som levels. But loving the challenges. I still love this game with all those friendly charators. With new ones coming its great."", ""I generally like the game I play it everyday but I don't understand how you decide the teams and why I am always put in groups of people who dont seem to even play when we do team challenges such as the one going on now where we earn points for playing and finishing levels I've done nearly the whole thing myself playing daily I haven't even made it to the first gift seems unfair for us players that are dedicated"", ""I would like to be able to activate the timed rewards at my convienance. I play late at night and always earn the two hour reward and can't use it all. Characters that break ice or things should always hit a square with ice if there are any left."", 'love it. great to past the time .... still love it.. 2019 still i love it.. love more as i keep playing... i dont like that the daily rewards keeps taking me back to 1 when i miss a day. I still feel the same.', 'September 2019 i was in Level 526 four months later I am on Level 992 eight level shy of 1000th Level of this game that shows you how much i am really enjoying this game.

This game is #1', 'l just love this game... the little grafics are soooooooo cute...l dropped Sugar crash...it got borings.. keep up the great work...as days go by.. the game gets better.. thanks..as I said before I will keep playing this game for a long long time.🍀🤗💕 this is a 5🌟 plus+++ Game..', 'the game is stuck at level 1333 .I can not purchase play on moves or collect daily gifts. Every time I try I get an error has occurred. please fix this problem. Thanks', 'Great game. Love the characters, love the graphics and pace of play. Probably my all-time favorite app. One other thing, this game doesn\'t seem to carry an ""agenda"" as all my other games do.', 'Love this game. Cute characters. You can choose different characters to play the game with you to increase your chances of winning. The character that is recommended is not always the character who wins for you.', ""😀Its Great! very good entertainment the more you play n win the better it gets! 💯👍 This is my 2nd review as I go further to higher stages im close to 300, 🎈🎊💕 and it just gets better n more addictive..

Have fun!","[""Game was great in the beginning, but now after reaching level 11, the game has stalled, and the characters aren't speaking, except to order, and are not giving recipes. I've got delivery orders that are stalled because there is a drink that I don't have a record or equipment for, and the star rating for my cafe has stopped despite filling orders. If anyone knows how to fix this, please help."", ""Really fun game! I love the stories and missions, and how it's relatively easy to work your way up the levels and build your cafe. Also, although the game does have options where you can buy stuff, its definitely not a pay to play. You can get to any level and at the same time spend little to no money, which is an amazing thing considering so many games these days require you to keep cashing in money to be able to continue playing. Overall, I love this game! Keep up the good work, Melsoft!"", 'Honestly, I really do love this game, but I\'ve recently been extremely disappointed with the ""invite rewards"" and the help chat. First of all, I invited a friend and even though she completed the requirements, I didn\'t receive my reward. Then when I chatted with help, I eventually stopped getting any responses. I understand help boys are limited, but it didn\'t even tell me what would happen now. I really hope this gets resolved, but I\'m doubting it. If it does, I\'d definitely change this review', ""Equipment is WAY TOO EXPENSIVE!!!! I love this game, it's so fun to play, but you lose so much money due to not having an ingredient that it's getting ridiculous. $440,000 for coconut shavings, like come on! I could buy enough coconuts to shave my own for 2% of that money. It's stupid. I could understand a bit of a price increase for each new thing, but it went from $220,000 for the last piece of equipment to $440,000 like really!!! and there is no way to purchase more gold to get more things"", 'Well, i can say this a decent game sans one issue, i have read several reviews that say the the machines are quite overpriced; those reviews are absolutely correct, take the whipped cream machine as an example, ingame, it cost around 2800 coins, or 170 gems. Given the slow rate you earn coins, the game will become boring and slow. The worst part of this is that the devs REFUSE to fix the prices, with the excuse of a ""positive challenge"" when it\'s just negative frustration.', ""This game is good but cannot say it is very good because when level increase points will become slow so I gave this game three star. I know 50 percent of you like this game. Some like cooking very much but it is not a cooking game. It is a game that cook it's own. Only we need to help them.I know 10 or 15 percent of people like this game. Now play this game once do you like give it five star rating and give description about this game thank you and have a nice day."", 'This game is utter BS. You literally have to start buying almost everything with your own money if you want to actually go past level 9, otherwise you are stuck with missions that require you to buy things with your own money so you can finish them. Some items are for ""VIP"" meaning that you have to pay to be VIP and purchase the items otherwise no progress. I wouldn\'t recommend this game to anyone because its basically a rip off', ""This game is great but just exploitative for real money. Most games will give you options to use real money but also give you a small in-game way to earn same rewards without using real money. The in-game route is usually slower but it's still available to use... Not my café!!! To get VIP levels, you must use real cash, the same gift bags they sell for real money will give you VIP points but when you earn it via the game, it comes without VIP points... To cancel a festival task costs 50 diamonds"", 'For the first 10ish levels this game was fun but that did not last. Problem one is that as you increase in levels the things you need to buy become insanely expensive and the amount you earn does not match this. Also while you are away from the cafe you earn less than when you are there, which is really annoying because gameplay when you have no money is BORING. Next certain spices you either need to wait to maybe win or become a VIP which costs money. VIP should be an add on not a requirement.', ""I enjoy playing My Cafe so much that I play it daily. I'm so happy that the developers updated the music and added more features and storylines. The one thing that I would suggest is allowing us to rotate the furniture in four different directions rather than just two directions because the lack of directions restricts us from customizing our Cafe's the way that we want. To the developers: Please kindly consider this. Thank you 😊"", ""This game is awesome. I love the way you have to discover stories and talk to the customers and the customers help you with ingredients and the good thing is,it is a real challenge to fulfill their orders and get amazing rewards. Also when you get to level 7 you can join a township and compete in festivals to win amazing prizes to help you cafe. You can win coins, diamonds, simple gifts, pink gifts, blue gifts,gold gifts and spices. I would totally recommend downloading this game it's the best."", ""Downloaded this game to give it another try. I remembered why I uninstalled it. At first its fun, then later on through the game when you have to do spices, it takes a while. Most of the spices are 15 diamonds for just one spice. Would be better if one spice could be 1-2 diamonds each instead. But you got a tv to watch ads to earn 1 diamond. Not worth it. And money takes time, but I don't mind that."", ""The game was quite addictive for a while but it's expensive to keep playing. You fly through the levels quickly and each new level requires the purchase of new equipment which is always super expensive. There are few ways of earning diamonds , which means you end up spending too much real money to progress. It's frustrating as you go up in levels. The developers are just greedy. 50 diamonds to cancel a festival task, 41 diamonds for a gold spice among other ridiculous prices."", ""Im a bit annoyed that when a car comes along with orders, i cant complete them due to needing to increase level of an equipment. There shouldnt be an order for something if you haven't got the equipment or need to increase level. Equipment is way to expensive to buy and some people cant afford to spend real life money on a game to help them progress. Good game but jezz talk about making things expensive to the point you have to spend real money just to get anywhere. Disappointed."", ""This game was fun at first! But only one diamond per ad? And 1-3 diamonds rarely from a customer? That's unfair and it gets boring! I know you get money from ads, but one diamond per ad doesn't seem very rewarding. If you put five diamonds per ad, then people would watch it more. And the price on some ingredients and equipment are just insane! I don't like playing games that are a pay to play. And don't give me the positive challenge thing. BRUH I said don't give me the positive challenge thing."", ""Very nice game but prices of the equipment are ridiculous and extreme. They make no sense. Millions in the double digits for necessary items like a blender. Holidays spill over into other seasons. Not so good storylines. Too much with Facebook if you aren't with Facebook. Complicated weekend festivals that aren't worth getting involved with yet they try and get everyone into it. Nice otherwise, but less social media."", 'Such a great game! Everything you could wish for. You\'re not stuck somewhere if u aren\'t paying for something - not at all a pay to win game. There are ads but only if u want to watch them (for example if u want to get a diamond for free or another daily ""prize""). Can\'t find anything that annoys me. REALLY RECOMMEND IT!!! Those games are extremely rare. (Usually I don\'t post any review but My Cafe deserves every support there is)', ""Not a biggest fan of the story mode so I do tend to skim over it a little, but I just spent 199 diamonds on something that isnt even relevant to me!! I spent my own money on this game and now I'm left with 35 diamonds. I dont know why this option is in the game to give it to random customers and not even have a tab ask if you're sure"", ""This game is so much fun! The way how you can choose dialogs,styles for the cafe, recipes and the prices that you can change! I like the story line to... it's fun! I just think there should be animals/pets for the.cafe to just add little spice... but further on is it a great game... probably of my favourites"", ""it's a great game but i do agree with the other players that have commented and from what i see in ur responses is for them to do the phone orders instead of ya'll doing something about the game. In my opinion, it's not fair to ignor their concerns about the game. Also ya'll set the game to where the players have to pay to play when they get to a certain lvl in the game. not everyone can afford to pay for diamonds , coins and etc."", ""Losing interest in this game because I could not progress. It says in my screen that the game has maintenance even there's none. Seems like this game is bugged at level 14 quests. I spent for this game also, so that clearly I can progress faster since quests get expensive and absurd to achieve if not for paying money, which I don't mind much. Please fix this because I'm stuck and I'm sure some players experience the same thing. Reinstalling, clear cache, done it all, still not working."", 'I USED TO quite enjoy this game except when things don\'t work and support won\'t help. Barista challenge has never worked for me and ""support"" has been absolutely useless. I contacted them in game and by email. They claimed someone would be assigned to it 3 days ago. Still waiting. UPDATE: After 6 days of me sending messages they finally responded and were rude. They blocked my request. I\'ve now sent a third support ticket. They are rude to everyone apparently.', ""I'm at level 5, so far the best part of the game is the story aspect. I find the gameplay slow. The characters animation makes them look like puppets. Earning money for upgrades is painfully slow, so reading the story becomes the only entertainment, because I have no hope of building my cafe with such a low income."", 'This is an app that is nearly impossible to progress in without spending money. Lots and lots of money. Spices have to be thrown out unless you unlock extra room in the spice box for gems. The only real way to make money is by creating speciality drinks with spices, which all cost genes. Lots of gems.', ""50+ million installs eh? Every single time there is an issue..which is ALL THE TIME, the advice is to 'reinstall the game'. Some of the ads give you no option to exit out unless you install whatever they are advertising. Not professional at all! The help pages online give the same advice over and over..buy diamonds (you can click refresh orders! or REINSTALL.) 1 Star and getting ready to UNinstall."", 'Great at first. Then progress is so slow. You cant get diamonds for spices and therefore cant level up past level 10 without spending real money. I do not have Facebook so please do not tell me to go there. The makers of this game need to read these comments since several people have the same issue and end up deleting the game because of it.', ""Have been playing for a month now, currently VIP 2. While the game's concept is fun, it's obvious that many features are rigged to get players to spend real-world money. Also having customers immediately requesting menu items from ingredients the player cannot afford, especially after levelling up, feels like the game wants to punish the player. Will continue to play for the story quests, but am on the lookout for other, hopefully more relaxing games which treat players better."", ""I enjoy this game but it has been glitching. Kroffsky won't come back to the cafe and I have a task with him. It's been 3 days and he hasn't come back. Margret keeps asking for a cinnamon cupcake to finish telling her story about animals but when I go to give it to her, there's no option for her to accept it. It won't allow me to give it to her. The app is up to date so IDK what's going on but it's preventing me from completing tasks."", ""It was a very fun game in the beginning but when i reached level 6 i don't know if its a bug but i can't make any money. The money kind of just freezed and its not filling even though i didn't play the game for many hours it would still make profit but now it's not making any money when i go away. Plz fix this. I've already uninstalled this game and not gonna play until you fix it."", ""Fun and easy. I feel like you just make the game where customers only ask for special dishes with the special spices you have. I could get 4 out of 5 for having all the other spices then get to 5 out 5 and I can't complete it because I don't have gold. Also I shouldn't lose profit because I don't have a machine. It's 440,000 coins to get coconut on level 20 and I had to get a cafe expansion the level before which cost 100,000."", 'The game is really good but it takes so long to get coins or just to buy new space boxes for the spices. I cant do anything at the moment as I have no space for spices and no coins. I Hate in app purchases!! Its no fun, when all you have to do is buy yourself to the next level! 🤔🤔🤔😔 Its not fair and the process is slow', ""Update Again: So i continued to play and the devs were right, they give you everything you need but you do need to stratagize as well. They have so many ways to gwt spices and diamonds. Don't give up, the updates and graphics are amaze, yes tec supoort is not the best but you can always find what you need on their official facebook page. Their staff is super nice and very helpful. Every game has it's flaws but at the end of the day, everything has flaws. I absolutly love this game."", ""Love the game but you guys need to lower these prices! Its difficult to earn enough coins before leveling up & having to buy the required equipment. Other than costly items, the game is great! I see everybody complaining about the same thing & we just get told to complete phone orders which tbh, that doesn't give much coins! Lowering prices WILL NOT MAKE IT BORING & IT WILL NOT CAUSE US TO FINISH THE GAME FASTER! Just add more storylines on future updates instead of ending at lvl 38."", 'You CANNOT advance without spending real money. Otherwise it takes FOREVER. The game developers are terrible! Employees hired get in the way more than they help. Way better games out there that guarantee progression without pickpocketing. Shame on this company for the lies spewed on Home Design offers. You all can gfy🖕🏻', ""This is a good game, but it is way too big. I have to delete 200+mb of data just to update it, and you can't play the game without updating it. I'm a township leader and it's ridiculous that I can't access the game during a festival. Edit: why is there another big update almost immediately after the first one?"", 'it hits a point where some things force you to spend diamonds. As well as the cost to expand your cafe becomes increases ridiculous each level. UPDATE: Thank you for response. But phone orders do not give you much spices or a wide enough range, to actively level up AND expand cafe while purchasing equipment. Sometimes to level up customers make you buy things. Otherwise it takes AGES to complete all using XP from orders. You could be playing for MONTHS and go almost nowhere :/', ""I love this game but unless you pocket out heaps of your own money, you don't really go anywhere. It's a shame because it is really fun. Perhaps if the developers lowered purchase prices, it would be better. The developers just seem money hungry."", ""The only thing i don't like about this game is the exorbitant amount of coins you need to pay for new equipment at each level!! The past level's tasks literally drain you of all your resources and you gotta bear so much loss due to lack of machines in the next. Really motivates me to leave the game sometimes"", ""This is a very fun game but I am a new leader's assistant and I was giving my team there earnings this morning and there was a glitch in chat and made it look like everyone got triple. I was very confused as it was my first time giving out rewards I hope you fix this glitch"", 'I like different stories of the game and while playing it , many task are automatic in the operation. You dont have to worry about the time. I just have one suggestion ,please reduce the prices of the products and materials in the games. Thanks']"

*Game is now compatible for OS 4.1.0 and up","['I played this game for over a year. I put in all energy spins and bombs just to be reset. Lost 1600+ spins, billions of coins and when I contacted them they offered me 760 spins for my troubles. I am not the only person I know that has had that problem. They dribbled out the spins after a week of complaining. 760, then 3 days later 500, then 340. But the first 2 expired before they actually awarded all. Since I had uninstalled the first 2 expired and they dont care.', ""Very enjoyable game in sporadic bursts! Except it glitches on me and then I lose out on fun things. Finally got to the water themed game where you get 3 chances to break gems and it froze and I lost the opportunity to play because it went back to 0. This is the second time it's done this to me. It also advertises a bunch of things that never actually show up as playable options. If those are based on having to be a certain level it should probably say that."", ""I love this game and am on it multiple times a day. I'm over level 1000 and I still enjoy playing. It's great for a quick get away when you have a three month old. I would only say it's hard to keep track of the tournaments when they fo on. You get the pop up when you first log in but there is no way to see what you are early or to check your standing from what I can tell. This is a big negative in my book. Please make this easy to check and follow along."", ""Even after recent update, I'm still not able to watch the free video. I have restarted my phone and the game but I'm not able to watch the frr video to get coins or spins. I just updated this game yesterday and I'm not able to get anything done! It won't let me watch any videos for free, it's taking all of my spins and saying no internet connection! This has only been a problem since the update! I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app and restarted my phone."", 'This used to be fun until I spent money on it. Every since I spent money, now I get nothing for free. Its not fun to spin a wheel a few times and get some money you can do nothing with. It used to be that you got cards, bombs to play other games, the deep sea extra spins. Now, I get my spins and it just lands on the $ ones and hardly ever anything else. When it lands on the deep sea, its never enough to actually get to spin the extra wheel, then it expires and you start over.', ""I had 15 islands on this game when I woke up this morning. Just take a few hours rest so I can have more spins after. But when I open this game apps, I'm surprised that I came back to the start! All the prizes I earned from the bomb games are nowhere to be found too. I'm starting to enjoy this game and no complains from the developers until what happened today. I hope any technical support from the developers can recover my data. If they can, I would gladly change my review to this."", ""I used to really enjoy this game. They made it fun and you could still win if you played often without buying and because of that I was willing to make a purchase now and again... Because I didn't feel like I was forced to pay to play. That is no longer true and my enjoyment of the game is dropping rapidly. Keep it up and I'll likely quit altogether. Edited to add: I got a response to my review a month shy of a year after I left it! Swell customer service, really on the ball! NOT! From 3 to 2 *"", ""This is the worst game I have ever played. Do not waste your time. Firstly, the spins aren't even a random number generator. They are rigged to give you the worst prize more than half the time. They also drastically slow your progress once you get going. I downloaded this app to earn free credits for another game. They erased my progress when I got to the 40th island (I needed to complete the island to meet the requirement). I wish for physical harm to befall the creators of this game."", ""I loved this app in the beginning! Now its saying it cant connect me to the internet. Something about my connection but I have perfect signal!! I've installed and uninstalled numerous times! What can I do to fix this issue?!?"", ""This was my favorite game when I first started playing it. Now you are lucky if you can play 10 minutes at a time before you run out of spins. You can have 300 spins and you constantly land on the smallest dollar amount. It costs tons to build your islands and it just can't be done for days. Because of this I took the 5 star rating away"", ""I am now rating this app from 1 star to 5 stars. My problem was that I logged in one day and I basically didn't exist. I figured out long ago, that I hadn't logged in the same as I had always done previously. Heck, I didn't realize there was an option. That being said, I just started playing a new game. I love this game as it allows me to escape for short periods. I have several games on my phone however, this is the only one I ever play anymore!"", 'I\'ve been playing a couple of months now and in the beginning winning was frequent. There are 10 spaces in the board and I am up to 120 spins when at full capacity. Outside of the bonus $ spot, there are ""3"", yes only 3 spaces without some form of other prize plus $. I have been keeping track of my % the last week or so of how many times I actually got a prize or just $. I\'ve got strictly $ 70% more times than a prize plus $. And there are only THREE $ only slots on the board.', ""Last week they did an update that caused progress to be reset. After finding I'd lost my game they said they would restore my new account to the same level. 6 days later, another help ticket, and 3 emails and they have yet to do so. I downloaded this through Tapjoy for an award. Do not bother. They will reset you before you achieve the milestone for the award. Do not trust!"", ""I love this game but many time i dont received the daily coins and spin that's so bad because i can not buy any item without the daily bonus its so expensive how can i buy it u should know that we play for fun like this we will be bored You have to facilitate the game or help the player not get tired of the game ty"", ""Very hard to log in this game. I'm not recommended to those people that use 4g below. This game usually needs 5g above to play. I don't think the developer of this game doing they job done. I have play this game a long time and there is no progress in solving logging problems. You can try, if you don't believe me. I'm sure you will disappoint how this app/game is...."", ""Got all the way to 106 until I realized how much of my money is going down the drain. In order to win or score high in challenges, you must pay money cuz the options you have to get free spins &coins don't ever give enough and the challenge events dont have much time to complete. Recently, I have been experiencing the bug where it doesn't connect to the servers and it eats my spins! I am literally spending money to have the spins disappear with no reimbursement on the systems end. App deleted!"", ""By the looks of it, the devs are just as useless. Reset from about Island 35. Mind giving my progress back please? I was on a guest account (I have a screenshot of what my game name was). I find it stupid I invested so much time into this to find it a waste. Why bother making a game if the game doesn't work, just like the developers?"", ""This garbage is rigged!!!!! Keep an eye on your spins as you're using them because it will take away double on 1 spin!!!! The spins are rigged also. I spun 13 times in a row and only 2 wedges were empty and 6 had prizes on them....i got the empties EVERY TIME!!!! Those odds are impossible unless it's rigged!!! I spend lots of money on this game but not anymore. Go play island Kings... At least it's a little more honest and rewarding!"", ""It's a good game but only 3 energy for the things you can do like steal and attack give more for those so people can play more and I had about 8,000 spins all landed on the cash one which was a couple million but with all those spins it just kept landing in the same two spot got to switch it up if you want people to play more"", 'It is really bad when you like to playing this game and all it does and says it can not connect no internet.. i have other games that i play and never ever have problems with... fix your game its on your end not mine... i have internet connection.. the problem is on your end fix it...', ""This game does not deliver when you purchase things and it has had connection issues for over 4 months now & it doesn't look like anything is really being done to fix it. I would never recommend this game & sorry I wasted my time & even more sorry I wasted money on this game. **** I have sent several messages about my issues * nothing has been done about it. I can see that writing a bad review doesn't get you anywhere either*** this game sucks & customer service is horrible** 0 stars if I could"", 'According to the high level we required more money and spin, 120 spins are not enough to complete game . Also required more bomb to destroy one island according to level or else u can decrease level as per bomb or else can provide more bomb. Game sometime feels boring due to lack of spin. So need to improve that otherwise its good.', ""Can't stay connected..have 117mps and it's super fast..my phone is fairly new..it was goes No Internet connection...Also when I would fill the water globe..it will pop up..no internet connection and I lose the chances to win spins..not happy . Emailed tells me to email someone else..smh I spent lot of money and get nothing but spins disappearing and double charged on my Verizon acct when app has issues."", 'Game is very good but there is some problem.... I can play 100mbps internet connection on these game but in game showing that no internet connection...? I can watch YouTube and as well as playing others game on that internet but pirate king are giving some issue....? Please solve this issue..', ""So i get the fact that i love this game so much but i found a glich. The glich happens when you go to bomb strike and when you get the shield at the same time once you've done that exit out of bomb strike and a shield is on the middle of the wheel andnyou cant spin or swipe so youre gonna have to restart. (Fix that bug plz)"", ""I hate that it takes forever for your spins to replenish I get 12 spins every hr my spins are at 120 that's 10 hours I have to wait to get full spins & play. Also you have bet high just to get anything good so since I'm only at 120 I bet 40 spins to win good amount of money I only get to spin 3 times which is no fun & to build your island you need money the higher your level the more it cost to upgrade your island & if you're not a pay to play your stuck waiting forever to get to the next island"", ""I did give it five stars but for some reason the new deep sea spins has been made lot harder to obtain , before it was fine and I was able to get to 100 percent but now it's been changed to make it harder to get the 100 even with 120 spins the time runs out before you get anywhere near 100."", ""I was on the last part of one of your Maps I needed to finish it to get 1600 spins But I was just on it though apparently. I am on a new map but didn't get anything. For finishing the last map This game is a completing order joke. For how long I have played it. It has never happened before on it For the people that own this game. They can go on and check it themselves. They need to sort it out. for I would not recommend it to anyone to use this game"", ""I do love this, but it always gives you what you don't want on purpose!!!! I don't have the money to spend on buying extras, so will delete this game again and will not reinstall, had enough!!!!!"", ""I love playing this game. I try to play it every day if I can. But I've had problems with every update i lose something either bombs or spins. It kinda annoying since I do drop a couple bucks on the game."", ""I love the game, but just yesterday I made a purchase and never received what I paid for. Now it seems as though I've been getting the run around. Still haven't had a helpful response to the matter! 🙄"", ""The item roulette is not random at all. I managed to score 500k but the roulette spinned a little more after having stopped. After using all my bombs, the roulette always stopped at bombs until it was full again. Dear devs, don't fool players like that. Shame on you!"", ""Love the game but fixing to delete never get the hard to get cards even in the big chest in the bomb games and the cost of coins for islands is crazy finally finished a island and now faced with over 100 million coins up to 243 million for the last item on the island and the amount of bombs it is taking to take out a ship or building my god lat night counted 25 strikes to take out a medium ship not a large but a medium also don't like how when your shields are full you don't get your spins ba"", 'I really like this game but i have two opinion. It is very hard to get good spins for example. Attack and 500k, also steal. And i wish there was a other way to get more spins. Instant of playing the bomb game. And not waiting for a day. And ya o`w´o Bye!', ""I love to play Pirate KIngs, but I have addressed the issue concerning my Deep Sweep challenge and nothing has been done about it.

Be smitten with your pond this Feburary when you swim under the Love Mood Stone and Heart Petals effect!","[""Idk why, but I've been craving games like this. And by far, this is the best one yet! I love how simple it is, and your never bored with this game! It's so calming and the color schemes are perfect. No glitches, and everything runs just fine! I would reccomend to anyone who is stressed out or needs a soothing game like this, or even anyone who is interested in a fun and simple game! 💯"", ""It's a cute, pretty little game. Reminds me a lot of the cell stage in Spore where you have to eat other creatures to grow. I like collecting creatures, especially when they come in tons of colors, etc. I just wish there was more to do with the dragons besides making the constellations which takes around 30 seconds at most. I was really looking forward to playing as a dragon and maybe doing a whole new set of levels with them. It's a nice concept, but it's a little lacking in that respect."", ""This game is wonderful. The graphics are great! The only hard thing to do is catching the prey. I like the ascension scene. It was beautiful. The gameplay is easy and I would like to play more. My new goal is to complete this game because it's beautiful and lovely. It's calm and doesn't rush you like most games. I hope you keep working on it. It's wonderful. ( i like this game alot ) I'm 10 by the way."", '5/17/19like this game but does get boring after awhile. you capture the same fish over and over again with every koi. the tank styles never change. and with the dragon koi i find pointless. would be nice to be able to capture different fish maybe even bigger ones with them instead of some sort of orb. overall the game just needs more to it.2/7/20 all these updates yet nothing is different. Also the last two fish we were said to get never received.', ""I've been addicted since the start. It used to be my favorite game when I was little. The koi fish are beautiful, the graphics are amazing, I even made a human version out of that red angel fish prey."", 'Awsome game,really relaxing and a great time consumer, yet it makes it to where you can leave whenever you want! I would rate higher if I could.', ""This has the best artwork I've ever seen,also I give ghis game 5 stars because its relaxing and I like that it is based on a legend that tells you about a koi fish that get over a river and transforms in a dragon."", 'This is a brilliant, fun and relaxing collecting game. I love it. The only improvement I would give us the sound effects, I think they could be calmer, same with the music.', 'Its really fun to play but once your koi turns into a dragon you wont be able to play the dragon anymore so its kinda bad so please in the future please make the dragon playable!!', ""It's very relaxing, it's the kind of game you would play for an hour and it would feel like 15 minutes. The art is beautiful, the fact that you can keep leveling up and exploring new areas and finding new creatues makes the game very interesting. It's easy to get obsessed! The cherry on top is the fact that theres no adds. You can watch them for rewards, but they don't disrupt the gameplay! I downloaded this today and an hour later, its one of my favorite games!"", ""I played the first one and had a great time, but I can't seem to get this one to even open for me. It just keeps on the first loading screen with an occasional pop-up that says something along the lines of 'it's taking longer than normal to download some files'. Really frustrating when it sits there for an hour without any progression of it downloading the said 'files"", ""This game is amazing !!! It is the best! 5 stars is worth it! Through out the time I've been playing it haven't played one add!!!"", ""Very good, fun game, but at the same time, a bit random. 5 stars. It's perfect for any age. 👌"", ""I love this game! The patterns, the prey, it's all awesome. If I could give a few friendly suggestions, perhaps allowing your own koi to breed between themselves? Still limited by egg spaces and timers of course. Also, I'm not really sure what the dragon game is for. I was fine without it, so I dont play that part very often. Excellent peaceful time-wasting game! :)"", ""Fun when it works. I've been playing this for a couple years along with the original. Every few months it gets stuck on the loading screen. I get tired of it not working and uninstall it. I have reinstalled it many times but it still happens. As this seems to be a common problem with many players this should be fixed but it seems to be ignored."", ""I love this game, but it's controls are a little hard to use. Still a good game. I approve."", 'I love it. Kois are my favorite fish. Such beautiful graphics and so colorful. I also love the fact that the kois turn into dragons. I would give this 10 stars if i could. ❤', 'love the game just wish you could use the dragons like one of the koi 5 out of 5', ""I love it you can make fish eggs and is so fun you should try it but you don't have to"", 'Very aesthetically pleasing game, simple, fun and easy to pass a good amount of time with.', 'Very relaxing and enjoyable. I much like the artwork side although i feel like more could be done with gameplay - such as building ones own pond could have more buys without having to use money.', 'The controls isnt bad but still its like butter on a hot pan at tlited😥', ""It won't load and I waited for hours and still didn't load"", ""I can't seem to get past the loading screen so 1 star for now. Please fix. I loved the first game btw"", 'The error in loading contents make the game unable to load', 'This game is a great time consumer and really relaxing', 'Very realaxing, i thorouly enjoybthe gameplay, but it rather hard to level up to the dragon stage.', ""It's such a gorgeous game about fish but I wish the levels could be faster and the could be more males to breed"", ""It's a amazing game but the thing is one and two the only difference is the graphics other than that the are both great games"", 'I love this game. Very relaxing for me and fun for my 2.5 year old.', 'Very mellow game I luv it so relaxing tooget sit in hangout with my fish ...', ""It's so much fun to find all your prey, and evolve it into a dragon! And find all different dragons!"", 'Beautiful game, just love it The kois are beautiful and there dragon transformations are cool too', 'bad experience still in the loading page , i belive there is a malfunction hoop u solved fast', 'Super fun! art could be more refined elegant rather than cartoony furry', 'A much improved version of the already great original. I really enjoyed the new features.', 'This is game is peaceful it relaxes you completely but at the same time it keeps you playing cuz its so addictive.

Happy farming!","[""Love the game. Its frozen up on me right now and really hope it gets fixed soon and while your at it maybe reconsider some of your package deals cause they are not really that good of a deal, maybe the ones that are 300% match are more realistically affordable. It's a game not a requirement so people are less apt to spend the money when trying to live."", ""This game was really fun at first, but after getting my level to about mid to late teens, the game completely stalled out, and only really playable once or twice a day. Gameplay is fun, but the time spent waiting on things is poorly balanced to the point it's almost pay-to-win."", ""I enjoy the game. Like some others on it, it is a welcomed distraction from pain and other things. I like the different challenges. I do wish it would award more mallets, if you don't have real $ to drop you nearly hit a stand still. If I stop playing that would be why, so that I don't spend $."", ""Well made and designed time suck. Relies heavily on you spending your time waiting for stuff to happen. Can skip waiting for $$$ but otherwise, expect to spend hours of your life to advance anything. Graphics, music, sound effects, programming are all top notch, but I don't like investing so much time on something that makes zero positive impact on my real life. This game has nothing to offer but wasted time."", ""Advertised as a casual farmer, but allows freedom in building; strategy isn't explained well enough so it's easy to build what isnt needed, creating bottle necks, and digging yourself in a hole: where it feels only paying real money will get you out. It's not obvious what buildings are available to interact with, level locked or available, they look the same until pressing it; unless there's a sale relating to that, then you have icons all over the screen; but not for free league rewards."", 'id give more stars if it wasnt so much like all facebook games where everything has timers. Stuff annoying. As a gamer I want a game I can play and get through at my own pace. whether it fast or slow. not hurry up and wait to get stuff done honestly dont know why these games so popular!', ""It's fun, its addicting, theres always something to do. You can meet new people and team up. Love the cooperative projects.. however. I think some of the things on our farm take a long time to wait for things. Time consuming. But altogether fun"", 'Iam a old player of the game since the original big farm. The new feb 10 update is nice the ui feels snappier and easy to use than before. Can please bring some of the changes from original bigfarm in online game like the co-opirative tree ,gorse ranch etc,and the farm management is better in the original bigfarm . The ui of co-opirative is very hard tobuse and it very buggy most of the time. Please bring the co-opirative tree.', ""OMG DO NOT DOWNLOAD I've been playing the game for about 8month and was uptown level 60s when today it kept crashing. It was the only app on my phone with any problems but it was messing my phone up so tried to switch phone off and back on for my phone to say files on it had been corrupted and phone will have to be restored by to factory settings.. I have lost everything all my holiday photos, I.importa texts calls and the 2 other games I had on the phone and had been playing for nearly a year"", ""Typically this is a great game...one of my favorites. However I am now on a facebook ban from commenting, posting, and MESSENGER for 24 hours. JUST FROM TRYING TO INVITE SOMEONE. Are you fricken serious. Normally not my biggest worry in life but where we live, messenger is the only way to communicate with my boyfriend and kids dad while he is at work. So now I'm just irritated."", ""It's fun to grow a farm with friends. There's some issues though. Things cost too much and take too grow or built. You can't build more than one thing at a time and there's not enough free rewards. It's also hard to get up in levels."", 'I love this game and the friends I have made though it. However there are times it is difficult to load or just closes for no reason. Otherwise I would rate it 5* plus', 'Claims to have support for the game! Bahaha... You get generic probably computer generated replies. Glitches and upgrades up the wazoo! The only thing they have figured out with out a problem is how to take your money!', 'Lots.of.fun.....passes time quickly!!! Keep up the good work and your farm will be awesome!!!! Just wish it was easier to upgrade your.workers and expand your farm, I ran outta room the 1st day!', ""Very enjoyable. Lot's of things to do all the time just like real farming. Activities simulate real farming chores. Lot of fun!"", 'Fun game but there needs to be a way to report people for harrassment. I had a co-op kick me out and make fun of me for mental health issues.', 'Turns out it is more fun than I thought. There are a couple of things you will have to figure out by yourself on how to play. Maybe it just me cause I never played games like this one. I really enjoy it.', ""Fun game. Glitches up sometimes when loading, but fixed by reinstalling and you don't lose your goods. Frequently offered in-app purchases."", ""Would be better if things didn't take so long ex. Cows. Also if there was a way to get coins since you really need them and alot of them."", 'Like the game sad that you cant build more than one thing at a time that makes the game super slow to me 5 or more hours at a time to build each thing or upgrade I should say is crazy', 'It\'s a fun game for sure, but it\'s too glitchy. Whenever I try to open it, I get a ""bad internet connection"" alert, even though my other apps work fine and my wifi connection is perfect. When the game finally does load, it doesn\'t work. I\'ll harvest a field or an animal pen, and try to feed the animals but the sleep symbol above the pen doesn\'t go away. I shut the game off and restart my phone, open the game again and no harvesting at all has been done. Cue the same repeat process.', ""This game in unplayable. Constant server issues, game going slow, not acknowledging I sent an order or harvesting something. Errors popping up frequently. It's not my connection as it's happening to my co op too. This has been happening the entire time I've played the game and it is getting worse and more frequent. For an online game that has a competitive edge to it, they sure make it hard to actually play the game."", ""Don't bother. A basic game with limited graphics that regularly has server issues. The minimum purchase is 4.99 for very little. It is down again as I write this ! The harvesting is one tap per field, no swiping. There is no depth to the game play, you just grow and sell. No combining of harvested goods into more expensive items. The graphics are from 10 years ago. The only good part is the chat and coop working towards group goals."", 'My videos in market, doghouse, or balloon have not worked since the last update! Could not switch out contracts for personal tournament, not the saplings for tree nursery, and now for bee contest! Very inconvenient and frustrating to always have to find a way to complete around the bugs in your system! Cannot get inside the bee tournament! Am so sick of this! It is always something! I do not work for you for crying out loud, just trying to play!', ""The game didn't update for me so it wouldn't open, I got a message to uninstall and re install if it wouldn't update and now it has started me back at the beginning with all my progress gone 😡\U0001f92c"", ""I love this game. Although I believe the creators should make it easier to get supplies other than real money( I know you have to make money as well) but it shouldn't be so time consuming all the time for people who wanna build their farms in a timely manner. I spend real money an it's still difficult to upgrade an expand an stay in the positive with happy. Jus a lil advise. Love the game though."", ""I do NOT recommend this game to anyone that wants to have fun. Stop wasting your money here! They want you addicted at first then bam, money is needed, It takes hours and hours to upgrade anything! And because it takes so long for upgrades or 6-10 hours for stuff to grow, you're going to be held up playing it. Pay to play, money hungry game, everything you do takes so much time and money. Why is it not possible to play for free? Stupid! Support is a joke! Your better off spending somewhere else!"", ""Been playing for a few years, all of a sudden today all my money is gone!! Hmmmm probably just going to delete it apparently it's a complete waste of time!!"", 'My problem with being able to load the game is fixed. However, nearly everytime I am playing the game I get ""bad internet connection"" and its super glitchy. I have fiber internet, I have full bars of 4G. Its not my end. The only thing that makes this game enjoyable is the co op. I enjoy working with others towards goals because its not a fun game to play alone. Also to the developers who responded to me in German. I don\'t speak German, so I have no idea what you said.', 'I think the wheat and cows and cherries are a little too long till you can harvest them. I also think pumpkins,rice, and horses should be introduced. Also sometimes after updates the game tends to have issues with glitches or bad connection, definitely something should be looked into to fix that issue so it doesnt happen every time.', ""I liked the game itself, but bombarding players with lots of offers in order for them to gain and improve more, is making the game looking like thirsty for real money. And besides, adding some features like log in rewards won't hurt you so much right? Some other games have this but believe it or not it adds a bit of excitement playing the game. And why does the selling of the products thru the barn offers like 2x or 3x less of its price when being bought?"", 'Play until the money runs out and then run lol it becomes so hard, the only option is to buy gold so its over for me at level 13', 'Good game, maybe not enough info in the game itself delegating what each icon or symbol means. Which only kind of forces you to join a team to learn the subtleties of the game. But groups and the people inside groups have there own priorities and biases so it\'s hard to know the ""right"" way to play. But I digress', 'A good game but unfair when grouping co-ops in challenges. The put 75+ l levels against levels of 9 and 12.', ""They dont put you with same level players that you are, co-op tournaments or your player league events, you might be level 20 then they put you or your co-op up against levels way higher than you and that's not fair to you or your co-op. Makes the game no fun losing all the time, we should be grouped with same leveled players and co-ops for events. During co-op tournaments, the game server/connectivity goes down or they decide to do an upgrade.You cant compete in tournaments when this happens."", 'I enjoy playing. I like the idea of having my farm and a farm co-OP to be part of. I am not a fan of the other farms the game wants us to build. However occassionally it says bad connection then like counts down from 7 seconds to 0 & picks up right where it cut out. Overall though I play everyday at least a little simply cuz I find it helps in winding from my real day.', ""I only dropped this down to one star because it has refused to open for me all day. When i tried to play it this morning, it told me to update. But it wouldn't let me update OR play the game. So i uninstalled, then reinstalled, hoping it would install with the update. But ever since i did that, the game won't open for me. PLEASE FIX THIS!!! I love the game, but i can't play it at all. And I'm in a co-op that I really like, but will boot me if i don't play for 24 hours without telling them."", ""Fun farming game. At this point (level 9) there's not a whole lot of waiting for tasks. They are very generous with their gold. If I had any suggestions, I guess to be able to watch ads to speed up production or to watch ads for gold. I found this through Mistplay and I thought I would try it. I get great rewards for playing really fun games!"", ""It's a extremely slow progressing game. Add more seasonal events, allow multiple constructions instead of one at a time and give more goals that don't involve buying coins. It was literally playable for one day and now it's non progressive and boring. Take a gander at Farmville 2 and get ideas. At least that's a playable game."", ""Changing my review... I love this game but these short solo and coop weeks are tiresome. There's not enough time between the coop challenges any more. Short coop challenges are too demanding and people are leaving the game because of it. I was hoping that this was simply a holidays change but now I'm not so sure. Please go back to full solo and coop weeks so we can get back to enjoying the game.""]"

Let Us Adore You and download the update now to experience the True Kinda Love!","[""Pretty boring to be honest. 99% of the game you'll spend afk while you wait for the cats to come back with items. Not much to do in the game at all while you are waiting and the minigames are tedious and boring. It's a cute and harmless game but it's just not fun to play at all. I do not recommend this if you want something to relieve your boredom."", 'I love the game. Just wish the gems are a bit easier to get rather than one a day. Maybe a task to earn them. Still i love the kitties but it could do with a few more activities in each world', 'I love this game. the cats have good animation and expressions, the moments also have great expressions it gives so much life in the game and alot of references from the shows itself. I really appreciate the work put into this game.', 'Some probles didn\'t change, in fact, if the Steven Universe movie is really about changing then this update makes no sense at all, again, looks like someone that love you has bad news, it is an advertising update, where nothing changed at all, loved the game, but it\'s sad that my true kinda of love is now broken, when I have seen the app update description, I thought: ""yeahhhhh"", now seing old comments about these ""ads"" update, I just: *No*, it\'s not posible!, still, loving the game tho :3♡', 'really cute graphics, daily prizes to keep you coming back, low stress, and interaction with nostalgic cartoon network characters. I really like it!', 'This game is so much fun!! It has five different show references that include powerpuff girls, amazing world of gumball, steven universe and adventure time. You can enter all the characters main houses and when you take your cat out, the characters have a little description of whatever it brings back!! Incredible game and recommended to all others!!', ""It's literally a mix of my two favorite things. Cats and cartoon Network how could I not get the game? It's a great game. I put 4 stars because I believe that there is no such thing as perfect and that there is always room for improvement. But hyperbeard is my favorite game creators right now and then you made this. It's a masterpiece from the artwork, gameplay and funny references to the different shows and stuff. Please get this game and support these lovily creators, it's worth it I promise."", ""Love this game, it's a cute and quick distraction during my day. My only issue is that items I find in the Barn area sometimes won't display, i.e. Greg's guitar. Sometimes the items will show up, but most of the time they don't display. That's my only complaint and issue so far! Hope it gets fixed soon! I'm playing on a Samsung running Android version 9."", ""It's a good collectathon, but it gets boring, so it's good to have another game to play while waiting"", 'Please make more mini games for each realm. The mini games right now are slow and boring, makes coin collecting tedious.', ""Cutesy AFK fun themed to popular cartoons! This game is good for any fans of recent Cartoon Network cartoons, whenever you're old or young the worlds have many entertaining references that'll catch your eye. Each world will keep you busy for a while, after that it's easy to get enough gems to buy another one. One issue though is no cloud saving yet, you have to go through the files themselves to copy them to a new phone. Can't wait for further updates on this game, the new update looks great!"", ""This is a fun, original game. You never know what the cats will come back with. It takes place in several CN Worlds (Steven Universe, Adventure Time, We Bare Bears, etc.). I'd recommend it for someone wanting a different gaming experience."", ""It's pretty fun to play the first couple of days and it's amusing to see all the cats, clothes and stuff the characters are doing in the background. It looks really neat, but I'd love to see more mini-games, given that maybe you get bored of flowering watermelons at the beginning. All in all, great game, I love it!"", ""I love this!the game is so CUTE!i started playing yesterday and i was so impressed. The animation is so smooth and you can actually see what cat is going out! I have one question though...Can you make a kelptofox game? Me and my brother want to see that game! Your games are amazing! Or can you make kelptodragons and if you do THANK YOU! So I'm leaving a five star rating! Thanks for making all of your games!"", ""it's a really cute game, but i wish you could do more stuff with the cats. they also take really long to come back, and i would also like more mini-games rather than just watering flowers."", ""I love this game.. really fun with cartoon Network characters❤️❤️❤️. But i couldn't find how to save progress.. I can't play in multiple phones..😭😭 . Please make progress save"", ""Overalls this game is fun and addictive, the art style is adorable and I love all the references from the show. My one critic is that there are only a few worlds, I know it will take a while to fill all the rooms but what I do what's going to happen after that? 10/10 love this game!"", 'Ahhhh I love it I love everything about it but I kinda wish that you could get gems easier', ""The update notes do not reflect the current state of the game. Upon seeing that I had not received the advertised barn update in-game in over 10 days, I made the fatal mistake of uninstalling and reinstalling the app thinking that I had missed an update. DO NOT DO THIS! I have flushed literal days of progress, two worlds entirely, and three worlds' worth of cats away over something that still does not exist in my game. I am considering uninstalling for good due to the lack of data recovery."", ""I love the interaction it gives to the different shows for the fans but I'd like to suggest more mini-games that allow us to spend more time on the app. Perhaps mini-games that allow the user to bond more with our cats"", 'Unfortunately I was only able to give this a 3-star rating since I never got the new update, besides that this game is incredibly adorable and I play it constantly every day. I definitely recommend this to all my friends who enjoy watching all the shows.', ""Steven Universe's in there and I like Steven Universe and Steven Universe future. So I gave this a 5 out of 5 rating. It's so good. I like the cat because it features. Customization : )"", 'I like the game but it takes to long TO Get another iteme thats y and also becaus the mini games arent fun to play', ""It's pretty good but when your buying clothing for your cat why does most things cost gems? Like seriously and even when you buy a 🐈 they just give you a random 1️⃣ why can't you choose your own?! Overall, the game is ok."", 'Experience is great i play this everyday and i love it. Buut i wish that there was more of cartoon places to visit cause im almost finished and i want to play and collect more. Its very creative👍👌🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟', ""I love it. It is really fun but it's laggy if it was not laggy I would love it! So 4 stars ★★★★☆"", 'Help, I have updated the app but its new features are not there like the Steven Universe Future update. Please fix this and I will rate appropiately next time.', ""I'm sorry this game is boring af. The graphics are cute but the games play? You wait. You pet the cat. You wait some more. You get a thing that is placed in the room. You feed the cat. You wait. The mini games suck. This game sucks."", ""Great game to be honest the graphics are amazing but if aome suggestions could be added i would probably make the worlds free insread of paying for it but if you are'nt comfortable with that can you at least let the mini games free?"", 'I kinda love this game. After a while it gets boring. But it is fun, its like a waiting game were you send your stuff to get other stuff and wait. It might be fun for other people tho.', 'Sound starts bugging when you get into a discord call which is weirdly specific but its like the sound crashed and it makes a high pitched sometime low pitched drill sound. Otherwise the game is pretty solid!', ""I love steven universe and it reminds you of season 1 and 2 and so on,and the barn is amazing you have to get it and there's adventure time and power puff girls and more please get it you won't regret it"", ""It's adorable. And maybe you could add some items from the Steven Universe movie."", 'The most relaxing games,but i wish you guys can add more minigames thats all I will give 5 if you do that', 'I love this game! It is so cute and only gives ads when you click on it. Definitely a must for any cat or kleptocats lovers.', ""I really like this game, but today my 2 gems just disappeared after the app icon changed, I'm not sure what happened. Also I wish that the coin amount increased on the games."", 'The main reason why I love this game first of all because I loved the game kleptocats first of all second of all I really like Cartoon Network and third of all I just love it!!!!', ""It is a good game but to collect gems is hard and takes forever unless you buy gems and it's like WHAT?!!?!!?!!"", 'It is such a wonderful game!! I love collecting all the cats and items. Also at the fact that its all my favorite Cartoon Network games! 5/5 stars!', ""This game is so fun! I have kleptocats and kleptocats 2, but they're nothing compared to this! I really reccomend this game.""]"

Join the discussion at https://discord.gg/monstronauts.","[""It's fun game and the support team is amazing. I have played potion punch 2 for a number of months and I always find it fun to play and makes me want to play more. However recently I've upgraded to a new phone and I thought I lost my progress but the support team were quick to help and managed to transfer my data from my last device over, they were very kind and did everything to help. I would totally recommend this game to anyone a fun game to play or even something to do in your down time."", ""I've played the first potion punch, and this one is better imo. Great gameplay and variations. I encountered bugs, sometimes my mana don't get refilled while offline. Also once, i got mana from level rewards, but my mana turned zero instead of adding it. Loading each levels takes too long imo, but maybe its just my slow phone causing it. Overall still good."", ""Everything about the game is great! I have also spent some money on skins and stuff... I hate that sometimes since valentine update - the game doesn't collect offline Mana! Even I open up the game after 3-4 hrs the Mana is zero.. and the free ads won't open too! The ads help sometime to host parties and gain extra Mana. I wish this problems would be fixed soon!"", ""It's good but when I got to level 30 it won't bring out any more patrons. I've been waiting for 30 minutes but no one arrived I've restarted and it just consumed all the flame thingy I have and it does the same thing. Please fix this."", ""I liked this game since then but when you guys did a change on the 1st World (Peakwood Potion) on the design and color of the potions. Before it's kinda easy to recognize the colors but now you added lines and dots onto it and it makes the game horrible and hurtful to the eyes of the gamers/players! Just bring it back like before!"", ""Love the game. It has a very distinct style and everything looks so well done. Ads are so minimal I don't remember how often I see them. The controls are easy to understand and the gameplay is simple, but the levels still give you a challenge. I've never felt like I got to a point where I was completely stuck or that I'd have to buy gems if I wanted to progress anytime soon. There's always new content being released so there's no running out of stuff to do. Would definitely recommend."", 'This game is a lot of fun. Yes there is a premium currency and ads but the game has not paywalled any features. My five year old has been playing with me and now she is learning how to mix colors. I really enjoy the game loop and laughed so hard when I realized the stars had little butts. Keep up the great work devs!', ""Having levels with goals feels contrived and arbitrary. I like the original potion punch's day system better, it was like running a real shop. I liked the old patron system better too. I'll miss the workers and skins here, but I've gotta stick with the original potion punch."", ""Really fun, mildly addictive. My only complaint is that sometimes the game seems to go touch blind. I grab a potion and drag, and it either won't move at all or only move when I dream it in the opposite direction of a customer."", ""I really like this game, its challenging which I like. And it's not repetitive, which alot of games are but this one isent. It has new challenges with each chapter. I'm all caught up so I'm hoping for more levels soon."", 'This has become one of my favourite mobile games. I love that you can play it without being forced to spend real money, which seems to be really rare these days! Crazy addicting, with great levels and events', ""Very fun but challenging. I wish there was more transparency on how to get 3 star ratings because I know what I have to do but I don't know how to do it. If there was more strategic guidance I would like that. Great game."", 'I like this game, its different and fun, its easy to get coins too and they dont force you to spend money to get things done. You can really sit back and let a few hours go playing this game', 'I really enjoyed playing this game. But can you please lessen the waiting time? Thank you! again, Please work on your loading bar. Thanks :)', 'The game is great, but loading times are terrible for a 2D game, there are thousands of unnecessary animations. Even if you restart a level, it wipes all the allocated memory and starts loading the entire level from zero. Poor memory management here.', 'One of the biggest reasons im rating it 5 stars, is the color blind setting. There are usually never any. And it is so nice to see it somewhere for once.', 'Very Addictive game... but i am having Problem With Ads..i want to earn through Ads.but It doesn’t show and Its need permission to access my file though i have already granted.', 'I loved the first one and this one I just wish it was a little easier to get gems. How do you earn more gems, I can not get any more upgrades without them. I will not pay real money for them as a game should not be a money pit.', 'This game was very interesting and easy to play It was not like other cooking games I love this game very much!!!!!!!!!!!!!', 'Potion Punch 2 is a magically fun time! The graphics are smooth and the upgrades help make it a bit more emersive. I would recommend Potion Punch 2 to any fans of Potion Punch, fantasy, cooking, and fun!', 'Good and improved. I started on the 1st one and this one makes its easier to get patrons and skips the mixing cup which is convenient, fast paced and fun. Also good graphics', ""Very fun! Optional ads and q fair currency system that is not money grubbing. Never gets old and is one of my favorite apps. Can't wait for more levels!"", 'I enjoy the game alot but it would be even better if it had the option to play it on pc and use a mouse to control the game because having to move my thumbs quickly while trying to hold the phone can really hurt my wrists.', ""Time management at its best. Real challenge but not unfair. Kinda poopy you can just buy everything if you're lazy, and the load screen times are a bit much."", 'Incredibly challenging on higher levels and super addictive. You dont need to spend real money. But it would make things easier', 'Love the game. Except that i always got stuck at the loading screen at 50% and i had to restart the game.', 'Cute addictive engaging game. Sorry but in my opinion 2 is so much better than 1 with the exception of the fact more shops need to be opened.', 'Fantastic time killer, fantasy pub tycoon, and suspenseful leveler. I recommend this game to anyone who likes any of the above mentioned.', 'Super fun. Really want some more levels. Can be a little glitchy and freezes sometimes but not bad other than that.', 'Interesting time management game with cool mechanics. I really enjoy the game.', ""I recently started playing this game and I love it! The design/graphics are fun, it's challenging but not overly complicated and it doesn't feel repetitive. I like that there are things to work towards such as upgrading your shop and leveling up customers as well as the quests. Also, I'm enjoying not having ads but can chose to watch if I need more coins. I can definitely see myself playing this for awhile. Thank you for making a great game!"", ""Potion Punch 2 is a super fun game! I played the original Potion Punch a year ago, and even though I enjoyed it, it got pretty stale. PP2 has been super versatile and has had a pretty cute story so far, which also adds to the game's appeal. The only downside I would mention is that if I play it for an extended period of time, my phone will get super hot. I would still give it 5 stars though, because with so much going on, I already expected that to happen."", 'Love this game! A good way to pass time. Difficult at certain levels, but not impossible.', ""When trying to link my facebook account i lost all my progress and im stuck on the second level woth no way of getting past the tutorial as its doesn't load up."", 'Love it so far. Minda wish I could want more cosmetics through gameplay. Just need more but not for real money to much.', ""With the new update, the close button on the 2x boost pop up is broken and unresponsive. You can't close it with out starting a game or restarting the entire app"", ""Much more hectic than the first one. It's impressive that they've been able to balance the gameplay so we'll, even though each stage poses a different, progressing challenge. Cannot wait for more levels to be released because they all seem to have their own unique character. So far, all three levels are top-notch. Kind of hard to get tired of playing this when it switches things up while you progress. Really really loving this game. Great job Monstronauts!"", ""This game is extremely fun and engaging without overly restrictive paywalls for progress and no level difficulty based paywalls where its impossible to win without paying for extras. That's 100% respectable. That said, this game still has issues with freezing during loading screens, right at 50%, especially when you beat a particularly difficult level, freeze at the loading screen, restart, and then lose your progress. That's extremely frustrating and hasn't been fixed as of January 2020"", 'I like games that require my speedy move, and this is one of them. But, some glitches that happen in Endless mode are distracting my experience. In Eversand EL, sometimes there are no more coming patrons uddenly, which makes me throw away an item to end the game when I want to keep playing. In Shroudland EL, upon defeating some Evil Eyes they fold their wings and become invincible while they still attack patrons. This must be fixed asap.', ""Hey! I just noticed something up with the colorblind mode: The red potion is represented by horizontal lines, the blue one by polka dots and the yellow by vertical lines. But when a patron asks for the red potion (I'm not colorblind, just wanted to see how it looked like), the order comes with vertical lines! The same happens when someone order the yellow potion (which is represented by vertical lines), the order shows horizontal lines! It's inverted!""]"

I keep picking the free ones and playing more levels until I have more coins, then I change the decorations/furniture and get the ones I actually want.

My my 1 star will stay until the music does not turn on by itself after I've touched the green hexagon standard shaped settings button to turn off the sounds. I've only been playing the game for a few days I really liked the game until today, when I discovered that the game has the ability to turn the sound back on after it has been turned off.

I've downloaded similar games this one is the best. The graphics are good and it seems like it's going to be an interesting storyline. I like that it's not your usual 3 Match Game. Also, you have four choices when decorating instead of the usual three. I highly recommend!"", ""I'm adjusting my rating due to how fast the developers responded and fixed my problems.

After playing a bit longer, coins were easier to get. I do appreciate the great response from the developer. Thank you for all your help. My rating has been updated.', ""Game is the worst.

• Bug fixes and improvements","[""Game has GREAT potential. But crashes so often like what the hell? After watching an ad to earn double tickets for 5 mins, the game crashes and won't load after a hundred tries. If I want to earn double tickets, I'd have to watch the ad again. I can't believe I'm saying this but I actually paid real money for items. And the items didn't even show up in my closet!! Your customer service said there's just a delay but it's been weeks now and still no items. So I guess that's it they just don't care"", ""I've played Covet since summer 2016. The graphics are great and customer svc. has been 5-star for me. However, the daily challenge used to be for any level player without favoring higher levels. Having to spend over $1000 to earn $200 and over $700 to earn $100 isn't worth it. Challenges used to welcome variety and creativity but now they're all supposed to have the same outfits. WHY??? And Covet has gotten greedy!!! For me, it's no longer worth the time and energy. It's no longer fun!!!"", ""They bring in millions of $, but they can't control the numerous glitches and hang ups with this game. Players lose real money from those glitches and if their customer service even responds, it's months later and compensation is a joke...or they'll blame it on your phone or service. Don't waste your time or money on this game. I quit."", ""I love playing this game! Being able to create a style to fit a theme is one of my favorite pastimes (I wish I was able to own some of the outgits I've made in this.) However, it's hard to manage your in-game money. The challenges don't give you enough cash as a reward to be able to buy clothing you need yo enter other challenges. Diamonds cost real-life money - and too much of it, at that! This game would be so much more fun without this limiting restriction."", ""I used to love this game, but the longer I past it, the more I don't. I've been paint for at least three years, and I'm only on level 17. THREE years. It takes forevvver to level up unless you spend real money. Which they try to get you to do every chance they get with props and head pieces. And without those, you have a very poor chance at getting good ratings. And they're crazy expensive. It also crashes. A lot. I just did the update today, and now it won't even load."", ""Glitchy. I havent been able to even load the game the last 2 days. Sometimes I cant do certain things like judge the outfits because it glitches out or stalls. It's frustrating when your working on a certain goal and cant achieve it because you cant even load the game for periods at a time. When not glitchy I love this game."", ""i love the fashion. taking the pic outfit they show and getting inspired to create something of your own. of course, to get a good score you either have to come up with something brilliant and gorgeous or you have to follow the leader. sometimes the options aren't all that great. the down side is the price to buy the good stuff has to come from your pocket to really be able to compete for a good score and some of the prices are just so outlandish."", ""Better if the prize were closer to the amount needed to spend per challenges. For example, some require you to buy garments or accessories that costs from 100 - 10000 cash or diamond. Once you sent 600+ your reward to enter is only 100 or 200, and you can only get more if you're score is 5 stars +. Once in awhile you get 500 but still not enough to enter in a lot of challenges to get higher prizes. But still a fun game to pass time."", ""For the first time ever I've encountered with such an awesome dressing game but why whyy is this game all about money! Once you're out of the cash and diamonds provided by default you're done! You can not access other outfits, fill the requirements or complete the other challenges.. Not even ad videos are available like other games provide if you don't want to invest money. Cuz seriously investing 100 bucks for mere diamonds for playing is good for nothing. I'm liking it as well as dissappointed"", ""This game is frustrating. You HAVE to put real money into the game to do anything... which is a scam... because once you buy an item then use it... you have to pay to use the item more than once... that is ridiculous. I have never seen a game so money driven in awhile, and I'm uninstalling the game now. Readers be warned... it is a fun game, but you have to drop sooooo much money to do anything. Money does not grow on trees... at least give more benefits when purchasing."", ""I like the game itself but it is very money driven. It's almost impossible to move forward without spending real money. Also, my team has been robbed of rally prizes over and over again. No compensation from developers, no attempt to fix the issue. I wish they would just listen to their fan base. It could be 5 star game!"", 'Feedback is never listened to. Issues have existed for years and been ignored by the creators. The Runway Rally feature denies prizes that should have been earned. The pressure to spend real currency is enormous, with many challenges requiring a single use novelty item (one silver glove? a handbag shaped like a honeypot? that costs more currency than I can win in three other challenges?). Hair accessories are £9!!! With a bit more balance and serious bug fixing would be a 5 star game.', ""I like the challenges and putting outfits together, however to get anywhere in the game you really need to spend money. The other thing is the game keeps crashing. I haven't been able to download the update or open the game for 11 days now. It is ridiculous! Update: It is now February 8, 2020 and this game still won't load."", ""Earning tickets by voting for looks is way too time consuming. It used to be 3 votes per tickets, but now it's back to 5. This was a horrible decision; it makes me want to skip through designs and not actually look at them. Borrowing items would be WAY easier if you only showed those members that had items applicable to the selected category. Instead, I scroll and check through 50 names only to have none of them own an item in the category I need. It's very frustrating and poorly designed."", ""I love play this games but I was a little disappointed when I played covet fashion because at that time my cellphone was broken and I downloaded it new on my cellphone but I had to start over and I connected to FB but couldn't and yesterday I didn't have time to update and when I updated how surprised I was because I was Get out of the fashion house and look for a new fashion house! what actually happened? explanation please! thank you"", ""It's totally rediculus that you basically have to rebuy the clothes you've already bought because you can only wear them once. And the amount of diamonds you get for your money is way to low. Improve the game by allowing us to use our wardrobe at least 5 times before we have to reset."", ""*Claim your rewards* thing doesn't work at all and I don't think you guys even care to fix it. How are we supposed to enter challenges if we are not getting enough money/diamonds. I like playing this game but if you don't change this you are gonna lose hell lot subscribers as I can see everyone has the same issue. And 10 diamonds for watching long ads? Seriously!!"", ""I absolutely love this game and defenitly suggest it. All the clothes and items are cute and stylish. I love the dresses. But, the only thing I don't like is how glitchy and laggy it is, but that might just be my phone, idk. Anyway, I still highly suggest it and give it a 5 star review."", 'I love this game. I look forward to playing it everyday. Sadly, it is geared toward the players who have higher numbers completed. I play the daily excerise because it cost too much to play more but I do try. It is not an equal opportunity game, it is all about how much money are you willing to spend to advance your number.', ""The game is good, but the reason i gave only 3 stars is because the tickets are not being filled or recovered by time. That's actually really annoying. I've a suggestion that you could fill those in some time and I'm pretty sure everyone would like it.and I'll rate it 5 stars. Still a good work"", ""I love this app except I just bought 600 diamonds and they took the money but I never got the diamonds. Might not keep this app much longer if it's going to take money from me. Well so much for loving the game now it wont open the one time today i got it to open I couldn't do anything on it waist of my time awful game."", ""I seriously love this game. I don't make any in-app purchases, but I love collecting the clothes available. 💜 P.S. - I hope with your next update we can wear jewelry on both hands because I love the props and all but when you have to wear four pieces... it just makes one side of the body look too busy."", ""Amazing! I absolutely love this game. I would go so far to say I'm actually quite addicted. The only reason I didn't give it a full 5 stars is because there is no way you can get through the game without spending your own money. They do have some deals on sometimes, but I do spend quite a lot of money to get through the levels. I wish you could get more for your money as it is only just a game and you don't really get awarded for the money you put in."", ""I hate how the voting works. It's unfair that you are judged with people who are not in the same level as you. They obviously have access to more accessories. It's really unfair and makes absolute no sense. Please change this. Be prepared to spend, if you want to enjoy this game, be prepared to spend money. The more money you spend, the higher your chances of winning or scoring perfect scores and more."", ""It's an addicting game. But I don't like the fact that in order to look your best you have to buy hair and accessories on top of the expensive clothes, shoes, ànd pursues. all in all I like the game, I do the daily challenge every day."", 'At first i liked this game very much. But after the recent update it started to hang a lot, it is impossible to play normally. Buttons are not working properly and shops are not loadib clothes! Please fix this.', ""I have been playing this game for years and love it! Best part, because I have it linked to my Facebook, anytime I switch devices or stop playing for a while, all I have to do is reinstall the game and I'm back in business. I've never spent a dollar on it but I may soon. 💁\u200d♀️"", ""This game is ok. Prices, realism, and creativity allowed is ok. This would probably be a three star game if it weren't for the fact that they don't do their research when it comes to challenges. There is a new challenge (febuary 2020) that tells you to style for an Ancient Egyptian goddess. EGYPTIAN GODS AND GODDESSES ALL HAD ANIMAL HEADS! Look it up! How can they have us do that when the models are all human? There are no animal heads. They disregarded and dissrespected an ancient culture."", ""I have been enjoying this game for a while now but lately the requirements on a lot of the challenges are requiring items that cost diamonds. In order to have enough diamonds you will have to buy them, of course. So there are a lot of challenges I haven't been able to do, which is a bummer."", 'I have been playing this game for a long time and i really like it . But i now i encounter a problem and the thing is everyone from my house who participated in the rally got the the big prize ""pleasnt scarf"" except me i also participated in the rally but i didn\'t get it... I\'ve contacted covet customer service they didn\'t even rply ... So the 1 star is for the customer service...', ""Poor Player Appreciation, they rig overall scores, steal your unworn bonus, customer service doesn't answer back half of the time and they stopped giving players 2000$ game dollars at the start of the season, literally charges for everything and refuses to give long time players a break on prices, takes forever to level up and the beginning hair and makeup levels are horrible and barely scores, then the higher you level up the more the rig scores."", ""If you know how to manage the money you can play this game...example I'm in the 17-level ..😍😍😍😍this game is a love it has some months maybe a year in m phone..it's true that is hard to pass the level ..(when you have no credit cards like me) but i love the game😍😍"", 'I Have been playing this game for a while, I have had a few issues with it in the past with it freezing ect. However now I have installed this app agian, eveything seems good once more and I remember how much I love it.', 'Fun game but almost impossible to play unless you spend real money on it. Has challenges to celebrate diversity yet only has one body type and a very limited range of skin tones. They need to increase the rewards each day for people to stand a chance at making outfits.', ""So it's a very fun dress up game. I am loving playing. But it is one that if you cant spend real money all the time on a game, you can't do much of anything in the beginning. So that's been a hard thing to be pleased with."", 'I have deleted this game which was loads of fun to play each day for over 2 years and the investment of time and money in a fashion house. Why? because of the ad choices for violent video games, especially fish play, which tortures a cute Nemo looking cartoon fish. Because i am not into torturing. I am into fashion.', ""I love this game ,but hear lately it's not giving me my diamonds or rewards . And I thought I might would uninstall it. I'm going to give them time to make everything better and right. Before I go ahead and uninstall it."", ""Fantastic Fashion game! This game is not only fun; it keeps you in the loop of what's in and past fashion that can be recycled again. Fun, entertaining and inspires your own style, can't say enough good things about this game!"", 'The game is enjoyable to play but creative needs to work on being more diverse and put more thought into execution. For a challenge focused on a Black Women being a role model with a dark skin model as the main image but then you click into the challenge and the skin is locked to a light skinned character.', 'I love thi app...but I wish when I had an idea for an outfit I could buy the pieces.. I wont spend real cash so I get behind. I do like how once you buy it you keep it...not use for a certain count and have to buy again!']"

I play it almost every day and I get sucked into so much joy. This game has so many fantastic game features. There is over 80 costumes to collect and each one has their own special ability.

Fantastic work Gameloft and all the game creators, and thank heavens for making this game"", ""Prefer the old version. And I believe many people agree with me. Playing easy tasks that only last 30 seconds that aren't very challenging. liked it when you would complete the whole section and level up to a different type of theme in the game. It should have been a separate game meaning it should have been minion Rush two not just updating it so 2-year olds can only play it."", ""I couldn't even PLAY the game, when i clicked on the start thingie it said something about,“ CONNECT TO GAMELOFT SERVERS” I waited for litterally 45 minutes and NOTHING!"", ""I love minion rush. So fun. Really gets your blood pumping. Not to many ads and if one sneaks in, it's a good break from all of the intense gameplay before. I love the upgrades that come with each minion and how you can compete online, and in different locations. The boss levels are rather thrilling as well. Overall a great game!!!"", ""Dynamic, Fun, humorus and exciting are a few words to describe this, in comparism to many endless runner games, this game is by far better and it's arguably the best endless runner game i've ever played, because there is a variety of events and missions which most endless runner games don't have, everytime i open the game i have something new to play. In addition to that it's based on a popular animated movie franchise, there is a variety of customes and locations to choose from."", ""Customes that give extra chances do nothing. I have a level 5 with 50% chance to find a moon and there is no difference. The charge ability is in an uncomfortable spot. Add a stronger sound when charged and options to move it in different spots . When abilities slow down the pace of the game it's annoying. Why not make everything at the same speed the minion is running? and why free revives are used automatically. It would be better if we could use them when we want like the charge abilities."", 'This game used to be fun. You could do special missions, unlock new places and villans, and you could play levels. In the newer update however, you never get to fight the villans, there are no levels, and you can only unlock characters which i had already bought in the old version. I wont rate it one star because its still a fun concept, but i wish it never changed', ""I've been playing this game for a month or two, but now this game has really turned very boring, the main mission in the game has been stuck for a week now asking me to open a character, the card for which never shows up... Nevertheless the game was really fun to play at the beginning, will install it again after few months.."", ""Very hard to complete any challenges when the tilting motion is not working. It is impossible to slide through w/o hitting an obstacle or falling into the abyss and having to spend coins to revive just to continue. (not to mention controlling the rocket function) It's ashame because I was looking forward to completing the Dragon Event for the new character costumes. Tried uninstalling and installing/updating the game but no luck."", ""The game is a very wonderful one... I personally never liked running games because they mostly just had one mission; keep running and eating coins till my friend introduced me to minion rush back in 2015 i juat couldn't get enough of it.. Theres different missions and activities to partake in.. There's some few things that need to be modified tho to make it more fun.. Getting tokens should be made easier and the stars we collect on the moon should be incoporated and made as valuable as tokens"", ""It's really fun but last time I tried to play it the game just kept crashing but that might be a problem with my memory.

Our Demon Monkeys have been squashing some bugs.","[""I love this game. It's fun to play but I miss the original when there weren't a bunch of ads. I understand maybe having a few here and there, but it's so riddled with ads now it ruins the game. If you die, watch an ad to continue, if you don't want to continue, you have to watch an ad anyways to get back to the menu, and that's every time.

It's a good game but whats the point in an option to watch an ad to double your coins only to press no and having to watch a 30 second unskippable ad anyways. Its ridiculous. I would literally pay to not have to watch the ads but that unfortunately is not an option. There is at least one ad every time you play. Even if you play for less than 30 seconds you still have to watch at least one 30 second ad."", 'Its a very good game ...excellence required...interesting.....adventourous..gives u pleasure at your leisure helps to co ordinate with your nervous system and and addict you ..but once you score more than 6000000 then you will feel a kind of nostalgia......but i recommend the high blood pressure people to not to play this game....it may damage your nerves or u may have several fatal problems like hypertension,alzhimer ,nervous breakdown..etc but the children dont get addicted too much with this.', 'The games fun but theres alot of ads so i have to turn of my wi fi because on a daily bases i watch att least 100 ads and it gets earetaiting sometimes but otger wise i love temple run i played when my causin had a while ago so me not having anything to do with my 5 or 6 year old brain i would ask to play on her phone and she had tons of other games but i really didnt want to play new games i recomend you down load the game just turn off youre wi fi when you play and just to hit 500 reeeeeeeeeee', ""Overall ok. I enjoy playing the game but there are problems. The option to watch an ad to keep running is a joke. If I hit no I still have to watch an ad so I might as well watch it to keep running. Also, the objective of Resurrection cannot be achieved because of the option to watch an ad to keep running. There is no where to use it and the ad doesn't work for the objective."", ""2 stars because it's still the fun game I remember from all those years ago. It is practically unplayable due to the 30 second unskippable ads that play after every run. If there was a way to pay to remove ads I would be perfectly happy but as it stands I won't be playing Temple Run anymore."", ""Downloaded for nostalgia, but it wasn't worth my time. This is practically unplayable with the insane amount of ads. The studio is clearly greedy, so they should think about a paid version."", ""I like this game very much. But only the problem in this game is that there are no levels in this game. That's why I gave the game only 4 stars.

Tweak the level design a bit, if I'm rolling, and turning a corner, how would I be able to see an obstacle right in front of me, maybe change it a bit so we have enough time to react to obstacles, some if them don't make any sense lol. 😅 2. A way to maybe remove that random air launch from a spring maneuver, it kind of stops the flow of the run that players are doing ya know? Thnx 4 reading my comment. 🙂"", ""It's a really cool game because the boss battles, rowing, and you can play as baby sonic and he's so cute, but the robots defend the tokens to get baby sonic and you need 500 tokens to get baby sonic. Well it's a really cool game and don't forget this. If you keep building and building, you can unlock characters and some rewards to like golden ring, and also some red rings to get stuff or upgrade sonic the hedgehog. And I was about to forget this.

It's like a challenge to upgrade your characters because the adds another 400 rings everytime you upgrade a character."", 'The game is quite enjoyable for it serves, but there\'s some issues. Green Hill music doesn\'t loop smoothly, Leaderboard doesn\'t function, many characters have Sonic\'s Tricks when jumping off springs.

The ads take up like half the game though, and some of them aren't even skippable which is kinda dumb considering each of them is about 30 seconds at minimum. Long story shory, it's a mobile game, but only partially a game."", ""This is a pretty awesome endless runner game!

I'm honestly glad that I redownloaded this game after 3 years"", ""When the game works, isn't showing ads after you die or killing you with cheap traps, it's a fun game that can feel a bit grindy. HOWEVER, the game constantly hiccups causing missed inputs, falling through the floor after making a jump, deaths after dodging a obstacle & breaking loop sequences (Camera gets stuck at end of loop). I rarely play this with an internet connection as its the only way to prevent ads from playing after death & there doesn't seem to be a way to stop them."", ""It's pretty basic so far, but challenging, and nostalgic enough to keep me going for now.

The controll is easy the graphics is fine the game play is good. My fav character is Teen sonic,baby sonic and tails. Give em a cheer of this delightful game. You should add a sonic dash 3 and put all the characters like hipster sonic,tails,teen sonic,amy and more il give this game 5 stars. Cuz i luv sonic games but not sonic.exe it gives me nightmares everyday when i play it.', ""I played a lot of this game years ago, and dropped off because of the little variety. I've come back to see that it's much improved. More backgrounds, more characters, graphical update, and just enough added complexity to the controls. It's a solid and enjoyable time-filler."", ""It's basically a reskinned version of Temple Run at its core, but fits well to the Sonic theme because arguably Sonic's quick step mechanics were first. It's fun, and expansions to the content over the past year have made it compelling to return to. Restoring the habitats of Sonic's tiny friends is surprisingly enjoyable even if after the first 4 areas the requirements get pretty extreme."", ""It's good! This game is a old time favourite for me! But I wish they made it easier when I come to getting the characters, still I think every kid should play this! It's amazing! And adding that it's hard to jump up on multiple things."", ""I think it's a great game and a time killer but I feel it shouldn't make you wait for a missions time to run out the reason is because it's an endless runner its gonna be bland quickly even with the events and it would keep you more busy and make you wanna play more but great game.

Please optimize the game, it lags in offline mode and I dunno why. And the events are worth grinding especially, Sonic from the movie.

I love the games you guys make!"", ""In the earlier levels, the game runs very smoothly and there are no issues with controls. However as the levels become longer and more complex (especially the later construction site ones and the Technology Park levels), the timing and responsiveness seems to waver drastically, to a point it almost feels like luck as to whether you reach the top of alternating wall-jumps. It's a shame because it really could be a top-tier game. As it is, it's simply a great concept with flawed execution."", ""The game looks amazing, and the animation is fantastic. But the trick prompts work for me about 10% of the time.

Ending is too abrupt and unsatisfying; could've done more to reward player for winning. Overall, fantastic game but could be a bit better."", 'Still not as good as it could be. Controls are fine however activating the tricks at right time seems to be nearly impossible. Most of the time my player just jumps instead of doing the trick.

Happy to try again and update the ratings if this is fixed. Please let me know when this is fixed."", 'Its a game that can be very fun, addicting, a time waster and challenging in later levels.

Before making a second game maybe you should have fixed the first."", ""Great graphics, storyline, and input of gravity. It's unfortunate that I give it a two because of the controls. I suggest that you give an option for buttons. Other than that, I appreciate the hard work you give the game. Unfortunately, I will need to uninstall the game solely on the controls. I did love the game. Good job."", 'This is the best offline game other than sf2 it demands more technique in each levels with its simple one finger control.. The game is challenging and fun.. You should try it. But full game version is paid... That is the saddest part.', ""I can't find a reason for this to be good. It's a good concept, I'll give it that. But the controls are unresponsive, as it took me 12 times just to successfully back flip, and it is way to difficult, and I ended up rage quitting at level 1-4. Part of the difficulty is from the bad controls. Fix the controls, and I'll give it a 4."", ""I'm only uninstalling this because the controls suck really bad. I have some recommendations, instead of swiping, maybe tap in the middle to jump. And I think tap to the right to accelerate and tap to the left to kick the cop if he gets too close. I think this will be a really good option. And make the levels only a bit harder and not extremely harder every level is a good suggestion."", ""I'll describe what the game is all about. -Play a level -die because the game tricked you into doing something that would lead you to your death. -constant restarts because you missed certain bonus cubes even though you clearly hit them. -eventually you get 2 stars -to get 3 stars, you then begin a coin grind by repeating levels over and over again in order to buy new tricks -you get 3 stars -rinse and repeat Conclusion: Game has potential. Ruined because of credit grind + everything else above"", ""Please add a VECTOR level editor. And why do people say there is a good story? It's just you jump from building to building then at level 11 you get saved by someone or run with them. It would be alot more engaging if you had another objective like carry that ball (that the parkour god in story 1-11 threw to you that HAD to be that important to give a stranger before he dies for it) to a base somewhere in a building with other survivors or escape the hunter when the place is compromied by huntrz""]"

This helps tide me over till the next game comes out"", 'Probably the best run game I have ever had. The variety of actions is bigger than the boring ones, like you could shoot or wall run and stuff. On the other hand, I like it that it has a story behind. Well, not too closely related but at least it is more interesting than the others. One suggestion though, that you can shoot whenever you like. Because I always see lizards running past in front of me, and I want to shoot them down. Edit: And Im also amazed that it has different jump animations.', ""Just be online before starting the game, the game won't freeze. (you can go offline after starting the run it won't freeze).

Your character hits an obstacle every few seconds and once you revive her you need lightning reflexes to stop her hitting an obstacle again, or falling down!! She moves too fast as well.

Lara Croft, you need a proper adventure game, not a running contest!! 😣', 'I used to love this game before so i reinstalled it. But after playing for awhile it keeps on freezing after atleast 2-3 games. So I need to launch the game again and again. Its kinda tiring opening it every 3games. I hate this now.

Sometimes when i'm through collecting all the clues and it's time to collect the relic. Please do something about it"", ""This is a wonderful and adventurous game but it has lots of bugs in it and needs improvement.

Good luck!!', 'Fun game with great sound effects with headphones on. Boosting thinking and decision making power of mind. Ultimately great game. Graphics are great.', ""This really is a great game. I highly recommend it. It's fun and never gets old or boring and all the levels are passable without purchasing anything. Props to the maker👍😏😉""]"

PLEASE FIX THE ISSUES SO I CAN PLAY MY FAVORITE GAME! I have loved this game for many years! For whatever reason it has been freezing on me and shutting down ALL THE TIME.

Specially the classic that just keeps going and going until you can't make a move. It's still on my very old Motorola cell phone. Can't play it cause I need a new battery and can't get one. Phones too old. I've missed playing the game for a long time. Now I've got it back. YIPEE😊👍I'm a very happy grandma."", ""I like all of the games on this app but, if you are interested in providing the best app for the ultimate gaming experience, you wouldn't limit the number of times you allow the butterflies, poker & lightening games to be played per 24 hours. I expect an underlying control issue is keeping you from allowing unlimited plays of the 3 best games. Break out of your ivory tower, get over yourself and give your followers the full use of your games. The control you release, will truly make your app #1."", ""No response from customer service, this review. Spending no more money, Uninstalling.

I'm actually trying to give you my money."", ""This game has so many adds that it's impossible to play without being annoyed. I get it you need adds to make money, but this is just too much.

Btw, the game is cool but still not worth the adds."", ""I used to play this game a long time ago, so I am downloading it again just to pass the time when I go to Dr appts and other places. It's fast and fun. Love this game, that's why I always end up coming back to this game every time. That should tell you something. It's a darn good game and it keeps your attention. Good graphics too!!! That's why I gave it 5 stars !!!😊"", 'Nice fun game, just way too many ads. Before the game, after the game, during the game, just too many ads. Dropped to two stars as the number of ads seems to increase. Start the ap - ads. Choose a game - ads. Finish a game - ads.

These are two of my favorite pc games and now I can play them both on mobile! But I think this was the deluxe version not the classic. Still, I won't complain bc it's just as good as the pc version ☺"", ""Hours of entertainment, and they don't push to terribly much for you too buy things that would help.

Sincerely Your biggest fan ."", ""It's pretty, and fun gameplay overall. However, especially lately I am finding more frustration than enjoyment. Several formats are limited to 5 plays every 24 hours. Why? As another review said, if one of these is your favorite, you can't play as much as you like. If I run out of plays I am forced to watch an ad, then upon resuming I usually lose within a short time, meaning you are just trying to get me to watch the ad. The games are not fair or skill-based, but often seem like ad traps."", 'I\'m giving five stars, it\'s so easy! I\'m a pro at poker and stuff like diamond mine! ♡(ӦｖӦ｡) °° the zen mode is too boring, the breathing thing is weird!

The ads were not oppressive and did not interrupt my gameplay in any way. I only rate 4 stars because I noticed that I have limited ""free plays"" for 3 modes. Unable to pay for anything I feel like it\'s just one of those ""free trial"" things, but I understand. What sucks is 2 things: I miss the special gem visibility in the animation of gaining a level, and the other is that one of the 3 modes is one of my favorites, Butterflies.

You will need to memorize the 3 buttons positions if yoy wish to use them mid game which is their only function with the added bonus of having such a thin sliver visible, that its is most likely you will only click on the ad. Why don't more idiots get punched right in the face for this level of stupidity? Cause snoflakes r dumb af"", ""I have played Bejeweled for over 20, starting on the PocketPC. I love the game. Unfortunately the ads completely ruin this version. Forcing me to sit through 30 seconds of a Candy Crush ad as well as continually changing banner ads are too much. I'd gladly pay $5 for the game with no ads, but that doesn't appear to be an option. Thanks for ruining one of my favorite games EA."", ""So many ads! Fullscreen 30 second ad when you start a new game, and another fullscreen 30 second ad when it's game over. Plus there are huge, very distracting banner ads about half the size of the play area running all the time. Way too many ads for the game to be fun."", 'Way too many ads. Its fun for a while, but it seems like it gives you the ""no more moves"" only after 2 or 3 levels. And it makes you watch ads after every game or return to homescreen. Not worth it; uninstalling!', ""I enjoy playing Bjeweled Classic, because it's relaxing. I play it while I'm on the bus, or train. I love winning badges. There really cool, and the game is alot of fun...I WISH I COULD STAY AT THE SAME LEVEL I WSS AT, BUT I DON'T DO SOCIAL MEDIA, SO I JUST ENJOY PLAYING THIS VERY RELAXING, & ENJOYABLE GAME"", ""In true EA fashion, the game is full of full screen ads and banner ads and. The frequency of the ads is annoying but what really gets me is the fact that they are with sound even of the game has all sounds muted. Another classic game ruined by money grabbing antics. For a publisher as big as EA, it wouldn't be such a big deal to do without the, or at least cut back on ads."", ""It's alright, hard to mess up bejeweled. My main issue is how shuffling the board is monetized, when that was just something the game used to do when you had no more moves. The 30 second ads are fairly annoying too, especially when you lose and want to return to the menu: either you watch an ad and shuffle the board (or gain more time) or watch an ad and return to the menu. Knowing EA, none of this will be addressed."", 'Diamond Mine doesn\'t work, it tells me GO! And then the game doesn\'t let me make a move, I also can\'t even press ""back"" I have to close the game completely and play the other gem games, also after getting a bunch of X2 or X number of combos and bonuses the game freezes ALL TOGETHER and shuts down and restarts that game all over again, and it\'s very annoying cuz I love this game so much, but if this keeps happening.....I\'m gonna uninstall and I don\'t want to have to do that 😓', ""Why is it that we only get 5 plays on Bejeweled butterflies & bejeweled lightening? And we get 2 play endlessly, the most boring of these games on this app? Bejeweled Zen, doesn't even have a score, or leader board. And whatz worse, u have to wait 24 hrs in order 2 play butterflies & lightening again! Whatz up with that?! & u better believe, I'm not giving u a dime to get perks in this game. Lastly, as most everyone else on this thread expressed, the ads are 2 frequent & annoying."", 'Unable to get the game to rotate to fill the screen. Can only be played with the phone turned sideways. Most of the screen is filled with nothing, and half is the game. Used to be able to play this with the phone upright, versus sideways', 'Touchscreen reading is slightly off, I have to touch the gem below the one I want in order for the game to recognise what I want to pick. Way too much of a struggle to play around such a basic control flaw when there are so many functional variants.', ""Great game, tempts you back to better your score. Just changed phone and had to start again. Google play keeps your record OK but it doesn't import to the games - or at least I can't get it to. When you install it it gives you a new player number even though you've entered your user name. Ah well, here goes...."", ""Game is like playing slots, it's all by chance, they can end your game at any time, so it's kinda senseless to even bother playing. I see no way to changec0 it without showing the next colored gems that are waiting to be added to the top. It still could be manipulated but at least your have more control over what happens based on what gems are next to drop in."", ""It will only open in landscape mode which makes it very difficult to play. So many have mentioned this problem but I don't see any responses from the devs. Please fix this already! I have A Samsung S10+ but it worked fine on my other Samsung. Please let us know how to correct this!"", ""I LOVE THIS GAME!! I play all the candy crush games as well, but this one is my favorite. No move limits, the turn is over when there are no moves left. I accidentally hit restart, and there was a confirmation screen. There's ONE ad, just when you first open it, and an optional one if you want to shuffle the board at the end of your turn. AND, you can still swap jewels while the other ones are falling. So many small features that make this game awesome."", 'I used to have the app,loved it! Got new phone a few months ago& it got uninstalled for some reason.

Very disappointed.', ""Poker is so unfair and not fun. You get stuck at the top and get forced to make certain matches. If you keep all the skulls suppressed, it'll start adding two or three of them at a time even though it's not late in the game. Or it'll even start adding a skull every turn. And using special gems to form hypercubes don't count as wildcards"", ""The challenges that this game give to my mind will, keep ones mind strong and the willingness to continue learning while my mind increase and eagerly grow as learning/ trying different things in life was intended to do. When we do the same things all the time our minds don't grow in knowledge yet, you all have created one of the best games (to me) in this world. THANK YOU"", 'Loved this game until the recent update. Now it crashes all the time, appears to have something to do with the ad rotator. They really need to fix this, made the game unplayable.', ""Alright... can I just buy an app for 2.99 and have access to the full game?? To unlock everything is more than $12, including no ads, and I think that's ridiculous for an app. I know bejeweled was a really cool game back in the day, but c'mon. Btw, not gonna spend more than maybe no ads. Also, on the mining game, whenever I clear a section and it's right next to 0 seconds, it doesn't move forward and tells me I lost. BUT, it adds time to the timer??? Please fix that. Thanks."", 'I love Bejeweled for so many reasons ever since 2012 when I first got a PC, I still play it everyday, I own all the Bejeweled games.

Job well done...Jewelinjanet', 'Totally useless for the most part.....too many ads...ridiculously way too many times and it seems to get worse as the game progresses, their way of getting you to purchase ad free gaming...at a ridiculously absurd price or buy packets that wear out way too soon, on top of what you pay to continue the lousy game..uninstall..', ""I've been a fan of the games, but this app is poorly optimized. Once in a while you get audio cuts & freezing, making it unplayable until the next restart."", 'Bejeweled is the best, biggest and the brightest puzzle game ever!!!!!! and I got the levelord badge at level 10 in classic mode and a The Gambler badge for making 10 flushes in poker mode!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and making 40 flushes in poker mode with a The Gambler Platinum Badge 💯 over 💯!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! for all the achievements and the badges. The Platinum Badge for clearing 750 hypercubes.', ""I've liked Bejeweled in many forms over the years. On this version I love the Zen mode and the butterflies. I'd play just the butterflies if I could get just that game on a separate app. On another note, I really don't like the sounds on any of the Bejeweled games. And that voice is super creepy! It's kind of dark and ominous."", 'Even though I am not real good at playing this game... I LOVE playing it. Some times I get a fantastic score .. and the next game ... Nothing.

Not only does this game increase your eye aiming, but also confidence, strategy buikding skill, but also hand eye coordination.', ""The reason I gave it 3 stars is because it is fun but there is a ridiculous amount of in app purchases that annoy me to death. The worst is probably opening the piggy bank. I worked hard for all of that gold and now it's telling me that I have to pay 3 pounds to open it. It is generally fun but the in app purchases are annoying. Also, the quality of the map is so bad. Still, a fun and addicting game. *sob* sorry gold"", 'Tried it again after a long hiatus and very disappointed to see that there\'s a ""piggy bank"" that now collects gold bars and they can\'t be unlocked unless I pay at least $2.99 for them.

I have been playing this game from 2014 till today. And the experience is like the first time i logged on it', ""I give two and BW three a four. Great game. The reason I don't give it a five, is the sneeky way it robs you of all the good you earn, then make you buy it back with a credit card to get it. Some games, once you fill the pig, will allow you to collect your gold. These don't. If you don't buy it back, it just trashes the gold you earn. The good point is, It provides help features, which allow you to continue, without ever buying any gold."", ""Love the new team bonus games. Only sad that when my tablet broke I lost all of the bonus pieces that I had collected when I had to switch to my phone to continue to be able to play. Also don't like team challenge when I get stuck with people who block my way and it takes longer to win. Stopped playing for a while because the bubbles would just shoot off in direction that I wasn't pointing at and pissed me off & now it's doing it again."", 'Entertaining for a while each time I play it.

But still love the game. xoxo"", 'Very enjoyable game until you reach high levels (around 110). Then without the help of earned bubbles it becomes impossible. The green little monsters causing extra bubbles are just a nuisance, not fun, just irritating... I then delete the App. Otherwise okay.', ""I love love love this game but for some reason it won't let me go beyond level 78 after I've passed that level I know 30 times.

I play other puzzle games and understand the challenge involved, but I play ""pet rescue"" for the challenge of rescuing pets. Having to clear 100% of the blocks 5 levels in a row misses the whole point and takes the fun out of the concept of the game in my opinion!

http://help.pou.me","[""I played this game many years ago, back when I was like 8. Im now 15, and I randomly thought of this game. Turns out, they still had my Pou from back then linked to my email!! It was so refreshing to go back in time really. It's indescribable really. It was such a simpler, easier time. This app means alot for some reason. Thank you for being a part of my childhood."", ""The only issues I have is that the game can crash when increasing the friends list. Also when you save your game and re-log in on a different device, it can take you back to where you were a month or two ago; meaning that your level will drop and you won't own those items you once had. But apart from that, the game is decent. Even-though it hasn't had any noticible updates since 2013 -15."", ""This game is nice but one thing bugs me. There are so many interesting outfits and options but they're locked from level 20-80. At least some of the things should have been freely available at first hand so that the user can try on and experience something new for their pou that will make them crave to earn more as the levels progress. Seeing them already too far ahead makes me not want to try for more."", 'Pou is a classic! Pou has been one of my favorite mobile games since I was little. Pou can get a bit boring but it is fun!

I went to buy it and i wasnt on a high enough level so i payed to unlock it, i didnt have enough money to actually buy it so i made the money i needed and i go to buy it and i have to unlock it AGAIN.

Let’s play!","[""Best game ever! This games is so addicting, it puts you in a situation where you can't get tired of swiping... Every level and episode is challenging in it's own way and there are many features and rewards that are really exciting in the Candy Kingdom. I've been playing it since a long time ago and i've gotten three diamond trophies and still on the hunt for more achievements... If there are more than five stars, i would happily rate it because this game deserves it.!"", ""Addictive, fun and soothing. BUT...sometimes (lots of the time) I wonder if the game was designed to make you use your boosters or purchase them. I've observed that (more often than not) when I fail a level, it's usually by 1-3 moves. It's apparent (to me) it's by design and not coincidence."", ""I always come back to this game. it is peaceful and fun. There is something about all the Candy Crush games they give you so much entertainment and you're fun to do! Current updates make the game newer each time you play and give you more opportunities. The Candy Crush family is so exciting to be a part of. It's never the same old game. Stay updated change it give you new new chances to win more. Keep it up CCF, You're one of the best games there is!"", ""You guys changed something about this game making it quite harder. Before, when am using boosters, as long as i haven't swiped or made a move, i could easily go back, then come back again till my boosters align the way i want to make it easier and fun to work with. But now, i can't do that cause each time i want to go back even tho i haven't made a move, you make me loose a life and make the whole booster a waste cause it hasn't been used and it's quite harder since. I play a level for weeks!!!"", ""On level 6,347. Getting to REALLY dislike this game...so many changes, like only 5 candy drops now per game. And now when you lose a game, you lose...no option to buy gold bars or use the ones in your bank to continue the game and lives get used faster. I've always enjoyed the challenge, and it used to be fun, but now it's becoming a money pit and I won't let myself go there. Shame on you, King."", ""This game is really fun. I like how they have started to add more challenges lately. However I'm disappointed about the glitch with sending and receiving lives. I'm getting over 50 request for lives a day, when they are supposed to be sent as free lives to play. Usually the creators are quick to fix any bug issues, but I will say I'm a little upset that it's been over 2 weeks and it seems like more glitches are just adding on to the game.... what's happening??"", ""Probably my favorite game but one thing... I'm at a significantly higher level than a lot of my friends who play. I'm unable to easily send them lives. I have to scroll back hundreds of levels to access most of them. There should be a friends section that shows active players, stats, and send gift buttons. This is really the only complaint I have after 6+ years of playing. Obviously I love the game though."", ""It's not glitchy so thats good. Wish it wouldn't give me suggestions after 2 seconds. I like to figure it out on my own. I'm not in a rush. Maybe like 7 seconds later would be better. Amd I have gold bars. But I cant seem to use them. When I'm playing it said I filled it to 60 twice. When I try to use them to buy candy it wants me to pay for it. Even though I earned them."", 'Repetative game with lottery function. Kill your time if you wish, but this game is more of luck than skills. Eg. Some of the tracks are based on pure luck. You just cannot pass them without spending extra items, turns... so spending money eventually (that is where I put my line). Not worth of my time anymore', 'Really very bad experience while playing some levels. Further, my fantastic 5 team is useless. No team work. None logs in and win. I wish you that you provide additional boosters free while playing some very hard levels. Hope you understand, its not all about making money, its about the fun and craziness you should look after from the people for your game. Please reduce the prices of gold bars. And please put me in some other team who wants to play and enjoy the Candy Crush Saga. Hope u got it.', ""Fun game. However, the creators have become greedy. I remember the days basic candy costs 79p AND you had a unlimited life for a set amount of time. Now, it's a minimum of 2.99 for basics and no unlimited hearts and even then, if you lose all your lives, by the time the counter gives you another life, your bonus has ran out meaning you have to BUY MORE. Asking my bank for a full refund as I think it's pretty unfair. This game used to be good now its greed!!!"", 'Love the game a lot! However, the public contest is not fair to those who are very far in the game since the levels are harder for us, unlike those who are not yet far in the game or probably just starting the game. We should not be paired with them at all since their level are much easier. They are likely to win every contest. I feel it should be like the episode race since we are playing the same levels. Kindly attend to it!', ""I'm not getting any boosters when the games is done. The spins but no candy n a lot of boards are hard help me out give me something to stay active what's up with the candy booster.when the candy jar is supposed to be at the left top corner of the board. And the booster spins but I don't get nothing. In fact I been playing y'all spam games in these games are boring anyways. So I'll be deleting tomorrow all of them"", ""Better not ever crash because regardless of whether your connected with Facebook or not they will take everything from gold bars to every buff and you won't even get a sorry! Do not recommend this game! Progress is saved from Facebook but only the level your on nothing else?? Go figure?? But they say their working on it. Been working on it for years! Lies! ???"", 'Fun to play? Let me say, I would not advise a compulsive gambler to play this game. The game is rigged, meaning it is designed to make you spend as much money as possible to purchase items for the game. When a game has to rearrange the pieces because of no more possible moves, then the game is designed to create roadblocks forcing you to use the tools you must buy to advice in the game. It gets one star, because of how deceptive the creator is tricking you to spend money at every level.', ""Great game, only downfall is I have a colour defect (some colours look the same as others) so when I get the levels with the bombs I have to ask someone to do it for me as I can't work out which colours they are plus when you get to the higher levels I noticed you don't get through as many levels as you did at the start sometimes you don't get through any in the five life's, also would be great if after so many levels you do you could get an extra life added on"", ""This game is fun - when you actually play it. In between each level there are 8 separate pop ups that are frustrating, annoying and make the whole game not worth it. After you complete 1 level you have to click out of pop ups about you finishing the level, receiving points, seeing leader boards that no one could care about, feeding some dragon, introduced to a new sub plot, click to the new level, and finally you can play! It's a pain in the ass to say the least."", 'I was enjoying candy crush over the years and this is the first time I am giving it a ratings, and after I will uninstall the app. Reason for doing so is that the app was good that am addicted to the game, now every day they make some rubbish changes that makes the game less interesting. Why do King have to cut down amount of reward to five, it should be unlimited. Now the game get so boring. When I ran out of lives, I can play a game that I already pass to get rewards. Now it is limited .', 'Pretty addicting and fun game to play on my commute to and from work. Only critique so far is wish the game would explain how the new types of lock tiles work as you play for the 1st time they appear. For me I turned off hints so it would stop showing me which pieces to swap cause it made game too easy imo but I still want to know the new concepts in the game. Should add toggle for tutorial on/off and keep hints on/off option as a seperate option.', 'Its entertaining. I am doing this for the free candy. I do find myself getting into it when I have down time. I can see how it can get addictive. Do i really have to Wright 500 characters to get this. It seems a bit excessive. But I guess I will keep typing till it reaches the 500. I woke up this morning and made my morning coffee as I always do. Then I sit to relax and enjoy my morning before work. The as nature calls. I grab my phone and take my morning seat. I start to play and find myself', 'I have just been introduced to this game by my daughter, it is very addictive. Review update, OMG I am getting dark circles and bags under my eyes, I get into bed and think well I will just have one game ha ha no chance one hour later I am still battling the candies. The downside is that if I run out of target support I have to purchase them, I have purchased once but feel this is not a road that I can go down when income is restricted.', ""I'm using Samsung A9 (2018), I found the response when slide the most right hand side, up and down or left to right (for the most right 2 candy), the movement is not responsive even it can sense my highlight, but cant move. this happen almost when I just change to use this new mobile, I assume it is not my mobile problem since I didn't got same problem when usong other apps"", ""I thought I would never find a game so awesome and so epic as this one. It is a real brain teaser because you got to figure out how to do many different tasks at the same time with being limited how much you move. Many years ago, I used to watch my wife play and now that I got the game now, I'm very addicted to this."", ""Candy crush is my obsession since forever! I've passed 5000 levels till today! But i have been disappointed lately with the changes you have made! Why did you change that with exiting a level without using a single move takes away one life?!?! Sometimes you push the wrong level by mistake, that woukd cost you a life! Also the daily wheeel almost akways stops at the fish... I have won the fortune box only once! Which makes me sure that its impossible thats its just luck!"", ""This game can give you a headache and blury vision. I had that experience on stage 1136. I don't know what happen. I think it is because loop music and the graphic. On that stage it is very wierd candies position. When you blast some candies its move around and make my head feel like spinning watching its movement."", 'No words for it.it is very great.i like this game. I can spend my leisure time by playing it. Some time level goes hard but by never giving up will help to upgrade level. We can easily paly this game. We can gaet different types of playing elements which helps to increase our level easily. It gives us entertainment while playing. While palying we can get different types of gift whch make us more easier to play the game.we can share our lives with friends.we can also ask friends life. It is nice.', 'Loving these games. Graphics are clean and bright with beautiful colours, the only problem, soo addictive. My partner is a couple hundred levels over me but has been playing for years,. He showed me these games. Just remember to how to get the most out of the least moves,. Sometimes very frustrating but once u pass a hard one that took ages u will be very satisfied with your self.', ""So far this game is not only fun but winnable. Makes all the difference to me. As someone on a fixed budget it's nice to not have to spend real money on it . Only thing I truly don't like about it is the pig, you earn the gold bars by playing the game but then you have to pay to open the pig. The ads we watch should be paying for the piggy bank. 😔"", ""I love the game when it works but when there's issues and there's nothing on the multiple choice list pertaining to your issue. Your stuck. My game won't connect to my Facebook. I've logged out of Facebook and back in. I use to be connected to Facebook through my game, but all of a sudden for whatever reason my game was no longer connected to my Facebook and won't reconnect. If I'm not reconnected then I guess I will have to uninstall"", 'Not as much fun as it used to be; even more glaringly obvious that ""the fix is in"" and you won\'t pass a level until the game decides you will, and at this point, I don\'t really care tbh. The many recent changes designed to limit the number of boosters collected doesn\'t help things, either.', 'The game itself is addictive but perhaps too much focus on silly storylines and just a number of clicks between games (not ads, just results menus and transitions). But all in all, good game. Never thought it would be quite as much fun', 'The experience is not good I can hear lot of poping ice blocks. Not one of my ice blocks were broken I had 3 trys and 3 striped candy when the game ended I still had 11 ice blocks to break. How is that possible. It seems that the progress a person is very very slow and a long process spending lots of money and getting nowhere this game use to be fun but now its costly and stressfull', 'Primarily, a game of getting a lucky board, in app purchases or watching long ads. Recent updates and changes have taken much of the skill required to complete a level out of the game. If you have a lot of money to spend on boosters then you will enjoy the experience.', ""It's decent. I recently started playing again. All was fine until I couldn't accept my prize. It says to connect to claim my prize. But connect what? I have updated the app, log out and in multiple time but nothing seems to be working. So.. Yeah.. 1 star."", ""I always come back to this game and it's very cool...I noticed that when I ask friends for extra lives and someone sent it to me when I try to accept it, it will cancel the extra life but will not appear for me to play. I just received 4 extra lives but unable to use them. Kindly work on this. Thanks"", 'Played for years, but will probably uninstall soon. High levels are pretty much designed to need boosters to complete, and the constant hints and promopts to buy have become more than annoying, plus recent changes to lose lives just by backing out of a board without making a move, etc have made the game much less enjoyable. It has become slick and gimmicky lately, and bore some.', 'this is Fun and challenging and a great way to stay sharp! Well I should be sleeping but want to be first. I am close! A great way to avoid the television. 2nd review. I Am a senior and this game keeps my mind active. 3rd review. As usual I am enjoying my candy crush! Can not sleep so I am playing Candy Crush. Great game.....wonderful game. No one home good time to play.', ""Love it great game. Lots of fun. Very challenging.Great game addicting.Can not stop playing. Just gets more fun every day. More fun every day. Just can't stay 3. Just keep playing and playing. So much fun. Just keep playing and playing. Awesome game. I wish I could stop playing but that is impossible."", ""I don't consider impossible levels a challenge. If anything mildly boring or frustrating. This game is rigged to let you pass at it's own tempo. That's not a challenge. At best this game is a idle time waster and at worse a slightly cynical pyramid scheme. Although the fake profiles that give 6 stars seem impressed! 🤣🤣"", ""Game is what it is. What really irks me is all the pop ups in between the levels. I don't care what other players are on, who is beating me in the weekly race or and whatever else is the pop ups. Also what's with the show works at the end of the levels. I just want to play!

I've played games like this one like Candy Crush but I didn't expect there to be a Pokemon version. Thanks for making this game. Also, I like the Pokemon designs and colors. The legendary, shinies, and ultra beast's are very nice as well. Though I wish you guys added a Zeroara, that would make the game extra nice.This game really deserves 5 stars."", 'No way to cloud save or backup game at all. After losing access to my older phone, I had to restart from the beginning with a new game, for which I am very sad. Feb 4, 2020: 2nd time to start from level 1 because customer service is so very slow (near nonexistent) and cloud save is nonexistent. I love this game but down graded the rating for poor customer service and no backup of the game.', ""It was good while it lasted, I've been playing since the game came out and there has been no support from developers since 2018. In another month, it'll be 2 years since the last update. I've beaten almost every level now and captured every Pokemon. I used mega start ups on every Pokemon now and I cannot claim anymore, once my item thing is full and I cannot claim anymore prizes, I guess I'll stop playing this game because I won't be able to claim items anymore from the competition stages."", ""I absolutely loved Pokemon Shuffle whe I got it on the 3DS some years ago, and I still love it here on mobile!

They don't need to be, and it just decreases the overall quality of the game. If the sound files weren't so compressed, I would give this game 5 stars."", ""Blatant cashgrab. Nintendo/pokemon team doesn't make any effort to put games to the mobile market. - No individual music for stages, mega evolutions. - First sequence, tutorial, is downright awful: you spend 10 mins of taping exactly where app says to tap. - Repetetive gaming due to auto-manage there's no point of even thinking of your choices - Waiting for hearts (1game=1heart) that you can only get via paying with diamonds that mostly could only be bought with real money"", 'After coming back from a long hiatus I\'d think the game would be less buggy. But after a few games I decided to use a crystal on a competitive stage. Pressed ""all done"" to start the stage and it lags me out, using and losing the crystal without having me replay the stage.. my girlfriend also plays on her iPhone and is constantly forced off the app.', ""Fun game! A good way to pass the time. The 4* is because of the question after every time losing or not catching they ask if I want to use jewels when I don't have any. They keep wanting you to buy jewels and it's quite annoying."", ""I have recently lost an account (that I had put in a lot of effort into) to the Transfer. I had all the other info except the mobile's Client ID- which is no longer accessible. It would be much easier for all players (myself and others) if their account was just part of/connected to their Google account and didn't require all these 'gymnastics' to transfer their account. Also, this Hearts and Diamonds system limits playability. Although f2p, there is too much that tries to make the player pay."", ""The game itself is fun, However, it is rigged. The catch percentage plummets after the second map and even with a 90% rate they break out of the pokeball ironically 90% of the time. Power ups way too expensive and they do it to make you pay to play. After stage 140 it becomes impossible to win. There are stages where they deliberately give you no combos. Make no mistake it is NOT random it's designed to make you pay which is sad cuz I really enjoyed this game. Shame on the developers."", ""Overall this game I has worn itself out. I've been playing this game a long time but theres really never anything new. The event stages are always the same, they're repeating pokemon from earlier in the game, and it's just gotten boring. Theres 800+ pokemon and you keep repeating the same ones? Please excite me again"", ""I really love this game, I find it really fun and I enjoy the pokemon mixed with puzzle solving. However, it seems like every month something happens to this app that makes it unplayable for me. It's unacceptable that a game isn't QA tested so as to ensure that you are able to accept a terms of service agreement.

I legitimately enjoyed this game until I got past the 200th level and now it takes literally 5+ hearts for just one catch that should be simple. I\'ve actually uninstalled because there is nothing more to this app beyond that point, what a shame.', ""Good game with good gameplay, no ads.

Please fix this and or help"", ""After not playing for years since getting it on my 3DS, I've picked this up again recently and been playing it each day at a time.

Easy to build up coins, too, if you just login everyday."", 'Love this game as much as I loved it on my 3ds. The only thing that doesnt work is the energy system which most mobile games fall victim to. Would be perfect if you could play as much as you want, when you want.', ""The game makes you use hearts just to play. It's not like literally every other puzzle game on the market, where you only lose a heart when you lose the puzzle, but win or lose. Dumb design and should be changed. Was fun until I realized the entire point of the game was to get people to spend money almost immediately. Pass."", 'Its not a bad game, just feels rigged. What are the odds of a 98% catch rate fail 5-6 times in a row. It just isnt fair how you wait hours to refill your hearts, only to have it just be thrown away replaying levels to catch something. It states you can play the game without paying but, clearly they are pushing you to pay for coins, for the great balls... such a disappointment', 'I used to love playing this game, and it would be great to play, if I could. I just downloaded this game again after a couple years of not playing it, only to now be stuck on the Terms of Use screen! I cannot play the game without agreeing to the Terms, but when I try to click on ""I agree"" it does not respond, no matter what I do. What a disappointment...', ""Well the game downloaded just fine. But when it brought me to the start/ title menu it ask's you to agree to terms of service. Problem is that menu will not allow me to press the agree or disagree buttons for some odd reason. I cannot get past this menu, and subsiquintly was not able to play the game. So one star."", ""Pretty decent game. No ads. I have enjoyed this game on both my DS's. And am now playing it on my phone. The game can get quite difficult on some levels. But still a enjoyable game."", ""I have this game on my 2ds, which you should get. I also love the online challenges! It pushes you to do good on levels for S ranks, which open expert levels. I have two Charizards, one shiny and one normal. The mega evolution really helps, especially on bosses. I can't wait until I unlock mewtwo, because I have the Y stone for it. The one star I didn't put in was because on the online challenges, I got so close to getting a Charizardite X, but someone passed me at the last second. It's a 92%."", 'The game has a lot of micro transactions. While it warns you that you don\'t need to spend money it has many ""trappings"" which can trick and influence younger players into needing to get jewels for great balls (which don\'t have a perfect chance) for Pokemon they have mega gems for which have very low catch probability.', 'I first played pokemon shuffle when it came out on the DS. Loved it back then and still love it now. The wait for hearts is pretty nice because I feel like without it I would be glued to my phone 24/7. That said, there are some levels that feel like deliberate heart wasters as they require specific puzzle placement.', ""It's a fun little game but easy to lose interest when you have to wait so long to gain lives, I still play but only when I can be bothered so few and far between. The cost of gems is ridiculous considering you don't get much in return too so I wouldn't purchase those."", 'It\'s not just ""pay to win"", it feels rigged more than random - especially because no % is shown other than the catch bar and special effects won\'t trigger and the game\'s feeling is that you won\'t ever need to get better because the only thing that matters are objects you can pay or earn after heavy grinding (that will take you days even if you log 3 times per day) and diamonds you can buy in their shop. Also, it gets really boring.', 'This is a very simple puzzle game with adorable pokemon in it. I play it all the time but I get frustraited sometimes when i lose all of my lives. I am glad that they made hearts a regenitive thing though. I like the daily rewards too, as they do not go down if you skip a day.', ""Well it is fun and addicting but please, do not force us to spend money just to win the game. Find some other way to earn money from your players not by jamming the puzzle on purpose so that we can't pass unless we pay to win? C'mon, you guys are already rich enough."", ""It's fun for the first little bit, then it becomes clear that you have to dump considerable money into it in order to progress. I get that it's f2p, but just makes it sort of boring after playing through the first couple dozen stages."", 'This game is a hard cash grab. The user interface is very bad. It does not allow you to sort the different Pokemon by their ability. I have yet to figure out how the percentage works when trying to capture the Pokemon. The timed Pokemon are next to impossible to get with out using jems. The hearts they use are scarce and rare to get.', ""Just contacted support about 20,000 lost coins and the reply was they don't replace missing coins or hearts, so remember that is you are spending your own money. Glitch or not, if they're gone, they're gone. If I could give 0 stars for that response and 20k missing in the game I would."", ""If you like Pokemon, this is a really simple time taker that can entertain you while waiting in line or even on the toilet. It's enjoyable and engaging."", ""**if anyone has a 'newer' phone and can't click the agree button, it's because the hit box is glitchy. try doing it in pop-up mode. it worked for me.** the game is very cute and fun to play. I've played it on my 3ds also, but i like it better on mobile. it runs smoothly and the difficulty increases over time. eventually you may have to start paying for items to help with each puzzle to win, but it's mostly luck."", 'This game is broken and stole all my coins. I just wanted to catch Absol and I beat it over 25 times each time giving me a less than 30% and with great ball amit only gave 40% chance. Even after spending every coin I had, I had not gotten any closer. Do not waste your time here.', 'If you are unable to accept at the Terms of Use screen, go into your phone settings and adjust the Display Reolution down as low as it will go. Then, the ToU screen should accept your input. After accepting, you can switch back to your desired resolution and play.', ""Genuinely good game. I played it when it first came out a while back and I enjoyed it then too. Definitely Pokemon's best Mobile game."", ""A fun but simple game where you can catch a variety of pokemon. If you think the games too easy at first then don't worry because the levels later on in the game are harder. If that's still not enough then you can choose to play expert levels and see how you fare there. To some up my experience, I really enjoy this game and I hope this helps you decide if you want to install the game or not."", ""Fun. Cute. Pokemon. Interesting stages and varying levels of difficulty throughout the game stages. Nothing requires money and there is low pressure to purchase. Which is so refreshing. I am disappointed that I can't have my profile backed up on the goggle game system. Or some opinion to save to my account as to not lose anything when/if I have to change devices."", ""The quality and sound effects are really good and that it's a really fun game to play. I like the fact that this game has shiny pokemon and big challenges! Like a high score! This game is really fun to play! That you so much!!!"", ""Game's great: music, graphics, no adverts. However, it does kind of bug you for real money.""]"

Enjoy!","[""I downloaded this game just to try out something new for myself and now I'm into it! I love that there are a few maps which I found it a bit complicated but then turn out to be really simple, if you just CHANGE THE WAY YOU LOOK AT IT. It's a relaxing game, meanwhile you can still practice your brain, but more than just that, it helps me to look at life differently. Thank you!"", ""It's absolutley amazing you can use it anywhere; everywhere at any time you like. I've had this game for a while now and I am only just reviewing it as i have found no flaws at all. Awesome. I guess it is for ages 7+ as i think that children under the age of seven will not be able to process the fact that it is a dot to dot but it is in the form of pixels on your device. I also think that it 's background can be varied in different patterns and colours as it is boring having just the same thing."", ""Game is decent but the ads, ads, ads, ads, ads, ads, ads, ads, ads.... Most game levels only take seconds to complete, though occasionally there's a head-scratcher. So you end up with ads several times a minute! And many of the ads will automatically open playstore no matter what you do, so really you'll quite likely end up spending more time fighting off ads than playing the game. I don't mind reasonable ads, we all gotta pay the bills, but come on guys, this just ain't cool."", ""It's a fun game, but theres too many ads. They play pretty much after every 1-2 levels. This is one of the least user-friendly games I've ever played. Also theres an ad that's plays whenever you want a hit that closes straight away and you cant get another hint ad for some reason. You just have to sit through an ad without a hint. Very disappointing experience"", ""This game is so elegant and relaxing that it is the only one I've redownloaded and given 5 stars. The sheer number of puzzles is impressive, and the varieties of sizes and types keep Flow entertaining. My only criticism is that the difficulty of the puzzles plateaus despite increasing grid size. I'm solving most of the 10×10s in under a minute each, but still enjoying the game overall. Well done!"", ""Haven't played Android version, but played it all the time on my Kindle when I was 5 or so. I love the game. And to all the people complaining about ads, use the magic trick of turning off your WiFi on the device. Boom, no more ads! Just make sure you're saved to the WiFi address so you can get back on when needed."", ""Did rate it 5* but recently they've added a ridiculous number of long unskippable ads - they're every 3 games or so, which is usually less than a minute! Was such a good game but it's basically unplayable now :( EDIT: Seem to have stopped the unskippable ads again so back to 5*! Seriously addictive game, challenging enough to be interesting without being so hard it's frustrating!"", ""A really good puzzle game that I have spent many hrs playing, so good that I paid for the extra levels and I don't normally pay for anything extra, I have played the other Flow Free games and enjoyed them too and I like the challenge as the levels get harder and would recommend this to anyone who's searching for a really good puzzle game 👍"", ""Fun and extremely challenging! I feel like this game really gives my brain a challenge so it can improve and grow. It also includes strategy and major thinking. Please at least try this game out before judging the game by comments/reviews and try this great game! It doesn't even advertise itself which also makes it a great game! Nothing in my opinion is wrong. It also infrequently gives out ads. I will at least watch add for the sake of this great game, AMAZING JOB Big Duck Games LLC!"", ""I'm giving every person that considers buying this app a heads up. Your progress will be synced between devices, but not your purchases. So buying an ad free version on your android phone, and then logging into the play store will sync your progress. However, buying the ad free version doesn't transfer to your other android devices. If you want to play this game ad free you will have to pay $4.99 for each android device."", ""It's a good game to play when you have nothing to do. There's not alot of ads wich is great for most people I personally didn't mind the ads. I only rate 5 stars because I've been playing this game for 2 years now and I've gotten really good at it."", 'This app updated on 15 January and since then it has really not performed upto its previous 5-star standard. It always freezes on opening and sometimes during, which had not prior to this update. The daily challege also changed in this iteration. The first challege is unlocked dut each successive one remains locked until the prior one is completed. This is not a positive chage for those with attention issues. Please undo these changes and I will change my rating to five stars.', ""Played this game like couple of years ago and found it enjoyable and decided to get it again and there's just TOO MANY ADS NOW!!! its ridiculous because it just ruins the whole mood I understand that there needs to be ads but its just too much that i cant justify playing it Youre literally watching ads for a longer timw than youre actually playing the game"", ""Played this a few years ago and loved it. Now the ads are just unbearable. 30 second ad every 3 or 4 levels. Wouldn't mind a short ad every 10 levels or whatever but this is just annoying. Feels like they're trying to force me to pay to remove them."", ""I've enjoyed playing this game for years now, and remain a fan of the gameplay. The daily puzzles are challenging without being too difficult and the included games are numerous and stimulating. Most content may be purchased for $2 to remove ads. I play daily and find it to be a great stress reliever and solid way to keep my mind active."", 'This is a great game however I cant afford to give it a higher rating due to the fact that the ads are incessant. They are absolutely relentless. They pop up in the middle of levels, after every level, and everywhere in between. It completely and utterly ruins the experience.', 'Relaxing, fun, and enjoyable, this app is perfect for all ages! Simple for kids (no offense), and stragetic for adults! I recommend it for anyone who wants to find a good app to play in their free time.', ""So I looked at the reviews and saw too buggy, too many ads, ect. But here's the thing. They say it's ad free with no in app purchases and not only does it have ads but it also has in app purchases so we literally get lied to before even playing the game"", ""The game itself is fantastic and my favorite offline game! I highly recommend. However, recently I have been getting ads with sound that can't be muted or closed which means that I can no longer play in public without headphones. I'd rather stop playing than be cornered into paying for the ad-free version."", ""In 2014 my neurosurgeon saw me playing this game and recommended it along with any problem solving puzzles and games. I had just had an aneursym clipped. Not only do I find relaxation while playing I'm also exercising a part of my brain that was damaged."", ""The game is already ad supported, but each new update ads a higher frequency of ads appearing. I used to be able to finish 10-15 levels before an ad, now I get one every 2-5 levels. I was willing to pay the $4.99 to purchase, but user experience is so poor that I'm reluctant to give the money. It feels like the makers are making the game unplayable to force you to buy it or else make a bunch of money by crushing you with ads."", ""Awesome game, probably my number one game! I'm actually a freelance brain surgeon and thanks to this game I'm finally making ALL the right connections, no more goofballs from me! This game is better than most brain-type games, I've paid to unlock all packs but you should have a donate thingy as well, I don't need to buy the hints, I'm a lawyer remember. Highly recommended! Please make another with, I dunno, time travel and goats? All my friends here at NASA would love that... to turn back time."", ""This used to be a fun game. Now they have an advertisement after nearly every puzzle. To make matters worse the advertisements are timed so you have to view the whole ad. Very frustrating!!!! Don't waste your time on this one."", 'This game makes good use of the touch screen is very easy to learn and some levels are a bit challenging. One complaint, after completing several hundred levels the app crashed and despite using ""play games"" after reinstalling I had to start from scratch. Possible improvements, a head to head mode, ability to play user selected music in background and the obvious removal of ads. At least not so many.', 'Super fun and addictive. Simple to use and understand. Plenty of modes and very few ads which is great, overall just an enjoyable time waster (in a good way)', ""I have each Flow Game installed & love them all. But THIS is the One: inthe starter pack, as u learn it gets harder. After, there's many packs to get harder or not: many options, perfect! This one also intros the other Flow games (Hex, Warp, Bridges etc) for ur next move! Last: Ads exist for a reason (dev support). Before PlayPass, I happily paid a small sum to remove ads & support the team. This is worth the try: Play It!"", 'I enjoy this game. I believe it is helping keep my brain sharp as I continue through the aging process. The more puzzles I complete, the faster I am able to move through the packets. Thank you.', 'Very fun game!! It makes you think harder and is very fun to play!!! Ads are very tame and do not pop up as much as you would find in any other apps. I give all 5 stars, to this amazing game!! I will for sure be playing more of this fun game!', 'Ads! Ads! Ads!!!! another victim of greedy developers, forcing you to watch ads every 1-5 levels. beautiful game, destroyed by ads. If you dont mind exiting the game and re-entering every 2minutes, play it.', 'BEWARE !!! You will never be able to have a perfect Achievement status if you make mistakes. After years of play, I achieved all games as starred perfect packs, but not so in Achievements. The unpublished rules don\'t allow for human error or striving to be rewarded for correcting mistakes for stars. Publishers quote.....""There is no way to change those checks to stars -- that is just the way the achievements were designed.""', ""Let me say I love this game, it's calming in fact. I know there is ads, Im fine with ads, but I am not fine with a ad in the middle of my time trial. There should be no ads during a time trail, I extremely hate that, thats why Im giving it a 1 star."", 'Having to watch a 30 second video ad after every level is ridiculous. Especially when puzzles are completed in a couple of minutes, you spend more time watching ads. DELETE!!!!', ""LOVE this game. The game itself is 5 star. The free version has SO many ads it's no longer fun to play. If you buy the game for just a few dollars it may be better."", 'I had to uninstall it after two days..... . Every second time you play, they show you an advert. If you play the game twice, you have to watch a 1 minute advert video. Its annoying!!! . Game is not bad, but boring and too many adverts.', ""Fun game that offers a good bit of entertainment. The levels in the first few packs are pretty easy but they do get challenging as you get to the 10x10's"", ""I love this game it's my favorite not to many ads, fun daily challenges,and its simple, (in my opinion that's good) and I really hope they don't do to many updates and ruin it like has been happening with all my other games."", 'This game is best offline game.but i have completed all the levels and i need more level because in my job i get off and during that i get board got so i request if possible launch new pack in a 2 weeks or atleast a month. By the way the game is awesome and i really enjoy this game thank you guys.', ""Fun. But the UI needs a little work. The hint button is easily hit, and there's no confirmation - so your three free hints are easily wasted. But, I guess the developers are trying to train us to not to buy tips? -\\_(o.O)_/-"", 'Ive played this game everyday for nearly 2 years. Yesterday it just decided it wouldnt open anymore!! Its challenging and fun but im really upset over not being able to keep my daily score going.. its lost the review 2 stars', 'Love this app, one of the most relaxing ones out there. I have downloaded and beat this 3 times in the last 5 years. Nothing compares']"

This was my favorite game at one time, but now it's getting uninstalled."", ""For more than a month this game has been freezing up, sometimes for more than a week. When it is working it's only for a few minutes then it freezes up again. I'm getting very discouraged, wondering if it's ever going to be fixed. When it was working right I would have given it 5 stars but now it's gettig 0. Today, Jan. 24, I saw that it needed to be updated so I did. So far it's working perfectly. Welcome back Panda Pop! I missed you. 5 stars again. Keeping my fingers crossed."", ""I've lost out on so many prizes I've won. I miss out on challenges. It freezes constantly to the point I can't play for weeks.

And it's really Challenging. I love it. Made it finally to 100. Awesome. It gets More Challenging and now you really have to draw imaginary lines 🤣👍💯🤣. Love the Challenge 👍"", ""Love the game. Love also that when I've lost, they will give new hearts to keep on playing, because I would have to uninstall and not play anymore if I didn't receive the new chances to play. I'm not able to buy the additional chances/hearts. Great game!"", 'Fun and easy. Great way to entertain your brain without over stimulating it.', 'One of the best mobile games out there and has been outstanding for years. Constant update to keep you interested.

Should you have any feedback or issues - we’re always ready to assist!,"[""Beautiful real life like pictures to put together. Some puzzles, after you complete them will tell you information about the puzzle that are really interesting. It helps to calm you down if you are stressed, that's the main reason I tried this. Then I showed my husband and now we pick out what puzzle we both want to put together. It's a fun way to spend time together. Really love this app. I know I will use this all the time."", ""Pick a Card Bonus is the lowest of any fraudsters, you watch the video and you don't get to pick a card or a list of others games appear that you have to play in order to get the coins. The puzzles are great. Update - your ad programer is piss poor. Have you even played the game? You really need to work on the problem.😠 February 7, 2020 The problem resolution has improved. Thank you very much.🤗 I do have one request, could you please get more interior designs packs? Thank you for this app.😘"", ""I loved this app, but after playing for some months, I'm too frustrated to continue. On more puzzles than not, I'll be about 75 to 85% complete, when it glitches. When I get out of the puzzle and come back in to it, whatever puzzle pieces I had free on the board (not connected to any other piece) are the only ones left on the board. All of my put-together pieces are put back in the sidebank of pieces. Am I the only one this is happening to?!"", ""I love this app but there are way to many ads involved with gameplay. Pictures/graphics and actual gameplay are great, but you are required to watch a lengthy ad in between each puzzle. The banner ad next to the puzzle pieces can be easily tapped and it pulls you out of the game. When you exit that you're forced to watch another ad just to get back to where you were. Very frustrating!!"", 'Overall this a great puzzle app. There are a few things that would make it even better. When zooming, it seems to only zoom to a random quarter of the puzzle, and you cannot change the zoom location until that quarter is finished. If I am missing something, please It would be great to be able to scroll when zoomed, in order to see other parts of the puzzle. Second, having a separate tray or multiple trays to hold pieces without cluttering the main puzzle area would be a welcome improvement.', 'Love the puzzles but too often don\'t get the rewards for watching videos. Looking for a better app. Update: recent upgrade to game visuals but ads still only work occasionally, sometimes you get rewards, sometimes not. The rest of the time you get told ""no ads available"" - usually after being offered a big reward for watching. I refuse to subscribe because it is very overpriced. Update: response doesn\'t address the issue of watching ads and receiving no reward!', ""I really like this better than many of the other puzzle games. What? I do have a problem with is if you're not really careful you find yourself going into some sort of app. Like Velveeta cheese, or even the Play Store. If you just use the arrow, you can back up into the puzzle, but it's a pain in the butt. . I really do like the choice of puzzles.. It would be a little bit better if the pieces were not so long Getting where It needs to go"", ""I've had this app for years, and it used to be amazing. Now they give you 20 free puzzles and everything else is just a mess of microtransactions. A previous purchase is no longer honored after the app was completely reinvented. It's frustratingly complicated for what should be a simple puzzle game. Look elsewhere for entertainment. This isn't the gem is once was."", ""The latest update's layout is all soft pastels, soft and sweet - and SMALL print, with NO way to track my personal progress. I asked my husband to revert back to a save!! I loved the previous layout. With it on my tablet (although not the phone) once an image was selected, it showed which puzzle sequences I had completed or had in progress. I enjoy the puzzles, but I also like the challenge of completing all options of a given picture. Some images can be very challenging with rotation!"", 'This is a fun game as long as you have time to do nothing else at the same time. If you put in down to do something and the screen locks you have to watch another ad. If you switch to another app like to download some new music you have to watch another ad every freaking time. I refuse to pay the amount they want to subscribe and having had to watch up to 18 ads to complete one puzzle is absolutely ridiculous.', ""I like this app. As it passes the time for me. However lately, continuous freezing in the middle of a puzzle. What used to take me 30mins to do a puzzle now can take upwards of 2 hours. I've uninstalled/reinstalled, cleared cache and nothing works. I am becoming really uninterested in this app. Please fix ASAP for update to 5 stars!!"", 'Congrats to the MJP team. Moved the game from Flash last year and implemented a terrific update in February 2020. Love the new home page. Also, as someone with about 186 collections, having completed collections in a separate section but still available is an excellent function added to an already super game.💕', ""Once you get into a puzzle it is relaxing and fun. There are too many selections to select to play a FREE puzzle. I don't mind the adds but all the other stuff deters me for going back. I want a relaxing mindless game. 6 mission to open, then 5 other options not to mention the envelope, chest, and coins up top."", 'Since the last update, now the app kicks me off of it. Plz fix the bugs on the app or I will have to delete it from my phone and find another puzzle app. Not happy with the game any longer. I can only do about 10 pieces b4 it kicks me off. FIX IT!!!!', ""Love the puzzles, they are so relaxing and therapeutic, and you don't have to worry about losing any pieces, and it's suitable for all ages. Try it and see for yourself. These a free puzzle every day so there's no reason to not trying it, you'll be hooked before you know it. Enjoy"", ""The app has become jerky and slow to respond when you choose a piece to move, it takes me twice the time to finish a puzzle very frustrating, 2/12/20, this app is jerky again !, it's very frustrating to play, rebooting doesn't help, please fix. I have the latest version"", ""I enjoy doing the puzzles but especially my own. I thought it would be a fun way to make puzzles from my own pictures especially to share with my grandkids. I've figured out how to upload my pictures. Now I just need to figure out how to share them with my Facebook friends."", 'Do not upgrade!!! If you paid for no ads you will now get ads and commercials! My app now crashess every 8 to 10 minutes. It also lags big time. Ive had this app for about 5 years. This really stinks that i cant use it.', 'I use an Android app from play store. I love this puzzle game! The pieces fit & connect like a box puzzle game only better! I like that I can rotate puzzle pieces, choose bkgrnd colors, pick more puzzle pieces using the magnify glass! Plus Rewards!! ❤', ""I think puzzles are relaxing and calming, and after you're finished you have a pretty picture. They're easy to do and there are a lot of different puzzle packs to choose from. I like to do a variety of puzzles."", 'When I open the app, it shows the puzzle but then it goes to an ad and then blank screen and there is no way to get to the puzzle. There is no X to close out the blank screen. It is happening a lot.', 'As of today i am so disappointed as every time i try to open magic puzzles i get a message:. Magic puzzles has stopped?? I have been playing for a number of years, every day and i really miss this!', 'I had to deleat and reinstall the game after almost 9 months of playing it. The old game memory went to my internal storage instead of the external storage. It got to the point I could not download anymore puzzles. This new version looks better.', 'This was a 5 til they updated it- they used to have daily puzzles where it was a mystery as to what the puzzle picture actually was and it was fun trying to figure out what it was a picture of there were also puzzles where you could see the picture so you had a choice of having a mystery puzzle or a regular puzzle now even the daily puzzles show the finished picture and it kind of takes the fun away of trying to guess wish they had kept the old version', ""I love this game. But I have been unable to open the daily puzzles since:ř February 1. Can you please do something? The page keeps loading with the spinning circle. After 15 min still not successful and same spinning circle arrow. Reboot didn't work. :("", 'Cool pictures, very colorful but kind of hard to see the pieces when you try to place them on the board as they overlap. Would be great if the had a diffetent color lining around the border until put where they belong. Love the pics.', 'Good Zimad just missing the timer so you can see how long it takes you to complete the puzzle flip clock style so can u add that please and thank you and the jukebox we need it back and a tutorial for when you reinstall the app it will start you from the beginning', ""Once you start a puzzle, there's no way to compare what you've done to the finished picture. So there's no way to figure about where a piece belongs once you start."", ""This puzzle app is perfect for exercising your brain. Yes, it's mostly meant for youth, but it still is quite stimulating, no matter your age."", 'Very relaxing and easy to use. Always new puzzles to do. Only thing I would like to see is more different and random shapes to the pieces.', ""Worst puzzle game way too many commercials, put three pieces down four commercials, let your screen go black and more commercials, wanted to check on something else and come back more commercials, can barley play this game it's flooded with COMMERCIALS"", 'Love the game, but I paid a while ago to remove ads and they came back. They pop up in the middle of a puzzle and gets annoying.', 'I really enjoy the puzzles and this game. I would like the option to purchase outright again, instead of a recurring charge.', 'Needs more puzzles. But very relaxing. Id give it a five star if it has more free puzzles. Done just about all of them in 3 days.', 'The puzzles are very relaxing and addictive. The pictures are great. Way too many ads that you need to watch takes some of the fun away.', 'This is my favorite game for years. So many choices! Puzzles are so challenging! Thanks to developers, game goes smoothly. I just sorry it is so difficult to post photos...', ""I've been playing for a while. My game keeps crashing. I uninstalled and then reinstalled. I lost everything and now the game crashes about every 5 minutes."", 'I really like the daily challenges. With the various degrees of difficulty, you choose how complicated the puzzle will be.', 'The puzzles are good but entirely to many ads. You have to watch an ad before every puzzle. I will delete this one.', 'Much improved. Not having the slow activity and not getting stuck on ads that could not be completed. Love the scenery puzzles best of all!']"

It's very entertaining and keeps your focus on many aspects and possibilities of solving besides the 3-way connect. 6 or 7-way groupings produce a fantastic amount of point gains, but do not necessarily determine successes in solving."", ""I've been playing this game for like 7 years... beside tha random glitches. I love it... but every 3 out of 4 levels is clearing waffle cones... its getting old... btw I'm on level 3475..."", ""I am almost to level 3000 so I have obviously been playing this a long time. only trouble is they don't give you any freebies when you get up high. Now on level 3338. Keeps saying to update but it will not let me. So I took the game off and tried to download new version. Will not download and I lost a game I have been playing forever!"", ""The graphics are very good but they could be immersive if the game had an option of setting the graphic mode to various high definition resolution. The cookies with chocolate layer make the visuals lesser vibrant. The music is excellent and it's very soothing. The animals jump on the cookies which is a repusilve act of help as cookies are not meant for such purpose. If the colour of virtual cat was white or any other suitable light colour then they would have had an attractive appearance."", ""I do enjoy this game. I am nowhere near the end of the end if the game to have to update for 20 more levels that i clearly don't need rn. It offers a free reward to update but that's not worth it to me.. to take up more space on my phone for levels I don't need. Lowered the rating bc I'm not able to play unless updated UGH! Edit. Once again I had to update the game to play just to add more levels I'm nowhere near. THAT IS THE ISSUE! 🤦Self explanatory!"", 'fun game but getting very annoying. Im getting a little tired of the fact that I will move a piece One Direction and it goes in the opposite direction half the time making me lose the round. if this is all a scheme to get people to buy extra moves it is not working with me I will just uninstall the game and find another one. Update: with the new update game has been freezing up making me loose a turn because i have to restart', 'This game is ALOT of fun. Best part is there are no ads. I got up to lvl 28 in an hour, and it has an okay reward system. After a time is will feel like the game forcing a purchase on the player in order to progress on harder levels. There is no explanation for things that can be purchased with in-game tickets.', ""If you like Match 3, this one is perfectly serviceable. They all start to look alike, and this one won't stand out from the 900 others on the Google Play store. Everything works smoothly, and I haven't come across any bugs so far. The only thing I'd request of it and all games is to stop the constant Facebook nags. I don't have an account, and many more left the site for privacy issues in recent years but I see that nag screen after almost every level."", 'My least favorite in the series for several reasons. It barely gives away any rewards. The levels are very difficult which is ok... But it often matches your cookie the wrong direction especially when youve finally set up for a bomb. It seems to do this on purpose so player will be forced to purchase bombs and what not. On the plus side you get many many lives.', ""It was a lot of fun till the last update. As it gets more difficult, it's also harder to get booters because the spin is so limited. Then with fewer boosters available, the offer of more moves if we use them is frustrating. This is supposed to be fun, not work. I'm pretty close to uninstalling this game, but I'll decide after this latest update."", ""I love this game but every time I use coins to get 5 more moves in a level, the game freezes, I can't make my five moves, and I have to get out of the app and go back in again, where of course I've lost my level and my coins 😠 Update: previous problem seems to be fixed now, thank goodness!"", ""This annoyed me enough to write my very first review ever! Was offered 182 premium cash for another game if I beat level 100; spent weeks doing so and never recieved anything. Contacted customer support and they told me I was ineligible despite providing multiple screenshots. Definitely would have kept the game as it's good for killing time and mildly challenging depending on your skill level. But after they treated me like this? No. Better off getting a game that isn't from Tapjoy..."", ""This was a good game, I'm on level 3635, but now they dont give any extras on the daily wheel spin to get helpful items, it's mostly tickets and they have gone up on the points to get stuff and down on the time to have them. I liked it better when you didnt have to buy stuff with tickets all the time. Very disappointed. They just want you to actually buy stuff. I'm thinking about quitting the game, even though I have been playing it for a couple years."", ""Was great but this latest update just stops the game from progressing yet it won't update. I have tried many times but it just spins now and blocks the game. 5 bars of service doesn't help. Restart doesn't help. I will have to uninstall and move on to a different game. Too bad, so sad but done."", 'This game was good in the beginning but not so much now. You dont receive your free hours of play or other bonuses. Sent numerous emails about the issues and none of the issues have been solved.

I'm thinking about quitting the game, even though I have been playing it for a couple years"", 'All coins and inventories have gone missing after logged in with new device. Communicated with the support and they just procrastinate by giving excuses and requesting same screenshots to fix it. I am quitting the game although i have reached level 5654. Lousy support. If there is 0 star rating, i will definitely rate them.', ""Love this game it's great. The only negative thing that has happened, is when I'm just 1 or 2 moves from finishing the level, and need to purchase coins and after the transaction goes through, I lose the game. I have to start over. It's frustrating to say the less. I should have tried to get ahold of support, but I'm very lazy when it comes to dealing with things like this. Also the amount of money I spent wasn't much, just enough to get what I needed to finish and win. Only game I play.🦉"", 'Well , its very Challenging !!! Ive had Problems with the Boosters not Appearing when you Click them in your Chosen game. Like...Cookie Walk. When you get to the Third Walk, the Game takes over. But i always go back for more. I cant wait to OPEN this Updated Game.', 'I\'ve always liked this game. It was better before the addition of the pets, though. They seem to just exist so people will buy stuff for them. Dogs don\'t even make sense in a game about baking! I find mine very annoying and actually makes the game lag when he ""charges"". Can the pets be turned off? If not, can this option please be added?', ""Game used to be fun, now it's all about buying boosters that give you half the time it used to. Game cheats frequently in order to pressure you into buying the win. Whoever is in charge of development really doesn't want anyone playing this game anymore. Getting way too greedy and just taking all the joy out of it. Very disappointing."", ""I'm trying not to be too hard on my review as I have been playing for years with no issues. However since the beginning of January I have had issues. I have not seen one pet token fall in a full month now. I would like to be able to receive some of the new pet clothing. Please fix this soon."", ""The game continues to block you from winning until a set number of games, so there's no need to waste your money to purchase anything. Games that are 100% skilled based and not computer controlled is more likely to get a purchase or two. Very addictive game though."", 'Levels are normally rigged harder than they normally would have been (even unmarked levels can be more difficult than ""Hard"" or ""Extreme"" levels). Not raising my rating until I get back the large number of boosters and coins that I had on previous devices/the feature of transferring boosters/coins to new devices gets added (All of those will never happen). Too many other problems to mention. The biggest one is can\'t win coins anymore other than from the spinner which is ultra rare.', ""It's fun but the bottom is cut off and I can't minimize the game to see the boosters. When the pet charges I can't see it. ETA: well, thank you Jam City, it wasn't as easy to disable notch as you stated but I am now able to see the whole game. Thank you!!"", 'Have enjoyed the game until a few days ago. When I run out of plays sometimes you get a free play. Watch the add then you get nothing. Game over. Also now at beginning of the game you sometimes get free items. Again watch ad and get nothing.', ""This game is addicting but the further I get up on the levels the more it kicks me off very frustrating getting ready to delete the App. If it keeps up...I get to where I'm about ready to win a level and Bam kicks me off...had enough"", ""This game is rediculasly hard. It starts at level 16, and it took me 2 days to beat that but level 17 is even harder! This game would be way better if it wasn't as hard and actually beat-able. I don't recomend this game EVER!!!!!!"", 'I am on #974 and there is nothing that tells me how to get to the items that they say i can use to help me. I have tryed every thing i can think of doing but i am unable to access the boosters. They say you cam use multable ones and i can not get even one. You need to fix that', 'Silly & frustrating, not what a game app should be! Get to certain level then Hard/Extreme levels come too close together. I know higher levels are more challenging but some are near unwinnable w/o multiple tries & using helpers (which you can barely get now since developer inexplicably put mostly tickets in spin as *ahem* prizes!) Inconsistent, haphazard chances to get 5 moves for watching a vid, & free spin used to be daily but now is rare. used to be fun, not so much now! Forever to load, too', ""I would give this a minus rating if I could. Not only is it boring but the developers falsely lure you by offering rewards in other games, leading to you wasting hours of your life playing the garbage to be told you're not eligible for no reason whatsoever, they got their dishonest download, they don't care."", 'Every since I updated this app a couple of days ago it keeps freezing and I am unable to play. I am not sure what the issue is but I really like this game and am not happy to be having issues that were not present before updating.', ""Started out good when I got up to very high levels the game itself gave me problems so I'm losing my patience with this game it used to be the only game I look play now is like the last game that I will play because all the problem I have with the game"", 'Used to be better: interval for Prize Spinner used to be 18hrs (now 22); number of tickets required to redeem for prize has increased dramatically; and the constant interruptions to buy, buy, buy are annoying and overreaching.', 'This game used to be fun, but it sux now. You rarely get a chance to get any of the mittens, roller pin, etc. anymore...the spinner prizes suck! That\'s why I stopped playing it....then the events are just ""time"" to PLAY longer? No prizes....then you spend money to get thru the cake walk, etc. Only to get MORE TIME? Really? No basket full of goodies anymore? #Uninstall', ""As the game opens to the first level it tells you to match three and locks there. We've went off, reloaded it several times with the same results.

I had the same thing happen when I first started playing and was going from level 49 to 50...it rolled all the way back to 1 even though I had logged in everyday...more boooooo!!!. Otherwise I absolutely love the challenge of this game.', 'I do enjoy this game but some of the words are truly unusual or arcane and how many times in the fill in the word games does yellow have to be the answer?', ""It's a good game but she glitches need to be addressed. On many occasions I'll be in the middle of spelling a word and before I finish it, it takes just the first part of the word before letting u finish spelling. I was trying to spell wagons but as soon as i hit the t. It took it. I've tried to do Ireland and it took the ire before I could finish. I dont lift my finger or anything. So for now I'm so pissed I'm uninstalling for now. I hate feeling cheated. I'll try again someday."", ""I love this game. I do get frustrated when the game gets ridiculously hard. I am in the higher levels and it is like you make a game you can't win until the computer feels sorry for you after three or more days of trying to win. I have just about quit playing quite a few times because of this. The cheese plates and spread the cheese are the worst and my least favorite."", 'AlphaBetty Saga is not only fun to play but it is challenging and really helps to keep my brain cells working. The game play helps to improve cognitive function and spelling while allowing you to challenge yourself against other players, who I might add are very good at this game. This game is a must-play for any word game aficionado.', ""I love this app. it's all about finding words in the letters given. at first it's easy but it becomes harder real fast. What i don't like is once they decide you're done, they end the session. I want to get 3 stars which is hard to do if they stop you too soon."", ""I like word games and this one is very challenging and fun and most if the time difficult but that's why I like it..but i have completed almost 300 levels and not once did i get a reward, prize nothing for my returns."", ""I love this game very much because it enhances vocabulary, is fun, and easy all at the same time.

But...the word rounds are extremely difficult sometimes. If you have a educational limitations then trying to find 7 letter words is hard. Also, you ask for too much money for bars.', 'Good blend of word making and puzzle solving. Decent dictionary, too.', 'Brilliant word game. One of the best. Well done. It would be more fun if bonuses were given for gold bars rather than having to buy them. I realise you need to make money but on the odd occasion it would be a nice incentive! Still think it is one of the best word games!', 'There are not many differences among the levels. Candy Saga or Sida saga are more fun.', 'I like the challenge of the game and that each screen is more difficult than the last for the most part. The only thing that makes me batty is they will lone up ALL the letters you need for a long word....except ONE.', 'This game is very good exercise for your brain with having to constantly think of words that test your spelling with adding challenging objectives to complete too. Any game that helps get your brain get sharper is a great game and everyone should play games like this.', 'Sadly, this last update does not add up all the lighted letters, after I complete each game. Meaning, I am cheated out of points I should\'ve recieved. Why have an ""Update"", to this game, when there was nothing wrong? I would give you ""Zero Stars"", if I could. I only play this and another game, & you ruined the challenge to try & score 3 Stars each time, because now it is impossible, without the points that should\'ve been counted You have cheated us points, that we should\'ve. received Thank you', 'I am encountering words I have never seen before and having words rejected that are frequently used daily. Seems peculiar! Would appreciate the rules and options available to play the game. That would enhance my experience. XXXX Ditto!', 'Great game. Gets much more difficult the further you go.

I'm almost in the 300s and have won nothing."", 'Takes a long time to get to the really challenging levels, but very much worth it. Could be a better GUI for selecting mouse bonus helpers.', 'It can be really challenging. Difficult at times. Tests your mind. My kind of game! No crashes. No issues, except for my brain. Lol Good game. Highly recommended', 'Love this game, only problem is I play every day for the last few years (yes, I am Boring) and it drops my days played- needs to be on a 24 hour game play time! Love it, keeps my mind active!!!🤗', 'I think its a great game to play when ur alittle board or you just want to relax but its very easy + no mattter how far you get level wise it doesnt get any harder or test you much. Its for very young kids. Not a game for adults really unless you have learning difficultys.', 'love the challenges, but need ways to earn helps. as far as I can tell they must be bought. anyone know how to get them just by playing, let me know. It does get difficult, but when you beat a harder level WOW if feels good.', 'This is a great game. It really makes you think. But what is best is I can take my time and not feel pressured. So many other games create a sort of anxiety because of the timed factor.', ""It's fun! Moves right along.....and so Far lets me move on without getting stuck forever. Okay... I'm getting stuck now and then...,..but can't quit trying....over and over!!!! I think I'm hooked!

Rewards should be better, especially when completing a difficult game. Thats why I rated this app a 4.', 'My favorite word game, never boring because it switches the challenges around every few puzzles so you never know what you will be doing on the next puzzle .', 'I have been playing years now, and have been quiet content with it... Until now. I notice that the free scramble /shuffle is now gone! You have to purchase it and I am not interest at all!', ""Fast-paced, yet fairly engaging. Not as difficult as I prefer but hopefully as I advance through levels the challenge will increase. I'm entertained."", ""It let's you go so far, then freezes, and you can't play any more levels. I could only play to level 64. It seems you corrected the problem."", 'Very very enjoyable. Excellent one. Like to play more.', 'Alpha betty is a game that comparing with the rest if i were its truely beneficial to the mind as it challenges you to not only break your own records, from time to time, but mentally keep you conditioned and mentally active...', 'Great game but wish more levels were introduced. I reached 920 a year ago and am still waiting to progress.! Other than that Alphabetty is a fantastic word/puzzle game if you like being challenged.', ""Lots of fun to play!

It takes a lot of time considering the goals and whether neighbors are playing or not. 40 wrenches and 40 bolts for one oven. That's a little much.

Would be good if expanding didnt require so many coins as not everyone is spending money to advance through levels. Also when looking through gifts to send people it would be better if they were just filtered by food and non food as aside from the dinner tab all my other food gifts have to be searched for amongst lots of miscellaneous gifts. Otherwise really enjoy it!', 'Honestly, this game was just as disappointing as the last one. I love the mechanics, but it is basically a rip off of the original Facebook game.

I use to play all the time. I recently added back Restaurant Story and just now deleted it. I cant get into my gifts, cant watch videos to earn free gems, it keeps freezing up and you cant see anything you type. Very disappointed and i sent a message about a week ago pointing all that out and its still the same. So until it's fixed, I just deleted it and maybe check back in a few weeks."", ""I don't know what's happened to this game.

I lost 100 gems from something popping up on my screen when I was clicking and of course I didn't even get an actual reply. And a lot of these reviews say the same things and nothing has changed. Edit: Every option that is on the customer ticket will get automatically closed out with a 'we don't answer questions pertaining to that topic'. Awful"", ""This game requires too much attention for one where leveling up or earning money takes ages. With no notifications for when your food is ready or counters are empty, it's easy to fall behind as well. Only had it for a few hours. Good game if you have no other hobbies or obligations, or are very, very, VERY patient."", ""I like this game, not love. My food keeps getting rotten! Customers keep getting angry! I uninstall this, because I know some of my other games were cooler. But I don't mind if my sister wants to remove me from the neighbor. I don't play it anymore. Goals are a bit hard. Not too hard.

Slow but worth it climbing the levels after a while."", ""Not sure what is going on but the game needs work. The free gems if you watch ads stopped working with no prior notice. This happened suspiciously right before they announced a big game item sale that will require gems. Also it will be virtually impossible to complete goals without gems.

Previously they ignored members complaints about a glitch that would freeze and shut down the game and would result in accidental gem purchases the users couldn't see."", ""I've lost so many gems due to pop ups.

Its really a great game just really crappy support!! If they would fix this issue i would give this game 5 stars but til then only 1!!!', ""I love this game. I've been playing just over 10 years. The customers that visit our restaurant to purchase our food need to be slowed down. They clear counters quickly and I remember when I first started to play, it was easier to maintain food. But other than that, I love it."", ""Absolutely love this game used to play it then I lost my account then started to play again on my new account I buy diamonds all the time to get through the game faster but for some reason the videos will not work anymore to make things go faster which really sucks could you guys fix that into many parts are required nowadays you're making the game suck one of my favorite games please fix it Restaurant Story"", 'While a fun game, it appears to be in maintenance mode and has reached EOL (End of life).

You get to cook awesome meals and design your restaraunt however you want. The only downside is when you spent a while cooking a meal for then it to go moldy, oh and also it won't let me watch ads for gems?"", 'Does anyone know how to tell or edit whether or not the game is saved to your phone versus the cloud?

And I'm becoming more and more frustrated with the game! I was just playing the game with a VIPi wait 15 hours to use. The game lagged, then went black now that VIP is lost to me. How is it that I can't recover my unused VIP but the game can register that it took groceries to not be able to even play the level. Also the gold collection is very unrealistic to the progression of the game. Everything cost gold"", 'To be honest, I loved the old version of Cooking Dash. Way more easy going and doesnt try to suck money out of your pockets. This version is fun, but however, the gold, VIP passes and even the coins are fairly hard to come by, and you either need to buy those items with real money to continue (sometimes you actually have to) or be super patient and wait up to a week or more, playing everyday in order to get more gold and levels. I do like the game though.', ""Game crashes randomly and costs me points. I'd have to begin the level again but my points have already been deducted from the previous one. It uses a lot of data that it takes too long to load special levels. There's also a lot of pop ups promoting their spinning wheel and whatnot, when you open the app. It's frustrating and not very rewarding in the end."", ""I like the game but for some reason it's saying that I need to check my internet connectivity. I know my internet is working.. so for the past few days I haven't been able to play.. I'll give it a week if it's still not working im going to have to delete the game. which makes me very sad. Here I am in 2020 with the same issue from 2018. Clearly there's a problem with the game. I guess I'm going to have to delete it.. AGAIN"", ""i enjoy this game but ive run into a serious problem which upsets me because i think this game is really fun!! there's a specific mission that's been bugging out which is completing table steaks and you have to get four out of five stars in every level to get to the finale. i've gotten four out of five stars in EVERY level in table steaks except for one, and when i try to play that specific one to get at least four stars, the game crashes, but still uses 10 of my food / resources."", 'I was a fan of the original Diner Dash so I tried many ""Cooking"" games but unfortunately this is far from the best. While this has a similar gameplay, it\'s way too much of a money bait. Gold is waaaay too hard to get without spending that you\'ll come to a point when you almost cannot upgrade anything unless you spend cash. You can watch certain number of ads for free gold but sometimes the ads will bug and I will not get gold. Game too greedy.

The first day I played the game it ran perfectly, however after that I would open the game and it would be extremely laggy. I'm talking freezing, crashing, getting under a frame per second.

Everytime I fix dishes and come back to check on them one or two of them are always missing!?!"", ""I don't like the fact that, you have to wait for the shelf to refill and wait for the food to cook as well. Then u have to go to 5 different stores to cook 1 meal plus you have to build those stores as well.

I even tried to install this game on my other device but still, the same hang and crash happens.', 'Love the game but just like bakery story 2 its a done deal for me because you have to wait for players to generate what you need like omg here we go again wit the generating indigredients smh that was stupid too put it in here once again and why does it take all day for the store indigredients like gtfo with that mess. They rigged this game for u too spend real money. I am good i am unistalling now', 'Good concept just really glitchy, unable to play because of the glitches.', 'It\'s a cool game with lots of features, but has many issues and just bad mechanics. Laggy at times and ingredients disappear after collecting them. Overall, so much can be better. A lot of work goes into completing cruises so the 2000 gem value is misleading. You get 1 gem per the theme dish being finished... not very timely. It also makes 0 sense to me as to why there is no ""sell back extra ingredients"" feature...', ""i'm enjoying this game, i played the 1st one for quite a while and got a nice looking restaurant. my only issue is the lag when you load the game, have to close and re open a couple of times to solve it. Also the reward for the first Mastery recipe is not worth the work or even what you get for what it costs. 2 eggs, 2 bread, 2 Chicken & 2 potatoes. potatoes are a 4hr replen and the recipe takes 1hr to cook & the cash output isn't great. so honestly don't think it is worth the effort to unlock."", 'After all the hardwork I put into it now it will not even start.

Have the dev ever heard or played Restaurant City by Playfish back in the days? The game was shutted down. Im not suggesting for this game to copy what rc was, but to take consider the elements implied with the game such as: 1. Restaurant\'s efficiency and performance rate. 2. Bigger restaurant, way bigger. 3. Varieties of themes for restaurants. (deco)', ""It makes you stop at level 60. There's nothing else to play for. Fun game otherwise"", 'Game stopped working, no support from developers! While the game was fun, all of a sudden at login it kept saying that an internet connection was required. I was already connected. The ""support"" team was contacted 3 times, and I got s blanket response to make sure the app was set for automatic updating, and that limited support was available!', ""I have played this game for years and I have loved it! But for about 6 months there has been a glitch where all of the more expensive food stations are stuck and never finish the meals. This means I can't play it properly at all and I am stuck at where I am now. I have checked on it periodically in case it was temporary and also tried moving the stations but it has still stayed the same. I will be more than happy to update my review once it has been sorted too"", ""Can y'all not make up your mind on how the game is played? In the first one, you unlocked items as you gained experience and food actually spoiled when you didn't serve it. In this game, why would you waste time buying ingredients like reality, but you seemingly can leave the food on the stove without it spoiling. There needs to be consistency. Make this game like the first one in terms of machanics. Kudos to throwing in new foods."", ""this is really fun, but the pop ups at the beginning crash the game sooo much! There is like 4 to 5 pop ups at the beginning that lag a little. I am trying to serve my dishes quick so I don't lose business and the pop ups crash my game!

I am so close to uninstalling for this reason alone."", 'I open the game and I dont even get any quests! This is a bad first impression. I tried connecting to fb, restarting the app, uninstalling and reinstalling. Probably would give 5 stars if I could actually play it :[', 'Horrible! Although the game is really cute and amazing, theres still bad, discouraging loops in it. I installed their advertisement app for a gem reward but it never came to my account after installing and playing ad game they refered. Also the lags and crashes are way too frequent.. My phone does not crash but it hangs even its a flagship one. on the other end, my tablet doesnt lags(mid range only)but it freezes the game thwt i had to cradh and restsrt the game. Pls fix and i will rate 5 star.', 'i love the game but since i switched phones its glitchy and laggy. i have a samsung galaxy S9 plus. i lost so many gems due to lagyness. i push something and takes a while to pop up making me accidentally pushing buy with gems button. its annoying. please fix it. its been like this for months now', ""This is a great game, but a little bit laggy at my Oppo F11, it's really disturbing. Please fix it."", ""Getting construction parts from Cid is killing this game! its a good game but it take way too long to get parts to up grade!

My only niggle is that when tapping too fast the game \nfreezes for a while as it tries to catch up with me.

It's only issue is that it crashes every so often, other than that, perfection."", ""Game crashes on Android 10, which is a shame because I do love this game and the idea of burning everything.
