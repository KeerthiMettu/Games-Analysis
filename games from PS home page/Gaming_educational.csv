Great for learning sorting criteria.', 'Tauught the little one to recognise colours and how they correspond to different items. Soon lacked challenge and she lost interest.', 'My daughter loved it so I tried to buy the full version and it charged my card TWICE but still all games are locked.

Every single game is just a dragging game, but holding the drag that long is kind of a challenge, and also gets boring after a bit.

Not fantastic, not horrible.. mediocre, at best. Update following reply: Developed by experts or not, the cost of the games are rediculously high.

I would have rated it a half star if it was an option, specifically because the freebies are not anything fantastic and the full version beyond the ""demos"" are far too expensive.', ""Is it worth $3.99 maybe not but I got it anyways because it brings so much enjoyment to my 2yo twin boys. I'm amazed at how much they've learned in the last few months. I just wish the other Bimi Boo games were as good as this one. The others just seem more of a reskin of this or don't have as much variety. But that's just my opinion. Would be 5 stars if it were a dollar cheaper or if there was other game as high of quality on there as the train game."", ""One of the few games I don't mind my kids playing - nice variety of puzzles to solve.

Then when it doesn't he thinks he got it wrong."", 'Games are interesting and challening for a childp... visually. There is no verbal repitition, like see a square hear a voice saying square to make connections.

My two year old keeps clicking on that instead of what was paid for and gets frustrated when there is no game to play. So much more to say', 'Amazing toddler game ❤', ""The games are ok but the upgrade is not worth 3.99! The additional games are not as good as the initial ones.

Certainly not worth the price."", ""To the developers. Why did you remove my review? * The full unlock (swipe to the left not right) is considerably cheaper than the cost of unlocking each theme individually. * The lockable themes have EXACTLY the same activities. They only look different. * My 4 year old became bored quickly. Interest doesn't persist beyond a few play throughs. This app may look fine by it is not worth the cost. Unfortunate.

My phone broke. when I got my new phone, it would let me install the app. It would not let me play the locked items after I've already purchased it.

My daughter loves it!!', 'Best app I found for my child. I homeschool my daughter and wanted to find an app that is really engaging and repeats the letter Everytime you touch it. My daughter loves this and is so happy when she is rewarded Everytime she accomplishes a task. I also love the fact when my daughter traces a letter that it still keeps that same shape when it becomes a character. There are ads but, it is worth paying to take out the ads.

From the very beginning of the game you dive into the world of mobile development, where during the game you will get access to the analogues of modern mobile platforms. As in life, the market state is dynamic and constantly changing. New platforms come and old ones go. They just can't withstand the competition.

GAME FEATURES:

▶ 13 cities of the world
▶ The international labor market,
▶ The rich set of goals and objectives
▶ MyOS, Roboid, eyeOS, Doors and more
▶ The global result table
▶ The ability to share a screenshot of the game.

To create a real hit isn't an easy task! You must take into account trends and popularity of platforms. You need to assemble a team of motivated professionals to create a comfortable environment for its employees, and to earn an impeccable reputation.

▶ Conquer the World:

As the game progresses you can move to a new city and country. Each location has its own labor market with its ethnic composition, professional level, and the cost of the employees. In some cities you can meet industry stars. However, as a rule, they are expensive and want a huge salary.

▶ Compete with people around the world:

The game has a global table of results where you can compete within the world in two ways - by the quality of the project and by revenues. The results are available for the day, week, and all time. Also, to date, the game has more than 20 Google Play achievements. Try to open them all!

Everyone decides for themselves as to whether his or her company is to be public or private. However, it seems to us that the country must know it’s heroes!

Don't see what's the point of doing it over and over again. Not worth to spend a single cent on the so called gold and anything they promote to boost your score. Like all of those 'idle' game it's purely design to make you spend money for USELESS addons and make you watch ads without giving back anything meaningful in return. Moreover, their so called 'special events' suck big time, overrun with fakes and bots and they don't give you any time boost after upgrading.

With all the unlocks and progression I had, it was disappointing to have to start over, so I stopped playing. Progression info should really be saved to accounts/cloud based, not stored in local files that gets deleted on uninstall. The below reply from developer is good to know, since games will be saved moving forward, but my game data was still lost since cloud sync was not a thing at the time of uninstall, so my saved games were not backed up.

I have sent a request ticket after visiting the help/faq in the game. I am so disappointed both in myself and the game right now! 😡😣"", 'Good time killer love the references to other things but the only issue that holds it back is the upgrades you can buy for angels arent really worth it though as they arent permenant and the price usually out weighs the benefit for example the 3x profit for 11,111 angels isnt worth it as you get a 2% or higher with gear and cash upgrades per angel i think the best way to correct this other than lowering the prices if to make upgrades bought with angels permenant and carry over agter you reset', ""Changed from 5 star to 3.

Byeee.', ""If you pay money for upgrades in an event, they just up your goal the equal amount to where the upgrade does nothing. Guess they think noone would notice. So, they pretty much rip people off. It's a money making app alright, it is just money making for these crooks."", 'Simplistic idle/tapping game.

I hope the devs can at least add the high framerate option for those who are playing on more capable devices!', ""Half the time I start up the game I can't even get past the loading screen, it just freezes up after 10 seconds.

Controls are superb! Flight characteristics are predictable and amazing in the same breath! Challenging for a serious gamer, simple enough to learn in minutes!!!!!! Real time, fuel, call ahead for aerial refueling! Land at sea on the carrier, resupply your fighter with external fuel tanks, air to air missiles, air to ground missiles and various bombs from hardpoints!!!! Launch from the carrier with afterburners screaming for altitude!!!!', 'I love being able to see all the controls and not having a pilot in 1st person really made me have a wow factor with all the detail i only wish the cockpit throttle and flight stick were dynamic also when trying to take off from the bow of the aircraft carrier i couldnt acheive enough lift to take off but other than that this game lets me fly to my fullest ability and thats what i love about it.', 'Best flight simulator ever. I always get anything these guys design. The controls respond well. The aircraft operate like the real thing. I have the free version on my kindle. I find the cost of the android phone version worth the cost because they have new aircraft available like C-130. If you like aircraft and flying get this ap.', ""The controls are a nightmare!!! The camera zooms in and out and angles around on its own! You can't even look around 360 to see where youre at without it doing some stupid action movie zoom in and out motion! I got a major headache from just playing for several minutes."", ""They've stopped updating. One of the planes I complained about an issue where the aircraft shadows are all over the place and nothing has ever been fixed. They've also stopped updating the game and haven't added new planes in a pretty long time. Unfortunate really."", ""I would give this game 5 stars, but there's one glaring issue. The plan constantly jerks. You can't maintain a constant altitude; you're either ascending or descending. It makes it somewhat difficult trying to refuel in the air during missions."", ""I hope the control system can be more professional,and the sensitivity is too high,it a little hard to control.The night map's light is too dark to see anything,if these problems can be adjustment,it will be a nice flying simulation."", 'This game is fun. But its terribly unrealistic. Fighter jets dont stall at 180 knots. The hornet actually lands on a carrier at about 130-140, and can hold 150 in flight. The lowspeed controls for the hornet and others are terrible. The landing on a carrier is a sudden stop and doesnt seem real. Also, there is no thing that has three levels of radar. Either the enemy sees you, doesnt, or is locked onto your I would pile tho see some RWR sounds implemented, and maybe also combat. Still fun.', ""Really an amazing app. Few bugs are here and there but can't give less than 5 stars for the amazing piece of work and the obviously tremendous effort. Keep up the great work!"", ""Nice game ...but you have to use your own mony to buy a aircraft, and that's the problem why i give 4 star only...but all in all is nice..keep up a good work RORTOS"", 'This game is awesome, it is better than air fighters and made but the same company. It now needs weapons (missiles and guns) and better and more missions, the weapon issue is why I gave it 4 stars.', 'I am constantly doing a search for ""RORTOS"" to see just how they are going to out do themselves once again. When I run across a new flight sim and the RORTOS Team are the creators, I dont read the reviews, look at the screenshots, or try the ""Lite version first. I immediately hit the ""Purchase"" button because I know without a doubt the Quality of the game is through the Roof if it has RORTOS Stamped on the label. Another 5 star rating is their customer service. Thanks Guys for Keeping it REAL.', ""Awesome... If they could have 2 or 3 free planes and locations to start with.. Add in flight refueling... Landing a damaged aircraft... The clouds definitely needs an upgrade. .. Cumulus and Stratos.. Other than that it's the most realistic flight simulator with actual feel of the aircraft in its full simulation including gyro with the device Hopefully there's different feel to the other planes.. It's great but there's still room for improvements"", ""Good flight simulator. Extreme landings is better. Why is everything made by RORTOS have barely any missions unless you get Pro. You shouldn't have to pay loads to get a good game. I saw for extreme landings the pro is £39! What on earth. However, controls good."", 'The game is very good, but can improve, put other commercial airplanes on, free flights and also missions to make it more interesting, put gamepad, great work, congratulations!!', 'Asks for your phone number now? Piss off. Also, the wind is joke in the game. Wind is not digital , on and off.', 'The displays of speed and height should be placed right above the rudder panel. I have crashed many times just because of that. You know that very well if you are flying at low speed you need constantly looking at speed of the aircraft and if you are flying low then you need to monitor height constantly. Infact you need to monitor speed and height both while flying low near stalling speed and to use rudder to maneuver the aircraft. Plz update the app and placed them right above the rudder.', 'Love the game the graphics are good and the confrols are easy to use.', 'Good graphics, however the gameplay is kind of ruined by aweful physics. Primarily refering to the low speed/stall programing. Aircraft dont just drop because theyre going under 180mph. Aircraft will continue gliding. Remember that low speed doesnt necessarily mean no lift. If trailing edge flaps arent supplying enough lift, increasing nose angle DOES add more lift, I get the opposite effect on here. Yall just give the STALL caution at 170 and I drop like a rock, quite unrealistic...', 'Love the game. Some stages are just too dark and can not see the plane or anything else. After i adjusted all my phone settings to their brightest. Perhaps adjust the game gamma a bit brighter for a better rating. Controls are no good. I started disliking this game.', ""One of the best air sim games. Except for the damn adds, Crist I can't even play the game for a few minutes before adds pop up. I understand that we all have to make a living but this is rediculas. I'm deleting the app now."", 'Its cool but my problems are You cannot unlock other planes or scenarios, and the environment is so boring and quiet it also applies to helicopter simulator.', 'Great app, very realistic, taking some time to get the landings sorted, lol', 'Carrier landing\'s are just ""controlled crashing"" and it takes a smooth touch and many hours of training just to get from simulation to actually ""get Jets"" and catch a three wire.....I miss it but, your app is helping me through my retirement and no flight status....lol', 'It is amazing and if you put headphones or earphones on you can get 3D audio too! It also has amazing graphics. Great game', ""Fun game , have to buy too much stuff separately gets expensive I can't even finish the game unless I buy something"", 'Very little of the game is actually free, to many ads for two different landings in one plane.', ""For a free game it's great in teaching some basics about controlled flight."", 'God game OK .Fihgter jet game but you need to pay for every plane at the start you get an f 18 super hornet or sometink like that.', 'I love it! It can be tedious at times, but overall...Hell Yea!', 'Sorry if my previous review was rude... I fixed the issue and this is a great game!!!', ""Not the game for cheaper phones, or tablets. Super laggy. But it's a great game on a device that can handle it."", ""A realistic flight sim. I've been playing this game for a long time and I must say, the gameplay has evolved and improved over the years. Superb graphics, absolutely no frame drop issues! Edit : This game definitely needs more jets! How about the MiG-21 Bison? The HAL Tejas, SAAB Gripen or maybe even the Su T50?"", 'Best realistic jet fighter game RORTOS off tops hands down HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT! Just needs a new update or on the other apps updates... It gets boring after completing the game PLEASE NEW UPDATE!', ""I've operated this sim, it's good. @Rortos should hire me for flight testing :) Sadly don't know how to hook up a controller and play this on my phone but have manged some high scores.. Rortos should make it free for some players and have multi-player too."", ""Calibration not working at all. Maybe its a bug or a developer's non seriousness."", 'Awesome flight Simulator it\'s really realistic, I\'m a real time pilot myself and this is still pretty fun to fly, but what I dont like is that you cant land all over the map I would want to land down by the Canyons beside the river and stuff like that, as soon as you drive of the runway you ""Crash"", and would be nice if you could taxi around the air port...', 'Awesome game with good graphics really recommend to play tjis thus as it is good for simulation game seriously and even good time passing game', ""Please add a bit more for free games.

Game on!","[""Now that I have a tablet, Lumosity is much more fun. I highly recommend playing it on a tablet or iPad, as it's hard to see what you need to on a phone, in particular the game where you try to find the differences in shapes. My favorites are the train game, and the one where you fit the shapes into the pattern. Least favorite is pinball and the pirate ship. It doesn't always allow you to take the path that would make the most sense. Enjoyed my free trial with premium but just can't afford it."", 'Absolutely love this app. They have a free and paid version, and after trialling the free version I really do feel that it is well worth purchasing the full version. There is a huge range of engaging apps designed to help improve areas (such as memory, attention, maths etc), and the wide range means that I am never bored and it is most certainly not repetitive like some aps (plus no annoying ads in-between each game which is a big bonus!). Absolutely love this ap, definitely 5*!', ""I've been playing the Lumosity Brain Training Games for about two years now and I have to be honest with you, I Absolutely Treasure my daily 3 free games. And have without a doubt, noticed a dramatic increase in sharper memory/ quicker responses in cognitive behavior in all areas of my day to day life and in general. It has impacted my personal attitude towards myself immensely in recognizing my abilities that without playing Lumosity, would have gone unnoticed. 👩\u200d🎓"", 'Great app. Been using it for some time now (free version). Some of the games are quite challenging (trains and coffee), but some are quite tedious (fuse clues and pirate passages). Overall good fun and keeps me on my mental toes.', 'Found this app extremely useful for the 1st 3 months. It suddenly seems to be repeating almost exactly the same tests. Guess I should subscribe. I may give up on it now but it was very good for a while.', ""Great way to train the brain!

I really appreciate this so im giving a 5 star rate. 🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂', 'It\'s really great. Progress is very satisfying. But it\'s not without issues. In ""raindrops"" for example it\'s easy to miss the buttons - They\'re so small, and the space in between them doesn\'t exactly help. And in ""word snatchers"" you can\'t type words in quickly - It won\'t recognize some button presses so you\'re forced to write slow, resulting in score loss 😖.', 'The app is good. Feels solid, no problems with it. To bad premium is expensive (and an subscription). Otherwise i would have gotten that. Free app is still entertaining, at least, for now.', ""I love love love this app, the games are fun, and they're actually good mental challenges. Most apps that claim to train your brain will only give you sudoku or crosswords which aren't actually that good for brain training. My one problem with this app is I want to buy the premium version but it's a monthly payment rather than one time! I would even be willing to pay more if it were just once.

If you repeat games you get the same things.', ""I loved it initially but I paid for the premium service and since then very little has changed. Very few new games have been released.

“Elevate comes out ahead” in the battle of the brain training apps.

Wall Street Journal
Compared with other brain games, “I prefer Elevate the most.”

Washington Post
Elevate is a “cognitive pick-me-up” with games that are “good for mental breaks throughout the workday.”

RESEARCH BEHIND ELEVATE

Elevate's brain games are designed in collaboration with experts in education and are based on proven educational techniques. Elevate’s brain training algorithms draw from cognitive research in attention and memory studies to develop a personalized training program for each user.",Sharpen mental skills with 35+ games—Google's Editors' Choice for brain training,"10,000,000+",10000000,4.4704075,324265,101434,0.0,True,USD,True,Varies with device,Varies,Elevate Labs,5218712489829190437,hello@elevateapp.com,http://elevateapp.com,https://elevateapp.com/#/privacy,5218712489829190437,Education,EDUCATION,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/CZ6XpP4sihh0VGkMFRif4FVplpvQnaUw5rujfc-xRz2GHDAa9eRwlsk23qegQEay,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ABZKWf798PaqMkiTC9iSxirnWtERJQhZoohokeTdWq8yRhMQrQxumqPhKIcMp3fqxg2a,Everyone,,,,"Jun 4, 2014",1582571066,Varies with device,"• New content added to Adjective Recall, Agility, Commas, and Memory
• Various bug fixes and improvements throughout the app","[""Fun app. I enjoy the games and feel like I've made some gains in memory and processing speed. However, the ranking system is off and always gives fewer points than I've earned. Once or twice it has even taken points away, immediately after earning them! In addition, syncing points across devices does not seem to work, even after backing up progress. Points earned on my phone seem to vanish on my tablet. For a $40 subscription, this is unacceptable. I would give the app 5 stars if this was fixed."", ""I've been playing this for many months straight for FUN. Not anything else. There are too many instances where some of the score given is dependant on how fast you can manipulate the interface when giving an answer. Sometimes you know the answer right away but it is difficult to enter the answer while you lose points. Other times you don't need to know the answer and can quickly tap the remaining choice for optimal speed score. This app isn't an accurate measurement of your ability. Not worth $"", 'Great app , only used it for 3 days and I am already showing improvement in clarity of speech and in my writing. Doing a session each morning gets the brain working and beats any kind of coffee!', 'Since i bought it I can proudly say that THIS IS THE BEST BRAIN IGNITION application. Not game, but has procedures likewise. Really in a week or two you shall give more recorcefullness than before. Just with the basic, free app model. After a few weeks you really should try PRO model, gives much, much and much more. GoodJob, People, THANKS for monthly subscription, I can buy it now :)', 'Good but could be improved. The math games keep me sharp. Some of the verbal games are annoying though. I think the worst one is ""Memory"". Most of the challenge of that game is finding the letters needed to spell out the obvious answer, like ""natural"" or ""cancel"". These are not words anyone should have trouble remembering. Wish there was a way to raise the difficulty on the vocab based games. Also, the animation after you finish a game is gratuitously slow and the sounds get old.', ""This seems to be the best of these kind of apps (at least, that I've tried). The games are fun and seeing your improvement and rankings is interesting.... but be aware, it's a 7 day free trial and after that costs 40 BUCKS! Which is a pretty insane price point for an app. I don't think I'll pay it and I'd suggest to the developer that very few people would willingly pay it, the ones you're getting are probably mostly being tricked- not cool. It claims there's a free version but I don't see it."", ""I love this app!!! It has helped me immensely to increase my skills and confidence. I feel like I can recall words and synonyms better, and therefore I'm more confident in social situations. I think it improved my Wonderlic score, as well! My one complaint is the Estimations game. No matter how well I do on it, my scores stay in the 25% range. I have no idea why. Otherwise, I love this app, and I play almost every day! Inversion is my favorite game... so fun, with the bubbles!!!"", ""Great app that allows you to learn and get better at basic principles of speaking, spelling, grammar, and math. The only reason I didn't put at 5 stars was due to the fact that they push their pro so much, and that they don't allow as much with their free. It's a tremendous help for everyone, whether you are good or not."", 'I love this app. I broke my old phone and managed to download this app to my new phone and thanks to my Google sign in all my scores were saved. The bad habits you pick up with grammar after school is horrifying. This app irons out all your bad habits, gives tips on how to improve and gradually increases the level of skills based on your scores and achievements on a daily basis. Great way of keeping up to date with key skills.', 'This is my favorite game in the entire app collection of Google and galaxy play stores. I love the idea of progressional unlocking levels/ games is ingenious and the anticipation of being able to see all of the games ,but waiting to be able to unlock them is probably the thing keeping my attention the most. The actual content is mostly challenging and relevant to everyday life with some material that is more advanced, only badges are lacking for the gratification/effort.', ""I have both Elevate and Lumosity and, although the latter is good, Elevate is, in my opinion, far superior. I believe that it has already improved my writing and maths abilities even in the short time I have used it. Also, the dev support is responsive, which is a serious plus. I'm on the free version now (which, even so, has no intrusive adverts), but am definitely considering getting a subscription."", 'Downloaded it hoping it wasn\'t yet another app falsely promising to prevent alzheimers or ""cure"" adhd. I still don\'t know if it is, because it gives you about 2 minutes of playability a day, so I didn\'t spend much time in the app. Otherwise, pay annually for the premium version. There isn\'t even a monthly option. Come on. Every app that does this gets slammed... why don\'t devs ever clue in? Oh, and if you have to make a tutorial for how to ""find"" the free version of your app, maybe don\'t hide it', ""This app is an amazing way I've improved my reading and mental math as well as vocab. I really enjoy using this app, however I am using a laptop and the Elevate does not seem to be very compatible with the computer. I've had some games where I am able to type but I cannot enter the words. This might be the computer I'm using or not, nonetheless it would be great if elevate was made to fit the display of a laptop."", 'Great Brain Trainer. I really enjoy this app. On a daily basis, it allows me to ""shake the cobwebs out of the old brain"" and progress. The training itself is a plus 5, however there is some issue with billing. I paid for the year\'s subscription to ""pro"", however only the free training sessions are available to me. I paid through my Google Play account. According to those records, my subscription is valid, yet the game only allows for the free content. The game itself, 5, billing Is 1. 😔 Update Feb 2020, Everything is now 5+ stars. The billing issue has been resolved and all is well. Thank You for the resolution and this Brain game! :-D', ""Originally I had intended to give this app (3) stars as it does have some good ideas. However, the yearly price is outrageous. This is a $10.00 app AT BEST, not a $40.00 one. Secondly, the time trial mentality is infuriating. You know what I want to do? Improve my comprehension and response time. You know what doesn't do that? Listing a story word by word in a fairly brisk speed and then asking me for specifics. That's not challenging, it's a infuriating. Speed is not comprehension."", ""I use both Evaluate and Lumosity and I think this one is better by far. I don't have a subscription for either so I don't get to enjoy all of the perks, but that is okay. Without the subscription there are still plenty of activities to work though, helpful hints and tips, and also some very nice materials to help you with subjects you have lover scores in. In the future I think I might subscribe to get all of the perks, but it doesnt feel like its required. I would definitely recommend this app."", 'Really enjoying challenging myself with this app. I like how it increases in difficulty as you improve and it tracks your progress. I also like how many different elements there are, focussing on everything from punctuation to spelling and maths. It gives you extra study in the areas you are weakest.', 'Fantastic but still things to improve. There so many good words mentioned but i need to screenshot in most games in order to gather the words used for the day. Every game should have all the words for the day at the end with the definition so when they change the next day it is a new batch. We will reach new depths into the learning process. I would say I have learned only about 5% of the new words I have seen properly and the connotation/sort of meaning of 20-25%. We can improve the quality.', ""I'm definitely being challenged. Purpose served. The format is approachable. I like the compartmentalized format to see accomplishment more readily. Perhaps if an interest survey was had at the beginning then the context of questions would be more enticing supporting momentum for learning wanting more than the allotted daily session. Thank you for this app."", ""I love this app. Since I started using it, I've noticed significant improvement in my writing and verbal communication. Even my math skills improved. It's a really great app. Although sometimes, a game refuses to load for no reason at all and I have to switch to another game. Please try to fix that problem"", 'The game is challenging, but the challenges are clearly defined, exercising narrow areas of skill, and it has shown me clearly areas in my learning where I can improve. I believe that with continued use of this app, those weaknesses will be strengthened. The mechanic of the app is sound and engaging.', ""Overall a good app. As a foreigner, I don't know some of the expression showing in one exercise, so it makes hard to get things right, but it's good that I'm learning them. Also some explanations about the mistakes are not really helpful, maybe there is a need of being more detailed ?"", 'I love the game, I think it really helps me learn and relearn everything as a busy adult. Only downside is paying for all of the games. Without paying you can only play 3 specific games they give you that day. After the day is over you can play the 3 different games they give you.', ""Beating one's last high score definitely becomes addictive. Good content, but wish some sessions weren't timed to go so quickly because you could actually learn something if you weren't being competitive with yourself. Session shut down a handful of times, but overwhelmingly dependable. I feel like my mental math has definitely improved and the writing sessions have improved my ability to be more effective."", 'This is a fantastic app!!! It not only makes learning fun, but it tracks your progress and targets weak areas in your knowledge. The way Elevate plays is just like it is a game, but it then addresses your specific needs and provides tips on how to improve your abilities', ""I really like this app! I've been using the free version for ~2 months now and it's such a quick brain workout (5-10min). The animations and games themselves are user-friendly, but they're tailored to you so each day is slightly challenging (i.e. it doesn't feel like a gimmick). With the free version, you're randomly assigned 3 games each day (which you can replay) and it tracks your scores against others within your age demographic, which is so interesting! I genuinely like this app."", ""Compared to Lumosity and Peak, I find this app to be the best pick. Lumosity is more Game-like in design, Peak is somewhat stuck inbetween, While Elevate actually gives me words and math problems to solve. Personally it feels like it helps more, especially with my spelling, grammar, common phrases, and reading (and processing!!) speeds. Mathematically wise, so far I've been given tasks to calculate percentages, work with fractions, and estimate the sum of prices. Looks better than Peak."", ""Very very good brain Training app. BUT!!! You have one exercise with unit conversion, that would be very good and make me give the remaining 3 stars, IF! The imperial units could be removed. As a European, I've lived with only the metric system and even if I have a vague Idea of what the imperial system is like, I have no ambition to adapt to the 5% of the world population who's stuck with this measurement system. Fix it, by adding a slider or something, and you get three stars extra. ;)"", ""After searching for a while, this is the best brain training app for me. But then, like the majority of people here, I realized it's just a super lame 7-day trial, and insisting debit card and credit card info. I could understand a one time payment of 43 USD, but 43 USD for annual subscription? Screw you. Go to hell."", ""The app is good, but they should be more professional and notify you through the app when your subscription has ended. Came an expected bill of an annual subscription that I forgot to revise it. If you don't consider paying, cancel it right after you do the mandatory subscription to access the trial."", 'A language & math focused all. Elevate, as compared to Lumosity, is more focused on math (estimation, percentages, quick math...etc) & language (vocabulary, punctuation, speed-reading...etc), & lack games on memory & reflexes. The Pro version opens up all the level-appropriate games in the 4 categories Elevate has: Writing, Speaking, Reading, & Math. The user interface is very colorful & animated. A lot of work has been put there to make Elevate look as beautiful as it is as a game/app.', ""It really helped me with my vocabulary, writing, math and fast thinking skills developed. It helps those moments when you don't know the right words to say and how to correct writings. It improves on how fast you think, read and react. It's a good app to help you develop and improve your skills at writing, vocabulary, math and reading skills."", 'There useful and less useful games. My favorites are subtraction, division, extraction, and speed reading. You get helpful tips and instructions, so you can actually use this app to develop these skills. I\'m only on day 8 and I intend to keep at it for the whole yearly plan. I have a fear that the games will not develop hand in hand with my skill level, but we shall see. I wish if when you click on an achievement, it would display ""so many % of players have unlocked this achievement"".', ""Okay hear me out, the app is amazing I love every minute of it. The thing I dont particularly like is the timer, because then I start to panic and pick the wrong answer, also the processing game, do you guys' really need to have the tower collapse after one wrong answer, that's over doing it and it makes me feel bad. You wanna teach me to speed read and I get that, but I can't process information if I'm just zooming by and then get a paragraph question which makes it harder. This is a great app."", ""May be a bit too early to fully develop an opinion of the training's impact on my mental skill sets, but i've been enjoying the games since I started playing 3 days ago. Based on the challenge of the games i've been given, I feel that they've properly evaluated my current skill level, and I look forward to continuing my training!"", 'Recently I started using Elevate and I am loving it. Thanks for all the efforts you put into it the app. I am not good in English so I wanted to improve my reading, listening, speaking and writing skills and I think this is the right platform. One suggestion I have is to add a speaker icon beside any new word we come across in the game. On clicking on it should pronounce the word, so that we can know how to pronounce it.', ""It's $39. But you don't find out until you install, then it's too late, they will charge you. Then it's difficult to stop, you can't just uninstall. My brain is going to be smarter because it's a test to remove, which I haven't been able to yet. . They should be upfront about $39. A year. Honesty is missing."", ""Entered my info to THEN find out that you have to pay 39.99/yr. When I X'd out of it I was then offered the free version with limited game play (3 training sessions per day). But, there are NO ads! (1st EVER app I have came across that has no ads for free version.) You can replay the same sessions to familiarize yourself with them (speed reading 😉😉) but it does not go toward your overall score. This app is fun and engaging and will have you constantly challenging your best scores."", 'Only complaint is that they don\'t foreground the fact that full functionality is locked behind a not insubstantial yearly subscription fee. It\'s also a pretty ""busy"" app, noisy, colourful and animated which might be a plus or a minus depending on you. You can switch the sounds off. Does show the developers know how to hit your dopamine triggers though.', ""It's outstanding and exceptional but of course, makes you pay. Now there is a limited, free way you can ply, and that's nice and all, but as someone who needs this very much but truly cannot afford to pay, it's frustrating and disappointing but I am grateful the the but I do get free, thus the four stars. If you can afford to pay, I'm sure it's five stars.""]"

Actually feel like my brain is getting a workout and it's awesome I can see real results. One problem that started after an update. I can no longer enter in words for the game grow easily. The steps to enter words are: enter on keyboard to make the word, it doesn't show up on screen so I have to do this blindly and pray I entered it right. Then I hit the back arrow, then enter. This process is effecting my score a bit as it takes more time than if I was just able to enter the word."", ""These ads are ridiculous. Every game has an add, nearly every screen has some pop-up. It's incredibly annoying, I wouldn't mind a one time payment to get rid of them, but all they want is a subscription. You're limited to 2 games a day without watching a video, AND you have to watch ads even for those. Edit: I found the one time payment, but it's $60! For an app!? I mean it's decent but not that great."", ""I really enjoyed the idea of this app on the first day. After the first day I was really confused because the game looked like it was only playable if you got some sort of subscription. Just after 3 days I understood that I'm only allowed to play 2 games per day. Which in my oppinion is ridiculous. I also find the life time subscription way to expensive. A 100 euros for a game just so you can play whenever you want is not worth it. I can find other games with a similar way of design for way less"", 'Fabulous app. I really enjoy the games. Worth the subscription. The only downside is that sometimes I get a black screen as it is loading to go to the next workout, and I have to force close the app and then reopen. Some games that i used to dread, i have really improved on, and now look forward to. Thanks for this creation.', 'The app concept is amazing: train your brain in about 15 minutes a day focusing on 6 key catorgies of brain muscle. Day 1 went amazing; the 6 minigames were great and my husband and I could compare scores. Day 2 and I could only play 2 out of 6 mini games for the day because the rest were premium. Looked around the app a bit more and about 98% of everything is behind their subscription. It is beyond ridiculous. Why would I pay for anything that has 15 minutes a day (AT MOST) to offer me!?', 'Wasted my money for this game. Never buy anything from this game. The comparison between your score with other people in this game also doesnt make sense. I played the matching word game. When I insert the word ""raise"" surprisingly the game does not consider it as a word. And sometimes the games intentionally changes it question patern to lower your score. Then suddenly revert back to the original patern. No consistency.', ""It works now and doesn't crash. The game however is p2p. So if you want to experience everything on the app, you have to choose a plan and pay however much you choose. If you're f2p, you have to wait 19 hrs before you can plan again. No ads, nothing. So pretty much nothing you can do, besides wait or pay."", ""Suggestion: Put on the time of the day for the more useful data performance. It would help the user to know when is his/her prime time since cognitive abilities vary troughout the day. Thank you so much for this wonderful app, I've bought the premium version for 1 year and have been using it every day for 2 weeks+. Highly recommended."", 'Does not contain any puzzles similar to those that it advertized. I downloaded the app because I enjoyed the Instagram preview puzzles, yet I was very dissapointed to find out that it is simply a series of hokey speed and memory tests. here I am uninstalling it and leaving a bad review. If you dont feel very confident about your intelligence this may be a good, albeit deveptive and arbirary, metric through which you can find some solace and peace of mind. Otherwise, save yourself the time.', ""The bugs have been fixed and I've downloaded and played. The developer was quick to respond to my negative review and informed reviewers that they were aware and working on the problem. I'll keep my original review below for reference. My first session was really fun and I think Peak was very accurate in measuring my abilities. I hope to improve in the areas where I struggle and build a stronger memory. **ORIGINAL REVIEW** It crashes without loading. I haven't gotten a chance to play yet."", 'The game is very diversified, with several games for every skill. My critique is mostly about how the ""Brain Score"" isn\'t clear. When you play a game, you get a score, which then impacts you\'re Brain Score. For example, you may score 200 points on a game, which may increase your level in that game, but still decrease your Brain Score by a few points. Why? Also, if you compare your score to people of the same age, are you comparing to people who have played as long as you or with everyone?', 'Loving it so far! A couple of issues I have noticed: 1. It wrongfully shows that you have ranked up today, although a day had actually passed and playing the game will result in level up 2. in the Perilous Path game, the grey tiles appear kind of delayed and laggy, leaving less time to see the whole thing (Android 10, Nokia)', 'I can\'t get past my \'Assesments\', I\'ve finished my assesment 3 times, every time I finish it it says ""Well done, you\'ll get your first regular workout tomorrow. See you then!"". But then the next day, guess what? another assesment. I\'ve tried looking around to get out of this loop, but came up empty-handed, I can\'t even buy premium anywhere.', ""Advertisement seems misleading. I saw an ad for this app while playing a different game & it showed brain teasers, which I love. But after installing the app, I couldn't find any brain teasers. Maybe they're locked under Pro features? Or I didn't look hard enough, but I don't feel I should have to look that hard to find what was being shown in the ad."", 'I am agree to some other reviews: only give new player an access to 4 short games make me not attached enough to this app and uninstalling. Totally not patient to wait next day yet not sure will it worth it to spend money for a game I just play for less than 10 minutes. My suggestion is give more free games for new players, or maybe free pro for some first days like what other apps do.', 'I like the stats they provide and comparisons to your age average. However it is extremely abusive with its adds. First, it had you see video adds beyond the 2nd game, then every time you wanted to repeat a game, and now every time a games ends. This made me download other apps from their competition that are considerably less invasive.', ""I want so badly to become pro, but i doubt i ever will. Possibly a great tool with great and helpful games but i guess ill never know. Peak doesn't even give you the chance to fully experience it without paying first. I cannot even complete my daily workout without first commiting money into the app. I know my one review and disdain will ultimately amount to nothing but i dont think i can support a business with such soddy practices."", 'yesterday , there was a survey of the one thing that can be improved in Peak.. I believe that the time.. 2.30 min is not enough. A focus of 2 and half minutes does not improve the overall focus. When time factor is increased, or the option of training your mind for a longer time is permitted.. then i give 5 stars..', 'I love this app! When I play regularlyI feel sharper and quicker when I need to make snap decisions or judgement calls- which is huge in my line of work. The games are pretty fun, too. Peak Premium is harder for me to review positively. I got Peak Premium on a sale where I was offered a lifetime of Peak Premium for a flat rate of $20 or so dollars. I doubt I would have got Premium if I had to pay monthly. Paying $5/mo for a few extra games would be hard to justify.', 'Response to Peaklabs: I understand that, but there are 30+ games and non-Pro users can only access 2. I get the daily notification to do the 6-game workout which is supposed to work on 6 different brain parts. But I can only do 2/6. Free users should at least be able to do the full 6/6 workout. Then PRO gives access to all games anytime.', ""This app is great. Easy to play games to train your brain. It's great to do exercises to improve your ability to become sharper and more focused. The app is so straight forward and easy to use that even people with no experience using technology such as elder people can use it. The reason why it doesn't get the 5 stars from me is because I think the app is asking for payment too early. I think they should allow the daily training to be completed before asking for payment."", 'I have not purchased any Monthly/Annual plans as of yet. I am finding the free games to be good, and I feel they are certainly stimulating my brain. My performance is improving slowly day by day. It would be nice if the games were a little cheaper to subscribe to, but apart from that, everything looks good. There are many games to choose from, and are fun to play...', 'The tests are fun and enjoyable but sadly got to rate it very low since there is nothing do until 24hrs when your next workout comes in. To play any of the games even the ones that you dont need pro to play for you have to OWN pro to play. I understand having games for only pro memebers giving a benifit for doing a monthly subscribe to there game fully understandable but having it were you cant even play any games after your workout I personally find an awful way to produce this game.', ""I do love how it keeps track of everything, but must add that in comparison with neuronation is pretty easy on you and, by the other hand, provides a bit less resources for side development than elevate. To be fair, I'm considering for those comparisons the free version of each app."", 'Games are fun but with the added fact that most of the games besides your first time are locked behind ""pro"" mode makes it to where I dont have fun or use it that often. Games make me think, they are fun, but honestly I can get as much fun from porting Brain Academy on my Ds Lite.', ""3 Stars only just because I'm not able to make a purchase of the pro functions available neither I can use net banking aur my Vodafone billing services this games or I would say this program for improving the brain functioning for the thinking ability is really good at least with the assessments which I've been doing since last two days I would really want to buy this either one time or else 1 year"", ""A lot of ads, but the app tells you when you'll have to watch an ad and going pro to get rid of them is worth it. Grow doesn't work properly on my device, and there a few errors every now and again (e.g. a game doesn't load)."", ""A recent problem with an update, which caused the app to crash and my phone to behave very oddly has been quickly rectified. I am very happy it is working again. The games are varied and good fun to play. Does my brain function any better?

Your NeuroNation Team","[""The app should simply be a payable one from the start, if there is no interest to offer a valid free service. One has to keep on skipping exercises that are premium only, only getting to do zero to very few exercises by session. There is nothing wrong with a service/app to be payable only; it's legit. There is something wrong with an app that just steals time from you when in free mode, though. I might consider paying for it, but now I'm just annoyed and am uninstalling it."", ""Brilliant brain training app. I paid for it to avoid the ads. The exercises can be extremely challenging. I like the fact that you can switch exercises If you aren't brilliant in some. The neuro boosters are very good and help you focus. However, the app loses a star because there are not enough exercises. It seems to be the same ones all the times. In addition, the former performance reports aren't available and can't be compared. But overall app is good!"", ""I already had this app a few years ago and wanted to try it again. Some exercises got worse (e.g. the number adding exercise) and some tasks are completely stupid and I fail to recognize how they should help me. I just completed a session without a single exercise, because they are all for premium... This feels like a rip off. If you are not willing to pay for it, don't even install it."", ""I have found this to be a very good app for focusing on finding shapes, letters & a combination of letters within a short time in differing conditions! I am addicted to brain training exercises because I have a beloved sister who has Alzheimers! She hasn't recognized me for years, doesn't speak, walk, is bedridden! I live in Canada, she is in Florida. I see her 3-4 times a year! Although her mind is lost to me, her body is alive! We are siblings & I love her so much!"", ""I actually want to give this app the full five stars. There appears to be an error or 40 in the system. Seriously. We need to talk. I've not been at it long I'm not surprised my achievements are low. However when I've memorised symbols and then an extra symbol pops up that wasn't there to start with, well I'm not mad even though my memory is bad!"", 'Neuronation Premium says, ""Full personalization according to your wishes...""Is it really so?? I have been a premium subscriber of Neuronation for more than 8 months now and if I want to give more time to a certain exercise in a session, It won\'t let me do that. The time is fixed and you can\'t change that as per your needs. It\'s not helpful.', '🔥🔥💣I had problem with memory, was just too often forgetting some things. Using this app, particularly ""symbolism"" exercise just 2 times per week for 10+ sets in a row, helped me get rid of that. I recommend this app for everyone who currently have problems with memory or for those who just want to improve speed and precise of thinking.', ""Challenging, easy to follow and effective. I have been looking for an application that could aid me with general knowledge, memory and brain training without an immense price tag. I discovered this application on the Editor's Choice tab on the Google Play Store and can say with assurance that I have found the application that I was searching for. I was immediately impressed with the professional, slick layout of the application and the ads are not intrusive at all! I definitely recommend!"", 'This is a thorough training app and the exercises seem to be aimed at development. Once you get the hang of it and fully understand the instructions beforehand, it really does put you to the test. In some cases, the instructions could lead you to think of a different outcome and once you go through the test it becomes apparent later on what was meant in the instruction. As the developers are still working on theses matters I have rated 4 instead of 5 stars for now. Will update once improved.', ""Pros - fun games! I Enjoy! Cons - Not really convinced that this will train the brain. How is this a systematic way to improve the brain? What differentiates it from playing a board game with friends? - Silly stories of daily activities of persons who fail because they haven't trained their brain. Claim: brain training could have helped the person out. I don't see how, I think the claim is badly supported. - too much animations in the games, it should be possible to turn those off."", 'This app seems to be genuinly helpful. There are many excercises which gradually increase in difficulty. It has unqiue challenges which have various details and are fun to play. It isnt generic or simple in any way. They also allow you to use nearly all services by providing ads which can be easily cancelled within 5 seconds and are not annoying in anyway, it just goes to show that they have a genuine interest in improving your weaknesses. However please advertise your PRO features better.', ""Complete disappointment. Immediately after download it had issues. Wouldn't open past the brand screen for 10 minutes. Opening video froze on and off. Took 3 tries of opening and closing the app to get through the test. One of which wasn't completed but gave me a score anyway. I tried attaching to wifi, still retaining same issue. Great concept, total waste. Unsubscribing and uninstalling"", 'Out of the many brain training type games on the market, this one is certainly one of the finest. The graphics are simple in design and do not detract focus from the task at hand. Instructions are clear and concise. The task themselves are challenging and I am pleased that the difficulty levels are matched to ability and increase with progress. I definitely recommend this to everyone! Well done development team 👍🏻💥👍🏻💥👍🏻💥👍🏻💥', ""The app used to be way better. Most of the previously free exercises are now only available in the paid version. Some of the sessions are now composed of paid exercises ONLY, in a way that one cannot develop that specific ability. I'm uninstalling it and looking for a similar app right away!"", ""This app shouldn't be advertised as a free app. In the first two levels, user gets a prompt to watch ads to continue using the app without a paid subscription (which is quite expected considering the value the app gives), but after level 2, all the exercises are premium and can't be accessed without a subscription."", 'So started out good for the first 30 seconds, then they are trying to shove the premium version in my face ever second the screen changes. Who is the genius that let it take over my volume controls. Apps have one download with me, if they suck I wont ever download again. Nice try neuronation! Maybe might I suggest lumosity or elevate, way less spam!! And free!!!', ""It's a really good app! The games are fun and interesting. Too bad I can't pay to play the Premium exercises. But either way, I totally recommed others to try and see if you like this app the same way that I do or if you don't!~"", ""This app is the best 'Brain Trainer' I have used! It's well worth using once a day just to keep your brain fresh, it also helps if you're practicing for psychometric assessments as part of a job interview."", 'Great app. Some of the exercises should have a practice round to ensure understanding so the score doesn\'t count against you. Thanks for making an awesome self improvement app! Frequently the page ""this add helps keep the app free"" doesn\'t load the add.', 'It helps to keep your thought process active. Here by practice, i acquired lot of Efficiency but I am not sure if the acquired Efficiency is transferrable to other dimensions. I can confirm that, it has increased my brain activity at a certain level.', ""So far the games are fun, quick, easy to understand. No upgrad; the aren't that annoying. This IS the first day not sure if they will become more frequent and longer."", ""It's fabulous game. I can't ask for more! It's really helped me to memorise things better. Many thanks for creating this application. Highly recommended to anyone who wants to train and make your brain working effectively."", 'Absolutely love it! Great puzzles, keeps the mind sharp. I also like the way I have control on keeping the difficulty level, increasing it, decreasing it, depending on my progress.', 'Like it so far! I do wish it was free for longer than 7 days, even with the ads, they are less interruptive than other apps! Thanks!', 'Sum things are a little difficult at first just because I feel a little anxious due to the tests being timed but once shown where mistakes were made during the tests it was easier to understand and do it right the next time', ""Nice so far. However, getting tired of being spammed to go premium every 2 mins when I've just started the game. The game also turning your sound on when your phone is on silent is damned irritating."", ""Works nicely but most content is premium. For what I've seen using the unpaid version, I don't think premium would be worth the money."", 'Sometimes the instructions are incomprehensible. I just repeated an answer to get through the test. But the app never asked on this test, whether I understood it.', 'Brilliant app really forces you to thi k, and can increase the difficulty, plus more than three games. Various areas of the brain focused on', 'Great app that gives you a program that can be changed and personalised to your preferences and available time each day to work on what you want to improve in yourself.', ""Great exercises, but a few things missing. Instructions are poor. Sometimes the game freezes. No way to ask for a little more time in certain games, such as figuring out math equations. You almost are done, but you get a 'unfinished' sound and it goes onto the next problem and you cant see the answer. Good app but needs some improvement."", ""Best Memory app! Definitely download, I remembered things I wouldn't usually within a week of playing this game. Tip: repeat the exercises you're bad at until you get better."", 'Absolutely fantastic, I have had visible improvements in day to day activity in just about month. But you need to train every day, no excuses.', 'Ive only tried app a few times but seems to myself to be misleading or not easly undurstood on what the games are asking you to do to complete each task.', 'Great app. It helps you improve your memory skills and fast response.', 'So far seems fun. Im glad for the free option with an ad. I would not pay for it.', 'A great brain challenging app. I would love to go premium but I find it quite expensive.', ""This is not a rating but encountered problem changing the peer age group, which was wrongly selected. Can't seems to go back and change it. Pls assist. Tq"", 'These brain games are very interesting and fun! I enjoy the exercises, while I help myself to think faster.', 'Excellent app. I do believe it has helped me trying to keep sharp, while getting to the 50 yrs mark.']"

Very Clear and easy-to-use interface, enough options and customisations, possibility to add custom puzzles, it even lets you decide how you want to see the ads. Unfortunately, for more hard-core players, such as myself, the puzzles are a bit too much on the easy side but, as I've said, for the casual player it's an ideal app for their spare time."", ""Great sudoku app, easy to use controls. I love that there's a custom option, I usually use that to solve the sudoku in the Sunday paper since the app makes it easier for me to visualize where the numbers should go (and no erasing!). I have just one minor complaint: the game allows you to pencil in a number in a row/column/box where that number already exists."", ""I've been using this app for years! I love that it tells you the quantity of each number that's already on the board. I also like how it highlights the number when you click on one. Also the difficulties are great depending on what mood I'm in/how much I feel like focusing. Easy levels take me around 5 minutes and some expert levels have taken me 45+ minutes. Always my go-to distraction if I'm wanting to unwind after a long day"", 'I was new to the game and had to resort to validate facility but after a few I discovered the method and was able to do it alone, thank you very much for the game. I now do at least one a day, and more if I have time, be addictive. I am still a long way to hard puzzles but I aim to get there eventually.', 'I downloaded this app after perusing a long list of available sudoku games and am very happy with it. The ad bar is a constant minimal presence at the top of the screen. It does not interrupt play or take over your screen w/jarring music and graphics. For that alone I would give it 5 stars. So far, the play has been great. Lots of options on skill levels and I like that there is an option for clearing the board (Reset) or removing just errors. So far, so good! 😘', ""This has been the best free sudoku app i've been able to find. My favourite option is the ability to click on the number first rather than having to first select the cell, then the number. I hope this app works forever. Also, i have had 3 different blackberries (2 old, 1 new) and this app has worked on all of them which i soo appreciate because a lot of apps dont work on the older blackberries. So, thank you!"", 'This is an excellent Sudoku implementation. I have been playing this version for a couple years. It has helped me to grow in the game. It does the best job of assisting without giving the answer away. The pencil function is spot on. The highlighting of the active number opens my eyes to the possibilities. Skip the lame implementations and go with Genina. These guys know what they are doing.', 'The level difficulty changes frequently, apparently at random. It\'s infuriating. ""Extreme"" level puzzles are frequently easier than ""Hard"" or even ""Medium"" puzzles. You can play for weeks on the ""Hard"" level, then all of a sudden the puzzles become more difficult than the ""Extreme"" levels. I hate it. Their programming sucks. I\'ll go back to playing real Sudoku games on paper.', ""A great pass-time for any 3 to 45 minute period. This app has features that help streamline basic sudoku, without removing the challenge. My favorite android version so far, and I've been using this for 4 years."", 'Even though the game is tiny on my cellphone, I enjoy it. Hate being times though, because sometimes things come up and I have to close and come back later, or reset, so there should be an option to play untimed also.', ""Great logic solitaire game that challenges me and is exciting when I can solve difficult puzzles. Sometimes fun to try to blast through an easy one as fast as possible but I don't worry about the time anymore. Just enjoying filling in the boxes! Thanks for a fun game that is good layout for me in portrait format on my phone."", ""It's an easy to use interface that generates endless games. The interface is actually useful to the point that it makes the game too easy. You can finish even the extreme level games very quickly if you make good use of the tools the interface provides"", ""There is a minor flicker that occurs when you enter something in a square, but it's minor, and only the highlight is affected. Noticeable for sure, yet not really disturbing. Ad-wise it's relatively unobtrusive, and as far as I can remember no jumpscare full-page full volume ads."", 'Great UI, very intuitive, fast and easy to use. Puzzle state is easy to see. Ads are unobtrusive, no waiting to play a game. Fantastic free app!', 'Needs an option to create a save point that can be restored. At the extreme level most of the games can be solved in a few minutes with only the simplest tools. Needs more games that are actually challenging.', 'Love this app. Even at the same difficulty level, it switches things up and keeps me on my toes. Best replacement for the time I spend on Instagram.', 'I love this version. But one suggestion...while using the ""pop up"" version, why doesn\'t the pop up appear UNDER the puzzle? There is plenty of room! It would be much more convenient!', 'the sudoku is very simple with only necessary graphics.But on the other hand, it is addictive and once you start playing and winning , it gives you a sense of achievement.The game graphics should be improved due to which i have given 4 stars. #lovesudoku', ""Love it! Best Sudoku app I've used so far. I especially like the custom feature where I can enter in puzzles that I've printed out. Once I've chosen to validate a custom puzzle, it locks it in and I'm ready to solve."", 'I like the control options a lot, however the hardest level (""Extreme""), is not consistently difficult and generally not super hard, as I would hope for.', 'App makes playing the game more fun. Colors and highlights help identify potential moves. App responds quickly to make playing fast and enjoyable. I have played many Suduko apps and this is the one I come back to and enjoy playing.', ""I love sudoku and this is the best version I've ever played. Very user friendly. And you do not need internet connection after the game is installed so it is great for vacation or any place that there's no internet."", ""Excellent controls. Easy to use. Looks good. Sometimes difficulty is inconsistent. Would like more control of the difficulty level. Ads are very discreet. I don't even notice them."", 'Varied levels of difficulty, clear presentation, present but unobtrusive ads which do not detract from the game. This is my favorite Sudoku app.', ""It's all good- the game is what it's supposed to be: sudoku. It's easy to use, games can be paused and resumed, new games started any time and varying levels of difficulty can be selected. And after each game it shows how your time compared with your previous top scores. My only half-complaint is that the different (and changing) color boxes sometimes make it slightly more difficult to see the numbers quickly."", 'I like the call option makes the game faster. I have downloaded about 50 different Sudoku and I always come back to this one.', 'This app was great until I upgraded my phone. Now the app spontaneously opens Amazon product (affiliate?) pages without me having touched the on screen ad. Uninstalling this adware next.', ""The settings and actual app and functionality itself is wonderful, great and easy to use. My complaint is I have this on an apple device and an android device. On the android device I can routinely solve the extreme difficulty puzzles in under 5 minutes. I don't see any difference from medium and hard. On mynaople device the challenging puzzles are actually challenging and I enjoy it. I don't know if that's an operating system, but it's no fun to play anymore when I can solve a puzzle in 3:23"", 'Best user interface: large, easy to read numbers. Good contrast easy to identify supplied vs user answers vs. pencil marks. Controls work as expected and easy to use. Good range of difficulties.', 'This game helps me than anyone could possibly knows. As it helps me to stay focused on solving the puzzle but also I try to get my mind off of many of things. As many of things are too, mathematical and has been changed to alphabetical. That even alphabet letters are also numbers to me. Keep up the great work and keep shooting for the Galaxy that we all want to be apart of.', ""Love the app, works exceptionally well and I've used it for years. But recently discovered the extreme level has become so difficult (from average 10 minutes to average 25 minutes) that mostly can't be resolved without trying a solution and being prepared to backtrack (in other words the next move can't be deducted on the basis of available information) which I'm finding annoying."", 'Simple and easy to use. No distracting animations or annoying popup ads. Maybe the next version could have a few more features for personalization, please?', ""great app. I love playing sudoku on this (23 seconds is my record) but it keeps me calm and helps me when I'm stressed, in or out and about with no entertainment."", ""I've had this app for years. Today there were ads obscuring the bottom row of numbers. One feature I loved about this app was the time tracking. Now, my timing is meaningless because I can't see the numbers and have to try not to get redirected to a different game. The ads are also gaudy and distracting"", 'I really like playing sudoku. Your game was on my tablet whenI first got it. All of a sudden it was missing one day. I could not find it in Google play store. My Amazon rep told me the manufacturer probably pulled it. I kept searching. I finally found it again. This time with ads though.', 'Bin using this for years. Only problem is that the different levels are not uniform. The same level can be easy for a while and then extremely hard. I have', 'Lots of levels of difficulty. Just learned how to play so great for beginners who make lots of mistakes. You are not penalised. Immensely enjoyable', ""Love it. Calms my nerves. I like the way the penciled-in possibilities will light up when you choose a number. Most other Sudokus won't do that."", ""I love Sudoku, and I like that the ads are subtle in this app. The thing I don't like is that it doesn't let me finish. I have most of a block filled in, and I'm just missing one number and I can't fill in that number because it says it's wrong, but it isn't. It'll be the very last possible number in that block, the only number that's missing. And it won't accept it. I'm disappointed."", 'Why do people EVER complain about ads? Do some expect developers to not make money on free games?! Played on kindel/android and while others complain of ads, I can\'t recall the last time an ad appeared. By far my favorite. Unlike every other sudoku I have played, when ""numbers first"" option is selected, highlighting cells is still available. I especially appreciate the larger numbers on the grid. Even with 2020 vision, it makes a difference! I only wish they had the 3 mistake maximum option.']"

Some problems will be surprisingly easy, and some will require an elegant solution. Most levels can be completed in a number of ways (solutions different from suggested ones are also accepted). 
Hints can be accessed by clicking the “Solution” button in the menu.

A Little KenKen History: 

KenKen was developed in 2004 by acclaimed Japanese mathematics educator Tetsuya Miyamoto (no, not two guys named Ken). His goal was to improve his students’ math and logic skills... and what better tool than a puzzle? So he developed one that would be understandable, fun, and challenging for anyone at any level. Most importantly, he wanted the puzzle to encourage independent thinking, emphasizing logic, reasoning, concentration, and perseverance. His puzzles immediately met with unbelievable success and are now played the world over by children, adults and the elderly. Since its invention, KenKen has become the world's fastest growing (and most enjoyable) puzzle and has proven to be one of the world's best brain exercises.

Also, UNDO does not restore all pencil marks as they were before. Finally, when you start the puzzle and choose pencil marks, the top left box gets highlighted even though you choose other boxes. Last year we had the Apple version which worked perfectly. a true ripoff', 'Odd difficulty in selecting squares, but otherwise a solid game.', ""Quick fun. Ideal to fill empty times that are short as they most are these days. Quick enough that the search for the next move is not frustrating. Ads do icrease the level of annoyance but, wih this KenKen, the annoyance level is low. If it would  increase significally, I would have to find another game. After all, the purpose of any game is to have just fun. I like the clear display of choices of grids and levels of difficulty. Altogether I'm quite happy with the diversion this game offers. Plus it's an intelligent game. Makes us think, or at least calculate."", ""This is a great Kenken Ap.

I haven't bought anything."", 'Love the game but it keeps pausing after I pass a board. & takes a while loading the next. I uninstalled it over 6 months for that reason, only to reinstall & still have the same problem. My girlfriend & a couple friends uninstalled it for the same reason... disappointed...', ""Sweet graphics, concept and premise. I like how easy it is, but it doesn't have a YouTube series, and you need to focus on this more, Rovio. I'm not HATING on you guys, I'm just slightly disappointed. Finland, you need to up your game."", ""I love this game but it's getting to the point where I don't want to play because of the length of time it takes game to load, and when you pass a level, the time it takes to get to next level is ridiculous. Please fix these problems"", 'I enjoy playing your game. Unfortunately over the past three months during tournament for bingo or obtaining extra tools to use during play the game freezes and I lose what I have gained during that game. This is very frustrating. Hope you can find a repair for that problem', ""Hey, Rovio - Nibblers Bingo keeps crashing !! Love this game, been playing it for some years now, but like all games - you're penalised if you're not on Facebook (NEVER gonna happen !!) So, I have to play the hard way - no help or boosters. Octos Plunder is IMPOSSIBLE !!"", ""2019.10.10 update - game performance and load times have been more or less back to normal for 2 days now. Game no longer playable. Something like 2 months ago, there was an update. Now the game freezes when you open it. Every time. And it still hasn't been fixed. When people can't use your app, that's a pretty big deal and something you usually try to fix right away. But these developers obviously don't feel the same way."", ""Been playing game for yrs. Sometimes the levels are almost (or are) impossible. After so many times of trying to clear level, game stops being fun and you feel frustrated. In particular level 99. There are others but since I can't reach 3 stars on this one, I will mention this level. Graphics are good and game does not ever freeze up as others do."", ""When are you going to take action and fix the problem with the loading process??? All the users are complaining, but you still do absolutely nothing. What are you going to do when everybody uninstalls the game??? I was playing it for years, but now it is a total flop. Arecyou even reading the reviews? I don't see any answers or apologies."", 'The game itself is really good. However, it loads to the map then...nothing. I wait so long either my phone switches itself off or im asked for feedback. Ive missed out on tournaments and bonuses, which is all part of the game. Completely ruins it. VERY DISAPPOINTED, as i have reported it a zillion times with no affect.', ""Don't download this game ! It's only a wastage of time and money ! The game developers are too much greedy ! It's impossible to clear the 68th level without paying money ! So , it's not a fair game ! Don't spend your precious time and money on this rubbish game ! Prefer other match 3 puzzle games instead of this one !"", ""I'd give it 5 if you can fix the intial login time. Takes about 1-2mins until you can actually select anything, over wifi also. On airplane mode it starts right up. This is on an S7 Active & S9. 9/16 update, still takes forever to start with a internet connection. Can you do all your data snooping in the background to make it start faster?"", 'Some levels do not give enough moves. And some should be three stars. But no matter how may times you play it still Will Not Give You 3 Stars.', 'Love this game.. One of my all time favorite.. EXCEPT for the once in awhile days on end crash! Which I have right now.. Game loads then freezes.. It says last update was Aug 2018!!', 'Love the game, but the game freeze up or just quits working all the time. If not for that problem it would be my favorite game.', 'This games hangs for several minutes, during loading. And also hangs when playing Nibblers Bingo.

This game is so much fun."", 'Nice game. Much better than most of games of this type. But why it should take more than 5 minutes to load it on my high-end phone??! It is ridiculous!', 'This game is fun im on stage 420 but it takes forever to come on and start it freezes or something idk but it sure pisses me off and im hooked up to internet dont makes no difference but ive played for this long made it this far im not the only one aggravated do yall people even read the reviews we wriite if so yall fix the promble we take time type it for yall do yall part ...', ""Can't load the game Can't log into the game says can't connect doesn't matter if i use wifi or data. Other apps work but this one"", ""I love this game! I've been playing for years!!!!! I have marketed this game like its no-ones' business to EVERYONE i know ; my friends, my boyfriend, my friends boyfriends and girlfriends , im a real fan!!!!"", 'great, challenging, very well playable for free. crashes regularly.', 'Ths game is always freezes,need to restart the phone if you want continue play.its so annoying! Can you fix it please!', 'I love this game i havent played it in almost a year but 2020 im determined to get back. Its a cute animation, brain tweazer and overall just fun!', ""it has been nearly 24 hours that I've been stuck on a claim prize page after getting a bingo. I have uninstalled, reinstalled, waited, hoped. this game has been a favorite for wire some time but it's time to give up. I've dealt with the same problems that other reviewers have with waiting 10 minutes for it to load. 2 minute lag between games. glitches after glitches no matter what device I have tried. I'm done"", 'Crashes before I can play 19 times out of 20. Only app on my (nice, updated) phone that has any problems. I once enjoyed this games, but now can hardly ever play it.', ""The game is slow but I'm rating it 5 to see if it helps speed it up. I know it sounds stupid, but it's worth a shot. 😉"", ""I've been playing Nibblers for several years. I enjoy the visuals. I also like the challenges! I love this game!"", 'This app is so fun!

Please fix this or it's getting removed."", ""so far its fun but I just started. Been playing for awhile now an its so much fun. One flaw i see is , I have the friends list but they say I'm not on their lists so I get no help from anyone. I have to wait the time out to play again. It' still the same. I have no one sending lives. To bad I really like this game. still the same complaints and i still really like this game."", ""Recently passed level 230 after 2 weeks of playing. This game is a joy to play. The art style and music is delightful, the gameplay is fun and challenging without being insurmountable. The microtransactions aren't necessary to play the game in any way. I have used none. The ads are not aggressive or numerous. As far as I recall you only see a small ad for Rovio's other game on the title page, or if you want a bonus Nibbler in exchange for 1 ad vid. 5 lives + wait time is annoying, but tolerable."", ""This game was great but it freezes when you first load it and it wont olay for like 10 minutes. Very disappointed, fix and I'll give 5 stars again."", 'I love this game when it works. I have to try multiple times to get it to load before it finally does. Its extremely frustrating.', 'Having trouble playing fruit nibbers because it, doesnt let you into the level you are on.please fix it so i can play. Thank you.', 'Fun and challenging, not to hard to reach new levels', ""I'm only giving this game a 1 star reluctantly because of the loading time to even start the game. I had this game for years on all multiple phones and I'm in the 1000+ levels but its just almost not worth it to keep because it takes forever to load.

My colleague downloaded it and had exactly the same thing. It is a fault with the game not the handsets. We all had 3 different names of phones. I did alter settings and nothing changed. I work in technology so tried that.', 'I like playing the game but I have yet to get the coins when spinning the daily wheel. It seems to either speed up to the next item or slow down before it gets there.', 'I LOVE this game. I play it daily. My favorite part is Cookie Walk. I would give this 5 stars if it would acknowledge my daily use. It has a calendar reward system that gives timed incentives for daily check in. The more days in a row without a break, the longer the time to use the incentive. Today was the fourth time in less than 2 months that on my daily check in it accuses me of not playing the game the previous day. I can pay to keep my streak going. I should not need to pay to keep going.', ""Love this game I've been playing it for 3 years and I'm getting pretty close to level 4,000 . And it's the only game i play and i never leave home with out it no matter what phone I take with me!"", ""Very addictive.........The difficult levels are really challenging and require a bit more concentration to achieve success. THE ONE WORD COMMENT wasn't meant to be derogatory, but at the moment of my input to the review that was the only word that truly described how it had been since I commenced being engaged in playing it. Your graphics could probably be improved, but I have yet attained the ultimate levels, so I can't to see what I can achieve a far as higher levels of play. Sorry if you took my initial description in a derogatory way. It's very entertaining and keeps your focus on many aspects and possibilities of solving besides the 3-way connect. 6 or 7-way groupings produce a fantastic amount of point gains, but do not necessarily determine successes in solving."", ""I've been playing this game for like 7 years... beside tha random glitches. I love it... but every 3 out of 4 levels is clearing waffle cones... its getting old... btw I'm on level 3475..."", ""I am almost to level 3000 so I have obviously been playing this a long time. only trouble is they don't give you any freebies when you get up high. Now on level 3338. Keeps saying to update but it will not let me. So I took the game off and tried to download new version. Will not download and I lost a game I have been playing forever!"", ""The graphics are very good but they could be immersive if the game had an option of setting the graphic mode to various high definition resolution. The cookies with chocolate layer make the visuals lesser vibrant. The music is excellent and it's very soothing. The animals jump on the cookies which is a repusilve act of help as cookies are not meant for such purpose. If the colour of virtual cat was white or any other suitable light colour then they would have had an attractive appearance."", ""I do enjoy this game. I am nowhere near the end of the end if the game to have to update for 20 more levels that i clearly don't need rn. It offers a free reward to update but that's not worth it to me.. to take up more space on my phone for levels I don't need. Lowered the rating bc I'm not able to play unless updated UGH! Edit. Once again I had to update the game to play just to add more levels I'm nowhere near. THAT IS THE ISSUE! 🤦Self explanatory!"", 'fun game but getting very annoying. Im getting a little tired of the fact that I will move a piece One Direction and it goes in the opposite direction half the time making me lose the round. if this is all a scheme to get people to buy extra moves it is not working with me I will just uninstall the game and find another one. Update: with the new update game has been freezing up making me loose a turn because i have to restart', 'This game is ALOT of fun. Best part is there are no ads. I got up to lvl 28 in an hour, and it has an okay reward system. After a time is will feel like the game forcing a purchase on the player in order to progress on harder levels. There is no explanation for things that can be purchased with in-game tickets.', ""If you like Match 3, this one is perfectly serviceable. They all start to look alike, and this one won't stand out from the 900 others on the Google Play store. Everything works smoothly, and I haven't come across any bugs so far. The only thing I'd request of it and all games is to stop the constant Facebook nags. I don't have an account, and many more left the site for privacy issues in recent years but I see that nag screen after almost every level."", 'My least favorite in the series for several reasons. It barely gives away any rewards. The levels are very difficult which is ok... But it often matches your cookie the wrong direction especially when youve finally set up for a bomb. It seems to do this on purpose so player will be forced to purchase bombs and what not. On the plus side you get many many lives.', ""It was a lot of fun till the last update. As it gets more difficult, it's also harder to get booters because the spin is so limited. Then with fewer boosters available, the offer of more moves if we use them is frustrating. This is supposed to be fun, not work. I'm pretty close to uninstalling this game, but I'll decide after this latest update."", ""I love this game but every time I use coins to get 5 more moves in a level, the game freezes, I can't make my five moves, and I have to get out of the app and go back in again, where of course I've lost my level and my coins 😠 Update: previous problem seems to be fixed now, thank goodness!"", ""This annoyed me enough to write my very first review ever! Was offered 182 premium cash for another game if I beat level 100; spent weeks doing so and never recieved anything. Contacted customer support and they told me I was ineligible despite providing multiple screenshots. Definitely would have kept the game as it's good for killing time and mildly challenging depending on your skill level. But after they treated me like this? No. Better off getting a game that isn't from Tapjoy..."", ""This was a good game, I'm on level 3635, but now they dont give any extras on the daily wheel spin to get helpful items, it's mostly tickets and they have gone up on the points to get stuff and down on the time to have them. I liked it better when you didnt have to buy stuff with tickets all the time. Very disappointed. They just want you to actually buy stuff. I'm thinking about quitting the game, even though I have been playing it for a couple years."", ""Was great but this latest update just stops the game from progressing yet it won't update. I have tried many times but it just spins now and blocks the game. 5 bars of service doesn't help. Restart doesn't help. I will have to uninstall and move on to a different game. Too bad, so sad but done."", 'This game was good in the beginning but not so much now. You dont receive your free hours of play or other bonuses. Sent numerous emails about the issues and none of the issues have been solved. Very disappointed as I enjoyed playing the game but not so much any more. ; ( Jan 20, 2020 updated the game but am now unable to play as screen image size has changed. Right sideis off the page so unable to see bosters and bottom of screen is missing. 😞 Why is there always updating issues', ""1 This was a good game, I don't like the updated version, now they dont give any extras on the daily wheel spin to get helpful items, it's mostly tickets and they have gone up on the points to get stuff and down on the time to have them.

I'm thinking about quitting the game, even though I have been playing it for a couple years"", 'All coins and inventories have gone missing after logged in with new device. Communicated with the support and they just procrastinate by giving excuses and requesting same screenshots to fix it. I am quitting the game although i have reached level 5654. Lousy support. If there is 0 star rating, i will definitely rate them.', ""Love this game it's great. The only negative thing that has happened, is when I'm just 1 or 2 moves from finishing the level, and need to purchase coins and after the transaction goes through, I lose the game. I have to start over. It's frustrating to say the less. I should have tried to get ahold of support, but I'm very lazy when it comes to dealing with things like this. Also the amount of money I spent wasn't much, just enough to get what I needed to finish and win. Only game I play.🦉"", 'Well , its very Challenging !!! Ive had Problems with the Boosters not Appearing when you Click them in your Chosen game. Like...Cookie Walk. When you get to the Third Walk, the Game takes over. But i always go back for more. I cant wait to OPEN this Updated Game.', 'I\'ve always liked this game. It was better before the addition of the pets, though. They seem to just exist so people will buy stuff for them. Dogs don\'t even make sense in a game about baking! I find mine very annoying and actually makes the game lag when he ""charges"". Can the pets be turned off? If not, can this option please be added?', ""Game used to be fun, now it's all about buying boosters that give you half the time it used to. Game cheats frequently in order to pressure you into buying the win. Whoever is in charge of development really doesn't want anyone playing this game anymore. Getting way too greedy and just taking all the joy out of it. Very disappointing."", ""I'm trying not to be too hard on my review as I have been playing for years with no issues. However since the beginning of January I have had issues. I have not seen one pet token fall in a full month now. I would like to be able to receive some of the new pet clothing. Please fix this soon."", ""The game continues to block you from winning until a set number of games, so there's no need to waste your money to purchase anything. Games that are 100% skilled based and not computer controlled is more likely to get a purchase or two. Very addictive game though."", 'Levels are normally rigged harder than they normally would have been (even unmarked levels can be more difficult than ""Hard"" or ""Extreme"" levels). Not raising my rating until I get back the large number of boosters and coins that I had on previous devices/the feature of transferring boosters/coins to new devices gets added (All of those will never happen). Too many other problems to mention. The biggest one is can\'t win coins anymore other than from the spinner which is ultra rare.', ""It's fun but the bottom is cut off and I can't minimize the game to see the boosters. When the pet charges I can't see it. ETA: well, thank you Jam City, it wasn't as easy to disable notch as you stated but I am now able to see the whole game. Thank you!!"", 'Have enjoyed the game until a few days ago. When I run out of plays sometimes you get a free play. Watch the add then you get nothing. Game over. Also now at beginning of the game you sometimes get free items. Again watch ad and get nothing.', ""This game is addicting but the further I get up on the levels the more it kicks me off very frustrating getting ready to delete the App. If it keeps up...I get to where I'm about ready to win a level and Bam kicks me off...had enough"", ""This game is rediculasly hard. It starts at level 16, and it took me 2 days to beat that but level 17 is even harder! This game would be way better if it wasn't as hard and actually beat-able. I don't recomend this game EVER!!!!!!"", 'I am on #974 and there is nothing that tells me how to get to the items that they say i can use to help me. I have tryed every thing i can think of doing but i am unable to access the boosters. They say you cam use multable ones and i can not get even one. You need to fix that', 'Silly & frustrating, not what a game app should be! Get to certain level then Hard/Extreme levels come too close together. I know higher levels are more challenging but some are near unwinnable w/o multiple tries & using helpers (which you can barely get now since developer inexplicably put mostly tickets in spin as *ahem* prizes!) Inconsistent, haphazard chances to get 5 moves for watching a vid, & free spin used to be daily but now is rare. used to be fun, not so much now! Forever to load, too', ""I would give this a minus rating if I could. Not only is it boring but the developers falsely lure you by offering rewards in other games, leading to you wasting hours of your life playing the garbage to be told you're not eligible for no reason whatsoever, they got their dishonest download, they don't care."", 'Every since I updated this app a couple of days ago it keeps freezing and I am unable to play. I am not sure what the issue is but I really like this game and am not happy to be having issues that were not present before updating.', ""Started out good when I got up to very high levels the game itself gave me problems so I'm losing my patience with this game it used to be the only game I look play now is like the last game that I will play because all the problem I have with the game"", 'Used to be better: interval for Prize Spinner used to be 18hrs (now 22); number of tickets required to redeem for prize has increased dramatically; and the constant interruptions to buy, buy, buy are annoying and overreaching.', 'This game used to be fun, but it sux now. You rarely get a chance to get any of the mittens, roller pin, etc. anymore...the spinner prizes suck! That\'s why I stopped playing it....then the events are just ""time"" to PLAY longer? No prizes....then you spend money to get thru the cake walk, etc. Only to get MORE TIME? Really? No basket full of goodies anymore? #Uninstall', ""As the game opens to the first level it tells you to match three and locks there. We've went off, reloaded it several times with the same results. We've also tried playing it on and offline for the past several days and have decided it's just a waste of time and storage space.""]"

Ads are intrusive and distracting. Weird irrelevant new features like these little characters you get assigned. Game play is glitchy. I only played 3 rounds since reinstalling and I'm pretty sure at least 2 of the opponents weren't real people. All my previous progress was wiped out from when I used to play before. Ugh. Won't be back."", ""This isn't the game that came out. The game's screwed up with unnecessary features and glitches which closes the app randomly. Not going to complain about the ads because that's what keeps the developers going. But the developers screwed up the app that was simple, elegant and memorable. Now it's just trash with extra features, which is still trash"", ""I played this game when it first came out and I loved it. It's totally different now. You can't complete a full game without spending gems or watching ads. It's so frustrating. I can only answer a few questions before I inevitably get one wrong and am forced to exit because I'm not paying for gems."", ""MY biggest complain is WHY we should give ticket to join an elite tournament. It used to be all about your skill in elite tournament. And it is fair to lose the coin you bet because you will gain twice as much if you win. TO BE FAIR, isn't it logical to get twice the ticket we bet if we win? OR AT THE VERY LEAST, we get the ticket back, in the same amount we bet, IF WE WIN. The added rule to this elite tournament which USED TO BE FAIR to be UNFAIR is just meh"", ""I'm highly disappointed with this game. I used to play quizup earlier and used to love it then but then I had to uninstall it for some reason. I again installed it recently and it has become the worst game ever. I tried multiple times and kept on trying but it kept on showing error and the game did not start even once. Highly disappointed I needed some fun time. I think after these many bad reviews the developer needs to do something about it or may be they don't give a damn now."", 'In addition to this game having become a pale shaddow of what it was in the beggining, it not even works with the latest version. I just log in and a red box appears with ""failed to load config data"". The options are \'try again\' which doen\'t work and \'Quit\'. What a joke. I tried clearing cache and data, reinstall and the same thing. I won\'t miss it given the fact that most of your users have abanoned the game and it\'s mostly bots and ads nowadays the entire app.', 'QuizUp was way better when it didn\'t try to be a social media platform, or have tons of microtranscations for multiple currencies, or have these ""Echelon"" things. I liked how simple the app was. The UI is a mess now. At least the trivia is on point. It would be nice if we could adjust the font size for questions.', ""It used to be a good game until they keep forcing you to open these annoying silver or gold boxes every time you want to play Also they run adverts that block the 'x boxes' forcing you to watch them. It's just really cluttery now Too much clutter. Too many pop ups, boxes to open Keep it simple please. It used to be great. I just want to open my phone and play a quiz without fifty tasks to complete first."", ""I used to play this a few years ago, it was a great app back then! Tried it again (Jan'20) and I couldn't even recognise it! They have massively sold out to advertising, so much that the game is no longer enjoyable. Therefore, I'm sad to say that I have deleted the app in search for something else."", ""A wonderful quiz game. I know how great it was 5 years ago and how many technical issues (and others) there are now. Instead of adding so many ads that cost space,why not ask everybody to pay say 3€? This app is absolutely worth it. I'll gladly support it if the technical glitches will be taken care of. And now these stupid comic figures? Are these supposed to attract 13-year-olds? Believe me,nobody needs these! Instead of wasting time with this nonsense, why not work at the technical issues?"", ""I used to really like this app and played everyday but the new qluzos thingying make the whole game too clunky. I don't like the update. Prefer you to update the questions! Also when are you going to add questions for Season 8 GoT??? Still waiting..... In the past I gave it 5 but not now. No motivation"", ""I've been playing for a while and obviously I'm a quizaholic.... So quiz up is right up my alley! However, there are few things I would like the creators to take note of- when you reach a higher level, it would be nice to have a change in the questions. Some of the questions are extremely repetitive. Also, very often, when being connected to random players, suddenly the other person gets disconnected, and it's extremely irritating when that happens more than once."", 'I used to play on this app for a long time, but ever since I redownloaded it there has been nothing but relentless adds. As a developer myself, I am really disappointed in the developers of this game for allowing it to be so saturated with adverts. Uninstalled.', ""The app is nice. It even has a site version. The only issue is that of updates and adds. It has way too many adds. And you just cannot play it without updating it. Also, there are many bots in it. Like when you don't find anyone to play with, they match you up with bots which is really annoying. Also, the banning stuff. I mean they don't ban people who need to be banned. But they ban those who don't. I've been banned twice, without any reason. Its really annoying! You should fix it!"", ""It's been two years since I had this app, it was better before there were ads. But, ads aside, it's very glitchy now always saying something went wrong. I have the latest update on a galaxy note 10. Doesn't seem to be very many players either which is sad because the trivia is very fun. Not a fan of these monster characters either.... if you like trivia, no matter these subject this app is very fun."", ""Best app for quiz ever played . Includes many topics, hundreds of them are for you to choose from and many many more are for you to choose from. Every topic has its own leaderboard . The best thing is that it's fully free with only some ads which bring points for the player.,"", ""Would have been a 5 but the new idea of opening boxes and building little assistants is a step backwards. Having to stop every 3 games and open a box is pointless and far less appealing than the achievement banners they replaced. As for the adverts i.was happy to.pay to remove them and as you can block opponents you don't wish to interact with I don't find that a problem either."", ""Pay for ad-free 'experience' (like it's netflix); pay for 'entry' tickets (like it's superbowl); pay for 'mining' gems (like the govt. is issuing licenses for extraction of minerals); and then watch a 30-second ad to 'earn' a single, freakin ticket! Either the developers are vying to 'acquire' Google or planning to construct another 'Burj Khalifa!' I wish to gain knowledge and engage in fair competition; not shell out 'green paper' for entering every tournament like it's the Olympics! Sad 😔!"", ""Although the interface is very clean, I was very much pushed back by the numerous ads, the heavy battery drainage and the frustrating fact that every 5 questions you get one about one of three topics which are completely different, and most of the time in which you are much less knowledgeable about. Some questions even are wrong. Yes you can put redstone dust on top of glass blocks in Minecraft, I'm sorry but it is possible."", ""Since Glu has decided to add the nightmarish hybrid of Patrick and Mr. Krabs (if they were caught in a devastating accident,) the whole app has gone downhill. Nobody asked for a squad or for the app to look like teeny-bopper land. The requests were actually add new topics and update existing ones. Now it's more like drive every player with integrity out with the way they keep cramming boosts down our throats."", 'Your app becomes a pile of irrelevant ""s""word... I\'ve played and enjoyed it before... But now it becomes very intriguing... I used to get questions about topics that i\'m interested in, but now it keeps giving me questions about stuff that I didn\'t select in my interest and I\'m not following it (exp: load of questions about the TV show friends and I didn\'t neither select nor follow friends or any other TV shows).im leaving with a conclusion that it becomes designed to make the player loose....', 'I am a purist,so I saw little reason to change, I Loved the ""original"", (to me; circa 2015) so the ""improvements"" came as an unnecessary and unlooked for change, bringing nothing except perhaps the removal of some cheaters... NOT ALL. It is still a good game, though, like the saying goes; ""Too many cooks spoil the broth."" This should be taken seriously into account, lest the whole initial intent of the game goes out the window when the new and improved comes in... (ಥ_ಥ = just sick in L.A.)', 'Wow this app went from being one of my favourite apps to a very frustrating one. I love the social aspect of this app as I have made friends through it. I have also paid for no ads and I was enjoying it. But recently the app just keeps crashing and does not start at all. What a shame I had to give a low rating', 'I\'ve been playing this game for years, including beta testing. who felt the need to add ""qluzos""??? completely unnecessary, and distract from the game itself. there\'s too much going on in the app, and it literally didn\'t let me exit the intro to qluzo screen until I restarted the app. very disappointing to return to, and I\'m sorry but I probably won\'t play any more. those things ruin my player aesthetic.', ""Downloaded again after I few years and I mean, honestly what's the point of the characters.. that and the excessive ads are my only complaints, other than that it's still pretty enjoyable. I just have no desire to unlock these monster characters or whatever they are, it's pointless and should just be removed, straight up."", ""It's a shame, this used to be a user-friendly quiz, it's now just another gimmicky app full of distracting powerups and characters who serve no discernable purpose in a pvp quiz setting. Glad to see everyone feels the same about the recent updates."", 'Absolutely stupid. Whenever I open the app after opening it, it works fine. After that, if I open it again, it just crashes every. God. Damn. Time. I have a pixel 2, I have a good internet connection. It just crashes every time. Uninstalled.', 'I really dont like all the extra stuff they added. It slowed the game down and its just very busy. I liked it as a simple triva game. Since all the mascot stuff was added the game kinda went down hill for me.', ""When i tapped on it send me back to my homescreen i couldn't even play it and my phone is a new phone and plus can you fix this bug so i can play or other people can play too if they have this bug and i even tried to uninstall it and install but it still won't work."", ""The last round is too important. I can be in front by two rounds, 40 points, and the oponent can tie it or win it still. It shouldn't count as 2 rounds, but 1,5 rounds maximum, ( 30 points)."", 'It was better before, when ""Echelons"" were not at the game. Also there are too much Ads. Older versions were better because the game tends to be simple, only a trivia, not a social media', 'Used to be great, but now you practically cant play without being bombarded with ads. I get you need to earn money, but jeez an ad after every single round is just annoying, specially in single player. Not to mention the on screen ads.', 'Used to be great. Now you have to watch some trash advert after every quiz as well as having permanent banner ads across the top of the screen. Plus you have to buy currency to play in tournaments so you can have any chance of winning.', ""Everytime i play multiplayer with a certain topic, when it comes to question 5 or 6 THE GAME CRASHED AND KICK ME OUT OF THE BATTLE. I WAS GOING TO WIN AND IT JUST CRASHED. it's not even about my phone. Other games that i played are just fine. I really hope you would find a solution to this dammit."", ""Started fine, set up was easy but as soon as I load in I get disconnected from the game and then I click to open again and it still won't work. Look please fix this I was looking forward to playing with my friends on this."", ""This is a one star because of the wildcard thing. I love the app but I have to remove it because I can't progress in the subjects I'm good at or want to practice because of the wild card that gets me random subjects. This should be an optional thing, not a forced thing."", ""With the new update of the whenever I open my app there is a qluzo cartoon upgrade suggestion and when I click on the next button it doesn't disappear from my page and I am not able to see my page whats the problem with it I have good network connection my phone version and memory is Fine I uninstall the app and reinstall it but the problem is same please suggest me a solution"", ""This game used to be so much fun, but now it is just annoying. The app has gotten cluttered and there's way too much going on for what was once a simple trivia game."", ""It's fun as well as educative ,had a great time playing I still play and learn New things every day.

It also shows the statistic for fastest, slowest & average time for users who use this app. Really makes me excited to do better."", ""Real honest, it's a Sudoku app, you can't really get it wrong. But I give it 5 stars still because it offers the option never to rate the app, which is great because it's Sudoku, so, you know, you can't really get it wrong"", 'So far the best application I found. Easy and relaxing. Like the fact they give the option. For the guessing (smaller) numbers.', ""This is, by far, my favorite Sudoku app. 1) the controls are easy to use 2) the settings are very customizable—more so than any other Sudoku app I've tried (as far as how you interact with the game) 3) of all the apps I've tried, this one feels the most pen-and-paper"", 'Great concept, works on previous versions of android, but it is not allowing the pencil function to work on this version.', ""Vast selection of sudoku puzzles at a good range of standards. My only criticism is that sometimes I accidentally enter a number without meaning to and don't realise until much later!"", 'One of the very few games I play on my phone. I find it more appealing as well as easier to use than most. I find its layout and colour scheme less distracting than other sudoku puzzles. This allowes me to concentrate on the actual puzzle and not the whistles.', ""Greedy, but not so many commercials, I wold buy full version but its monthly sub. Overall great app, few bugs i noticed. One is when you get your puzzle to a end it knows to get me an error from small numbers because i didn't delete them since im at the end of a puzzle."", 'Easy on the ads for the free version. I also like the game play interface.', 'I like this version because it is tolerant of new players. Gives you more mistakes.', '""Problem setting up in-app billing, please sign into your Google account or try another device."" All I want to do is try the automatic pencil marks to see how this game compares to Brainium. I don\'t mind paying the money but it is really lame that I can\'t try the automatic pencil marks for even one day without paying money first even though I don\'t mind paying money but your game won\'t accept my money. I have never had a problem getting other apps to accept my money including Brainium. Interestingly they let me try all advanced features for free and I liked the game so I gave them money. See how that works?', ""I love the squiggly! I got tired of the other kind. Fun game! Can't get enough of it! It's addicting! I'm going to need counseling pretty soon I think!"", 'Good for my aging brain! Can change the game and level of difficulty. No problems with this game.', 'Few annoying adds and only briefly ones at that. Good game with challenging levels. Have some doubts about the ratings of my performance against others but it does not detract from the quality of the game', 'Have been playing this for a few weeks. Nice assortment of difficulty levels. I like that, if you use the tiny reminder numbers, when the square is solved it removes the hint numbers from the other squares - saves a lot of fiddling about.', 'The app has helpful features to eliminate some of the drudgery. It shows when a number has been used in all sections, and it has a handy ""pencil"" feature for uncertain numbers.', ""Sometimes I accidentally touch a spot & a number comes up that's not correct & then it's difficult to erase."", 'Only knew about this game about six months back when on holiday in London and only got to understand the jargon and different moves of the game by the prompt which guides you through the next move. Recommend for beginners', 'It is convenient and the very easy section is very very easy. The easeness of the game makes it a little boring. But still it is quite engaging and addictive.', 'Great challenge to progress from standard versions. Love it.', ""The input isn't intuitive and easy to use. The UI is very unattractive. My first puzzle was actually impossible due to the numbers. I was looking to try other Sudoku games because I've beaten my usual one and want more challenging puzzles but this one is a mess. One thing I like about my other app is you can skip ads by pressing the back key."", ""This is the best game I've ever downloaded. No annoying noises or animation, yet it's visually appealing enough that it's not boring. One REALLY big suggestion, though. PLEASE include a way to mark in a cell that a number is NOT a possibility. That is my only complaint. Otherwise, the game is perfect for me. Thank you."", 'Good game, but it is too difficult to advance to the next board. There should just be a ""next"" button at the bottom of the screen. And there is no erase function to fix mistakes.', 'This app very nice app 👌 in this we can create our own Sudoku and play. In this many challenges Sudoku is their compared to another Sudoku apps it is best of best Sudoku I very played. Thank you developer for developing this wonderfully app for us. 🙏', 'I like this app compared to some similar because it usually tells you why it removes a candidate (hidden,crosshatch,etc.) On the down side sometimes it ignores some logic to go strait for a kill shot ( ie: this square is 5, but we cant say exactly why) , for instance I had to clear the candidates from a locked/hidden triple for it, as well as manually enter a hidden single it was ignoring. Other than that its a fairly nice app.', 'Great game with easy to use features. Love the fact that it compares your times to others and that it has such a wide range of levels. Love it!', ""I'm addicted to this game! I love how they have 3 different levels. Easy, medium and hard. When I have mastered one level I can move on to the next."", ""Pretty good. Doesn't crash, so far. A bit clunky interface, but decent. Good app."", ""Nice and easy input. But.. where is the continuity of difficulty? One medium is easy 8 leisurely minutes, the next 45 minutes of head scratching how are they the same? Don't get me wrong, I'm enjoying this app but, where is the continuity?"", 'What I like least about this Sudoku is having to switch between full-size numbers (to add to the spaces) and notes (little numbers as reminders). I waste time when I forget to switch and have to correct the screen. What I like best is the reports on time to completion, comparing my performance to past performances and to those of others.', ""The app permissions listed in the play store are reasonable. However when you download the app, in order to use it you have to confirm to their terms. This includes giving them access to contacts details (this is other people's info, not even yours to give away!), email addresses, PHOTOS, ip address, & all sorts. If you need to accept these in order to play, these should be listed under app permissions in the Google store. Very sneaky way to get access to almost everything on a users phone!"", 'Ads are ok. Ones with sound are not the app was removed due to loud ads popping up', 'Good game but there are unreal scores made by persons. I think they put the game in pause mode, resolve the game by other means and resume the game to write the solution. So there are people that resolves hard sodokus in 11 seconds only .... just to hit the scores...', ""This game was amazing for a long time but then started to open the play store and install other apps without my permission. It was really buggy and started to slow down my phone. I don't know what was going on but the problem was fixed when I uninstalled. I really want to find another app like this but all the others are terrible."", 'Hi guys, I loved your game for years but from the update I cant delete the old game I played and that force me to play the old game again and again. When I start a new game its always 1 of 5 different boards, no more different games but always the same games. I know them by heart now and that makes me board with your game. I hate the updated one. Its always the same 5 games nothing els. I wish I had the one without your update.', 'Perfect controls. Enough assistance. Ideal for those who like to handle challenges unassisted.', ""I like that it doesn't alert you if you have a number in the wrong place."", ""This is the best soduko app around. The most useful feature is the 'pencil planning' where the numbers are automatically removed when you solve related cells. I lost this app when I swapped phones and I have spent months searching for it again. No other soduko app comes anywhere close to this one for enjoyment."", ""I love Sudoku & this app provides easy play & configs. The classic is pretty easy on the eyes, but the dark version is not. It'd be nice to have a shade that allows play even on headache days when I need to clear my mind. Love the diff modes & levels of play!"", 'Liked the game. Just uninstalled. I can understand and live with the small banner ads. But this app now opens your browser without permission and tries to hijack your phone.

[Update to previous review]: The ad-relatred issues I was experiencing appear to be resolved. Ads are very reasonable, and gameplay is satisfying."", ""Always had this game and always loved it but after the update before last, the game crashes after dev logo screen. It's been around a month now already."", ""The creators of this game are brilliant; however, I don't understand why it's so important for them to put emphasis on the fact that they're smarter than the players by making it difficult to figure it out. Some puzzles are almost defeating and unsolvable. Word of advice: after you've made moves that don't work, try moves you haven't made and you'll win. I don't quit until I win. Veteran players don't need hints just fair puzzles."", ""Legitimately my favorite time-killing app. I don't write reviews often, but this app stands out. 1) If you only have a minute to play, you can still enjoy the game without having to refocus your attention. Perfect for multi-tasking!!! 2) The ads aren't intrusive. They don't bother me. 3) It's not addictive, yet I don't get tired of it. 4) If I'm stuck on a plane with nothing to do, I can play this game for hours and not get bored. Theres even multiple play modes to make things interesting."", 'a very good app, only one thing annoying: quitting the game, does one really want to confirm the exit questions like ""are You really sure...."" what I would really like is a ""panic"" button, one click closing an app. addition: it\'s getting worse!l After the last update the app ""forgets"" which lavels have already been solved, starts from level 1', ""My phone heats up a lot while playing the game and battey drains a lot faster than usual.

- Bug Fixes and Performance Improvements","[""i have played this game since it came out and in comparison to today's version; the developers have really whored out this game in terms of the ability to spend money on premiums. i guess they have to make money somehow, but they are against the consumer for this one (an average pay-for-advantage game). do not purchase the removal of ads premium. it is not mentioned anywhere in their terms of service that any purchase is nulled without a refund, if you change phones or factory reset your phone."", ""Really awful compared to how it used to be. Ads are intrusive and distracting. Weird irrelevant new features like these little characters you get assigned. Game play is glitchy. I only played 3 rounds since reinstalling and I'm pretty sure at least 2 of the opponents weren't real people. All my previous progress was wiped out from when I used to play before. Ugh. Won't be back."", ""I played this game when it first came out and I loved it. It's totally different now. You can't complete a full game without spending gems or watching ads. It's so frustrating. I can only answer a few questions before I inevitably get one wrong and am forced to exit because I'm not paying for gems."", ""This isn't the game that came out. The game's screwed up with unnecessary features and glitches which closes the app randomly. Not going to complain about the ads because that's what keeps the developers going. But the developers screwed up the app that was simple, elegant and memorable. Now it's just trash with extra features, which is still trash"", ""MY biggest complain is WHY we should give ticket to join an elite tournament. It used to be all about your skill in elite tournament. And it is fair to lose the coin you bet because you will gain twice as much if you win. TO BE FAIR, isn't it logical to get twice the ticket we bet if we win? OR AT THE VERY LEAST, we get the ticket back, in the same amount we bet, IF WE WIN. The added rule to this elite tournament which USED TO BE FAIR to be UNFAIR is just meh"", ""I'm highly disappointed with this game. I used to play quizup earlier and used to love it then but then I had to uninstall it for some reason. I again installed it recently and it has become the worst game ever. I tried multiple times and kept on trying but it kept on showing error and the game did not start even once. Highly disappointed I needed some fun time. I think after these many bad reviews the developer needs to do something about it or may be they don't give a damn now."", 'In addition to this game having become a pale shaddow of what it was in the beggining, it not even works with the latest version. I just log in and a red box appears with ""failed to load config data"". The options are \'try again\' which doen\'t work and \'Quit\'. What a joke. I tried clearing cache and data, reinstall and the same thing. I won\'t miss it given the fact that most of your users have abanoned the game and it\'s mostly bots and ads nowadays the entire app.', 'QuizUp was way better when it didn\'t try to be a social media platform, or have tons of microtranscations for multiple currencies, or have these ""Echelon"" things. I liked how simple the app was. The UI is a mess now. At least the trivia is on point. It would be nice if we could adjust the font size for questions.', ""It used to be a good game until they keep forcing you to open these annoying silver or gold boxes every time you want to play Also they run adverts that block the 'x boxes' forcing you to watch them. It's just really cluttery now Too much clutter. Too many pop ups, boxes to open Keep it simple please. It used to be great. I just want to open my phone and play a quiz without fifty tasks to complete first."", ""I used to play this a few years ago, it was a great app back then! Tried it again (Jan'20) and I couldn't even recognise it! They have massively sold out to advertising, so much that the game is no longer enjoyable. Therefore, I'm sad to say that I have deleted the app in search for something else."", ""A wonderful quiz game. I know how great it was 5 years ago and how many technical issues (and others) there are now. Instead of adding so many ads that cost space,why not ask everybody to pay say 3€? This app is absolutely worth it. I'll gladly support it if the technical glitches will be taken care of. And now these stupid comic figures? Are these supposed to attract 13-year-olds? Believe me,nobody needs these! Instead of wasting time with this nonsense, why not work at the technical issues?"", ""I used to really like this app and played everyday but the new qluzos thingying make the whole game too clunky. I don't like the update. Prefer you to update the questions! Also when are you going to add questions for Season 8 GoT??? Still waiting..... In the past I gave it 5 but not now. No motivation"", ""I've been playing for a while and obviously I'm a quizaholic.... So quiz up is right up my alley! However, there are few things I would like the creators to take note of- when you reach a higher level, it would be nice to have a change in the questions. Some of the questions are extremely repetitive. Also, very often, when being connected to random players, suddenly the other person gets disconnected, and it's extremely irritating when that happens more than once."", 'I used to play on this app for a long time, but ever since I redownloaded it there has been nothing but relentless adds. As a developer myself, I am really disappointed in the developers of this game for allowing it to be so saturated with adverts. Uninstalled.', ""The app is nice. It even has a site version. The only issue is that of updates and adds. It has way too many adds. And you just cannot play it without updating it. Also, there are many bots in it. Like when you don't find anyone to play with, they match you up with bots which is really annoying. Also, the banning stuff. I mean they don't ban people who need to be banned. But they ban those who don't. I've been banned twice, without any reason. Its really annoying! You should fix it!"", ""It's been two years since I had this app, it was better before there were ads. But, ads aside, it's very glitchy now always saying something went wrong. I have the latest update on a galaxy note 10. Doesn't seem to be very many players either which is sad because the trivia is very fun. Not a fan of these monster characters either.... if you like trivia, no matter these subject this app is very fun."", ""Best app for quiz ever played . Includes many topics, hundreds of them are for you to choose from and many many more are for you to choose from. Every topic has its own leaderboard . The best thing is that it's fully free with only some ads which bring points for the player.,"", ""Would have been a 5 but the new idea of opening boxes and building little assistants is a step backwards. Having to stop every 3 games and open a box is pointless and far less appealing than the achievement banners they replaced. As for the adverts i.was happy to.pay to remove them and as you can block opponents you don't wish to interact with I don't find that a problem either."", ""Pay for ad-free 'experience' (like it's netflix); pay for 'entry' tickets (like it's superbowl); pay for 'mining' gems (like the govt. is issuing licenses for extraction of minerals); and then watch a 30-second ad to 'earn' a single, freakin ticket! Either the developers are vying to 'acquire' Google or planning to construct another 'Burj Khalifa!' I wish to gain knowledge and engage in fair competition; not shell out 'green paper' for entering every tournament like it's the Olympics! Sad 😔!"", ""Although the interface is very clean, I was very much pushed back by the numerous ads, the heavy battery drainage and the frustrating fact that every 5 questions you get one about one of three topics which are completely different, and most of the time in which you are much less knowledgeable about. Some questions even are wrong. Yes you can put redstone dust on top of glass blocks in Minecraft, I'm sorry but it is possible."", 'Your app becomes a pile of irrelevant ""s""word... I\'ve played and enjoyed it before... But now it becomes very intriguing... I used to get questions about topics that i\'m interested in, but now it keeps giving me questions about stuff that I didn\'t select in my interest and I\'m not following it (exp: load of questions about the TV show friends and I didn\'t neither select nor follow friends or any other TV shows).im leaving with a conclusion that it becomes designed to make the player loose....', ""Since Glu has decided to add the nightmarish hybrid of Patrick and Mr. Krabs (if they were caught in a devastating accident,) the whole app has gone downhill. Nobody asked for a squad or for the app to look like teeny-bopper land. The requests were actually add new topics and update existing ones. Now it's more like drive every player with integrity out with the way they keep cramming boosts down our throats."", 'I am a purist,so I saw little reason to change, I Loved the ""original"", (to me; circa 2015) so the ""improvements"" came as an unnecessary and unlooked for change, bringing nothing except perhaps the removal of some cheaters... NOT ALL. It is still a good game, though, like the saying goes; ""Too many cooks spoil the broth."" This should be taken seriously into account, lest the whole initial intent of the game goes out the window when the new and improved comes in... (ಥ_ಥ = just sick in L.A.)', 'Wow this app went from being one of my favourite apps to a very frustrating one. I love the social aspect of this app as I have made friends through it. I have also paid for no ads and I was enjoying it. But recently the app just keeps crashing and does not start at all. What a shame I had to give a low rating', 'I\'ve been playing this game for years, including beta testing. who felt the need to add ""qluzos""??? completely unnecessary, and distract from the game itself. there\'s too much going on in the app, and it literally didn\'t let me exit the intro to qluzo screen until I restarted the app. very disappointing to return to, and I\'m sorry but I probably won\'t play any more. those things ruin my player aesthetic.', ""Downloaded again after I few years and I mean, honestly what's the point of the characters.. that and the excessive ads are my only complaints, other than that it's still pretty enjoyable. I just have no desire to unlock these monster characters or whatever they are, it's pointless and should just be removed, straight up."", ""It's a shame, this used to be a user-friendly quiz, it's now just another gimmicky app full of distracting powerups and characters who serve no discernable purpose in a pvp quiz setting. Glad to see everyone feels the same about the recent updates."", 'Absolutely stupid. Whenever I open the app after opening it, it works fine. After that, if I open it again, it just crashes every. God. Damn. Time. I have a pixel 2, I have a good internet connection. It just crashes every time. Uninstalled.', 'I really dont like all the extra stuff they added. It slowed the game down and its just very busy. I liked it as a simple triva game. Since all the mascot stuff was added the game kinda went down hill for me.', ""When i tapped on it send me back to my homescreen i couldn't even play it and my phone is a new phone and plus can you fix this bug so i can play or other people can play too if they have this bug and i even tried to uninstall it and install but it still won't work."", ""The last round is too important. I can be in front by two rounds, 40 points, and the oponent can tie it or win it still. It shouldn't count as 2 rounds, but 1,5 rounds maximum, ( 30 points)."", 'It was better before, when ""Echelons"" were not at the game. Also there are too much Ads. Older versions were better because the game tends to be simple, only a trivia, not a social media', 'Used to be great, but now you practically cant play without being bombarded with ads. I get you need to earn money, but jeez an ad after every single round is just annoying, specially in single player. Not to mention the on screen ads.', 'Used to be great. Now you have to watch some trash advert after every quiz as well as having permanent banner ads across the top of the screen. Plus you have to buy currency to play in tournaments so you can have any chance of winning.', ""Everytime i play multiplayer with a certain topic, when it comes to question 5 or 6 THE GAME CRASHED AND KICK ME OUT OF THE BATTLE. I WAS GOING TO WIN AND IT JUST CRASHED. it's not even about my phone. Other games that i played are just fine. I really hope you would find a solution to this dammit."", ""Started fine, set up was easy but as soon as I load in I get disconnected from the game and then I click to open again and it still won't work. Look please fix this I was looking forward to playing with my friends on this."", ""This is a one star because of the wildcard thing. I love the app but I have to remove it because I can't progress in the subjects I'm good at or want to practice because of the wild card that gets me random subjects. This should be an optional thing, not a forced thing."", ""With the new update of the whenever I open my app there is a qluzo cartoon upgrade suggestion and when I click on the next button it doesn't disappear from my page and I am not able to see my page whats the problem with it I have good network connection my phone version and memory is Fine I uninstall the app and reinstall it but the problem is same please suggest me a solution"", ""This game used to be so much fun, but now it is just annoying. The app has gotten cluttered and there's way too much going on for what was once a simple trivia game."", ""I genuinely love Quizup, but dear god the Qluzos either need to go or we need an option to turn them off. I don't wanna deal with them in any way, I don't wanna see them or collect items for them. Just let me do quizzes in peace without being haunted by a rotund little monster.""]"

I like to play it with my family and answer the many questions it has. The main issue I have the game is its ads and microtransactions. Ads take forever to get through and these ads are regularly used to get things like powers. And Microtransactions are just annoying. But overall, the game is amazing.

You can skip a lot of them, but for the ones you can't skip, I just want yall to know that I completely close the game so I don't have to watch it. Seriously? A 60 second ad? The other thing is that sometimes the question is too long and you can't scroll to see the rest of it, so you're left with guessing what the answer is to what looks like an incomplete question."", 'Love the game, contuously buggy.

I know you make money from them but surely there have to be some limits to the way they work..."", ""Quit pushing the pay to win aspects. What even is the reason you need so much money? Please figure out a way to operate more efficiently, I can't really see your game audience growing, if every time they answer a question, they have to close 3 ads every time they do anything, and especially if you offer a cheap get out of jail card every time I answer wrong."", ""Such a shame that such a fun game has so many ads. It also glitches frequently and you lose possible points that you could have won. I have lost survival mode multiple times because it wouldn't load. It really was a fun game, very unfortunate."", ""The game is super fun and I want to keep on playing BUT it keeps on glitching and lagging and I know it's not my phone because none of my other games do it. I hope it gets fixed because I honestly love the game but it's hard to play with all that stuff happening."", ""Way too many ads, it's insane. After a loss...ad, after a win...ad, in between questions...ad. Wanna try again to answer the question?... watch another ad. Wanna change game menus?... watch another ad. I can GUARANTEE that if the frequency of ads dropped then the player base would increase, its that simple."", ""I love the game and competition but there are so many ads not to mention the different options you have to wade through that as soon as I finish my open games I will uninstall because it's so very aggravating. I hate it cause I do love the game but all of the above I mention just makes it not worth it!!!"", ""I love this game however their survival mode is trash even though it gives you the most points league-wise. The questions aren't vetted and a lot of them have incorrect answers which isn't fair at all when they are trying to get you to spend money and use your points. Big letdown."", 'It\'s a good game, but whenever I am playing survival mode, the loading takes forever. Because of this I always lose because ""I took too long to answer""', 'Newest vidoe ads, which appear to be mostly political, shrink the play area of the screen and completely cover the buttons you need to tap to continue playing. I get that ads are a part of a free game, but selling out to the political ads and letting them completely overtake the game is ridiculous.', ""Its a great game. Been playing for a long time. But out of all the games I play this one has a TON of ad's. That gets irritating especially when you're in the middle of a round. Otherwise its a great game for testing one's knowledge."", ""Glitchy and Buggy: Has lots of bugs, will make you watch an ad in order to continue and then when the ad is finished it will bug out. I have a new phone running new OS, so it's not my fault. Don't download if you want an ad every 45 seconds of playing to continue, only to have the app screw you over."", 'The best quiz app by far, not retarded questions about the surname of the cat of the captain of titanic. Good questions thats more or less ""easy"" if you\'re assertive within the different categories. And its not too Americanized either, which is something most quizgames seem to be, hence there will be questions about american history, but also european, asian and world hustory, the sport category is probably the only Americanized which 4-5 times is questions about American NFL/NBA teams.', ""I didn't even get a chance to login to Get The Chance To Play! They kept saying they've sent me a reset pw, but when I checked, Nothing. I'm done! Uninstalling. Don't waste your time!"", 'I installed this app. ATTEMPTED to play. I had the app installed for approximately four minutes. Three and a half of those minutes was nothing but ads. Uninstalled.', ""There's so many ads in-between games, in-between lives, in-between questions! And there are so many pop ups just from trying to get from one menu to the next, all usually trying to wrestle you into a micro transaction. Not worth the trouble to play this game!"", 'Uninstalled within 15 mins Loads of ads, asking for money almost straight away. Answered 5 questions then got one wrong, that was then followed by 7 minutes looking at a screen that said you got a question wrong now wait for your opponent to have their go. Better things to do than look at a semi blank screen.', 'I enjoy the game, but the ads covered the buttons in the game, wish I could give this zero stars.

Few to may pop ups however. And the pig.. Never known its reason. Other then prying money from us. Other then that. Great fun game 👍👌💪', 'I seems like a lot of questions fall through the review crack. Some ""right"" answer are questionable or more than one answer could be considered correct. Over all it\'s an entertaining game.', ""Love this game I know I have to pay for the ad free version but it's highly frustrating when you skip the option to watch the video ad for a second chance then are forced to watch one anyway...."", 'A wonderful app which will increase your general knowledge as well as test them against anyone in a competitive match. The thing I like most is that there are many categories where you can test your GK whenever you want.', 'Lags due to ads trying to load. I don\'t feel it necessary to purchase the ad free if I can play for free. Though it\'s what they say. You get what you ""pay"" for', ""Was once really fun however now ads make it basically unplayable. After every single round an add pops up as well as 3 different deals and optional ads to watch for another turn. If this game didn't turn into such a big money grab it would actually be fun."", ""Way too many ads. The over saturation is ridiculous. I understand there will be some ads given its a free game. But it's honestly almost every 30 seconds. This game is not at all worth a download."", 'Used to be a great app but the amount of ads and marketing methods to get you to spend money have gotten carried away.', ""An excellent trivia app and a lot of fun. Very addicting. Lots of ads but I guess that's the price of admission."", 'The ads bother me sometimes since there is always ones popping up, even when I choose not to watch the ad. Great game though, my boyfriend and I love it', ""Fun game but way too many ads. Ads every other question is ridiculous. I saw that the ad free version wasn't any better. I used to play this all the time now I remember why I uninstalled it."", ""It's only been 10 days since KobeBryant died and they already have a trivia question about it. Yes trivia crack, TOO SOON. Free has loads of ads, but most are skippable and its still enjoyable to play."", 'There are way too many ads, a ton of glitches, also, some of the questions are NOT correct! I have verified this personally.. I question why I waste my time with this app.', ""It would be fun if you weren't bombarded by ads. They'll pop up when you're actually playing and you're being timed, and no, the timer doesn't stop while the ad plays. Find a different trivia app."", 'Ridiculous amounts of ads and pop ups within the game. After getting every question wrong I have to press X (close) atleast 5 times and wait 15 seconds for an ad to finish. Many questions are also from the wrong category.', ""Initially enjoyed the game. But the number of questions which are poorly phrased or misleading is frustrating. There are so many answers which are incorrect it's bizarre. If the app were to allow for a question enquiry with the view to edit, it would make all the difference. One gets the feeling that the developers have done their job and are letting it run on its own.Trivia is not only a way to test your knowledge, but a great way to learn new things of interest. It fails totally in this regard""]"

Game on!","[""Now that I have a tablet, Lumosity is much more fun. I highly recommend playing it on a tablet or iPad, as it's hard to see what you need to on a phone, in particular the game where you try to find the differences in shapes. My favorites are the train game, and the one where you fit the shapes into the pattern. Least favorite is pinball and the pirate ship. It doesn't always allow you to take the path that would make the most sense.

There is a huge range of engaging apps designed to help improve areas (such as memory, attention, maths etc), and the wide range means that I am never bored and it is most certainly not repetitive like some aps (plus no annoying ads in-between each game which is a big bonus!). Absolutely love this ap, definitely 5*!', ""I've been playing the Lumosity Brain Training Games for about two years now and I have to be honest with you, I Absolutely Treasure my daily 3 free games. And have without a doubt, noticed a dramatic increase in sharper memory/ quicker responses in cognitive behavior in all areas of my day to day life and in general. It has impacted my personal attitude towards myself immensely in recognizing my abilities that without playing Lumosity, would have gone unnoticed. 👩\u200d🎓"", 'Great app. Been using it for some time now (free version). Some of the games are quite challenging (trains and coffee), but some are quite tedious (fuse clues and pirate passages).

Progress is very satisfying. But it\'s not without issues. In ""raindrops"" for example it\'s easy to miss the buttons - They\'re so small, and the space in between them doesn\'t exactly help. And in ""word snatchers"" you can\'t type words in quickly - It won\'t recognize some button presses so you\'re forced to write slow, resulting in score loss 😖.', 'The app is good. Feels solid, no problems with it. To bad premium is expensive (and an subscription). Otherwise i would have gotten that. Free app is still entertaining, at least, for now.', ""I love love love this app, the games are fun, and they're actually good mental challenges. Most apps that claim to train your brain will only give you sudoku or crosswords which aren't actually that good for brain training. My one problem with this app is I want to buy the premium version but it's a monthly payment rather than one time! I would even be willing to pay more if it were just once.

• Various bug fixes and improvements throughout the app","[""Fun app. I enjoy the games and feel like I've made some gains in memory and processing speed. However, the ranking system is off and always gives fewer points than I've earned. Once or twice it has even taken points away, immediately after earning them! In addition, syncing points across devices does not seem to work, even after backing up progress. Points earned on my phone seem to vanish on my tablet. For a $40 subscription, this is unacceptable. I would give the app 5 stars if this was fixed."", ""I've been playing this for many months straight for FUN. Not anything else. There are too many instances where some of the score given is dependant on how fast you can manipulate the interface when giving an answer. Sometimes you know the answer right away but it is difficult to enter the answer while you lose points. Other times you don't need to know the answer and can quickly tap the remaining choice for optimal speed score. This app isn't an accurate measurement of your ability. Not worth $"", 'Great app , only used it for 3 days and I am already showing improvement in clarity of speech and in my writing. Doing a session each morning gets the brain working and beats any kind of coffee!', 'Since i bought it I can proudly say that THIS IS THE BEST BRAIN IGNITION application. Not game, but has procedures likewise. Really in a week or two you shall give more recorcefullness than before. Just with the basic, free app model. After a few weeks you really should try PRO model, gives much, much and much more. GoodJob, People, THANKS for monthly subscription, I can buy it now :)', 'Good but could be improved. The math games keep me sharp. Some of the verbal games are annoying though. I think the worst one is ""Memory"". Most of the challenge of that game is finding the letters needed to spell out the obvious answer, like ""natural"" or ""cancel"". These are not words anyone should have trouble remembering. Wish there was a way to raise the difficulty on the vocab based games. Also, the animation after you finish a game is gratuitously slow and the sounds get old.', ""This seems to be the best of these kind of apps (at least, that I've tried). The games are fun and seeing your improvement and rankings is interesting.... but be aware, it's a 7 day free trial and after that costs 40 BUCKS! Which is a pretty insane price point for an app. I don't think I'll pay it and I'd suggest to the developer that very few people would willingly pay it, the ones you're getting are probably mostly being tricked- not cool. It claims there's a free version but I don't see it."", ""I love this app!!! It has helped me immensely to increase my skills and confidence. I feel like I can recall words and synonyms better, and therefore I'm more confident in social situations. I think it improved my Wonderlic score, as well! My one complaint is the Estimations game. No matter how well I do on it, my scores stay in the 25% range. I have no idea why. Otherwise, I love this app, and I play almost every day! Inversion is my favorite game... so fun, with the bubbles!!!"", ""Great app that allows you to learn and get better at basic principles of speaking, spelling, grammar, and math. The only reason I didn't put at 5 stars was due to the fact that they push their pro so much, and that they don't allow as much with their free. It's a tremendous help for everyone, whether you are good or not."", 'I love this app. I broke my old phone and managed to download this app to my new phone and thanks to my Google sign in all my scores were saved. The bad habits you pick up with grammar after school is horrifying. This app irons out all your bad habits, gives tips on how to improve and gradually increases the level of skills based on your scores and achievements on a daily basis. Great way of keeping up to date with key skills.', 'This is my favorite game in the entire app collection of Google and galaxy play stores. I love the idea of progressional unlocking levels/ games is ingenious and the anticipation of being able to see all of the games ,but waiting to be able to unlock them is probably the thing keeping my attention the most. The actual content is mostly challenging and relevant to everyday life with some material that is more advanced, only badges are lacking for the gratification/effort.', ""I have both Elevate and Lumosity and, although the latter is good, Elevate is, in my opinion, far superior. I believe that it has already improved my writing and maths abilities even in the short time I have used it. Also, the dev support is responsive, which is a serious plus. I'm on the free version now (which, even so, has no intrusive adverts), but am definitely considering getting a subscription."", 'Downloaded it hoping it wasn\'t yet another app falsely promising to prevent alzheimers or ""cure"" adhd. I still don\'t know if it is, because it gives you about 2 minutes of playability a day, so I didn\'t spend much time in the app. Otherwise, pay annually for the premium version. There isn\'t even a monthly option. Come on. Every app that does this gets slammed... why don\'t devs ever clue in? Oh, and if you have to make a tutorial for how to ""find"" the free version of your app, maybe don\'t hide it', ""This app is an amazing way I've improved my reading and mental math as well as vocab. I really enjoy using this app, however I am using a laptop and the Elevate does not seem to be very compatible with the computer. I've had some games where I am able to type but I cannot enter the words. This might be the computer I'm using or not, nonetheless it would be great if elevate was made to fit the display of a laptop."", 'Great Brain Trainer. I really enjoy this app. On a daily basis, it allows me to ""shake the cobwebs out of the old brain"" and progress. The training itself is a plus 5, however there is some issue with billing. I paid for the year\'s subscription to ""pro"", however only the free training sessions are available to me. I paid through my Google Play account. According to those records, my subscription is valid, yet the game only allows for the free content. The game itself, 5, billing Is 1. 😔 Update Feb 2020, Everything is now 5+ stars. The billing issue has been resolved and all is well. Thank You for the resolution and this Brain game! :-D', ""Originally I had intended to give this app (3) stars as it does have some good ideas. However, the yearly price is outrageous. This is a $10.00 app AT BEST, not a $40.00 one. Secondly, the time trial mentality is infuriating. You know what I want to do? Improve my comprehension and response time. You know what doesn't do that? Listing a story word by word in a fairly brisk speed and then asking me for specifics. That's not challenging, it's a infuriating. Speed is not comprehension."", ""I use both Evaluate and Lumosity and I think this one is better by far. I don't have a subscription for either so I don't get to enjoy all of the perks, but that is okay. Without the subscription there are still plenty of activities to work though, helpful hints and tips, and also some very nice materials to help you with subjects you have lover scores in. In the future I think I might subscribe to get all of the perks, but it doesnt feel like its required. I would definitely recommend this app."", 'Really enjoying challenging myself with this app. I like how it increases in difficulty as you improve and it tracks your progress. I also like how many different elements there are, focussing on everything from punctuation to spelling and maths. It gives you extra study in the areas you are weakest.', 'Fantastic but still things to improve. There so many good words mentioned but i need to screenshot in most games in order to gather the words used for the day. Every game should have all the words for the day at the end with the definition so when they change the next day it is a new batch. We will reach new depths into the learning process. I would say I have learned only about 5% of the new words I have seen properly and the connotation/sort of meaning of 20-25%. We can improve the quality.', ""I'm definitely being challenged. Purpose served. The format is approachable. I like the compartmentalized format to see accomplishment more readily. Perhaps if an interest survey was had at the beginning then the context of questions would be more enticing supporting momentum for learning wanting more than the allotted daily session. Thank you for this app."", ""I love this app. Since I started using it, I've noticed significant improvement in my writing and verbal communication. Even my math skills improved. It's a really great app. Although sometimes, a game refuses to load for no reason at all and I have to switch to another game. Please try to fix that problem"", 'The game is challenging, but the challenges are clearly defined, exercising narrow areas of skill, and it has shown me clearly areas in my learning where I can improve. I believe that with continued use of this app, those weaknesses will be strengthened. The mechanic of the app is sound and engaging.', ""Overall a good app. As a foreigner, I don't know some of the expression showing in one exercise, so it makes hard to get things right, but it's good that I'm learning them. Also some explanations about the mistakes are not really helpful, maybe there is a need of being more detailed ?"", 'I love the game, I think it really helps me learn and relearn everything as a busy adult. Only downside is paying for all of the games. Without paying you can only play 3 specific games they give you that day. After the day is over you can play the 3 different games they give you.', ""Beating one's last high score definitely becomes addictive. Good content, but wish some sessions weren't timed to go so quickly because you could actually learn something if you weren't being competitive with yourself. Session shut down a handful of times, but overwhelmingly dependable. I feel like my mental math has definitely improved and the writing sessions have improved my ability to be more effective."", 'This is a fantastic app!!! It not only makes learning fun, but it tracks your progress and targets weak areas in your knowledge. The way Elevate plays is just like it is a game, but it then addresses your specific needs and provides tips on how to improve your abilities', ""I really like this app! I've been using the free version for ~2 months now and it's such a quick brain workout (5-10min). The animations and games themselves are user-friendly, but they're tailored to you so each day is slightly challenging (i.e. it doesn't feel like a gimmick). With the free version, you're randomly assigned 3 games each day (which you can replay) and it tracks your scores against others within your age demographic, which is so interesting! I genuinely like this app."", ""Compared to Lumosity and Peak, I find this app to be the best pick. Lumosity is more Game-like in design, Peak is somewhat stuck inbetween, While Elevate actually gives me words and math problems to solve. Personally it feels like it helps more, especially with my spelling, grammar, common phrases, and reading (and processing!!) speeds. Mathematically wise, so far I've been given tasks to calculate percentages, work with fractions, and estimate the sum of prices. Looks better than Peak."", ""Very very good brain Training app. BUT!!! You have one exercise with unit conversion, that would be very good and make me give the remaining 3 stars, IF! The imperial units could be removed. As a European, I've lived with only the metric system and even if I have a vague Idea of what the imperial system is like, I have no ambition to adapt to the 5% of the world population who's stuck with this measurement system. Fix it, by adding a slider or something, and you get three stars extra. ;)"", ""After searching for a while, this is the best brain training app for me. But then, like the majority of people here, I realized it's just a super lame 7-day trial, and insisting debit card and credit card info. I could understand a one time payment of 43 USD, but 43 USD for annual subscription? Screw you. Go to hell."", ""The app is good, but they should be more professional and notify you through the app when your subscription has ended. Came an expected bill of an annual subscription that I forgot to revise it. If you don't consider paying, cancel it right after you do the mandatory subscription to access the trial."", 'A language & math focused all. Elevate, as compared to Lumosity, is more focused on math (estimation, percentages, quick math...etc) & language (vocabulary, punctuation, speed-reading...etc), & lack games on memory & reflexes. The Pro version opens up all the level-appropriate games in the 4 categories Elevate has: Writing, Speaking, Reading, & Math. The user interface is very colorful & animated. A lot of work has been put there to make Elevate look as beautiful as it is as a game/app.', ""It really helped me with my vocabulary, writing, math and fast thinking skills developed. It helps those moments when you don't know the right words to say and how to correct writings. It improves on how fast you think, read and react. It's a good app to help you develop and improve your skills at writing, vocabulary, math and reading skills."", 'There useful and less useful games. My favorites are subtraction, division, extraction, and speed reading. You get helpful tips and instructions, so you can actually use this app to develop these skills. I\'m only on day 8 and I intend to keep at it for the whole yearly plan. I have a fear that the games will not develop hand in hand with my skill level, but we shall see. I wish if when you click on an achievement, it would display ""so many % of players have unlocked this achievement"".', ""Okay hear me out, the app is amazing I love every minute of it. The thing I dont particularly like is the timer, because then I start to panic and pick the wrong answer, also the processing game, do you guys' really need to have the tower collapse after one wrong answer, that's over doing it and it makes me feel bad. You wanna teach me to speed read and I get that, but I can't process information if I'm just zooming by and then get a paragraph question which makes it harder. This is a great app."", ""May be a bit too early to fully develop an opinion of the training's impact on my mental skill sets, but i've been enjoying the games since I started playing 3 days ago. Based on the challenge of the games i've been given, I feel that they've properly evaluated my current skill level, and I look forward to continuing my training!"", 'Recently I started using Elevate and I am loving it. Thanks for all the efforts you put into it the app. I am not good in English so I wanted to improve my reading, listening, speaking and writing skills and I think this is the right platform. One suggestion I have is to add a speaker icon beside any new word we come across in the game. On clicking on it should pronounce the word, so that we can know how to pronounce it.', ""It's $39. But you don't find out until you install, then it's too late, they will charge you. Then it's difficult to stop, you can't just uninstall. My brain is going to be smarter because it's a test to remove, which I haven't been able to yet. . They should be upfront about $39. A year. Honesty is missing."", ""Entered my info to THEN find out that you have to pay 39.99/yr. When I X'd out of it I was then offered the free version with limited game play (3 training sessions per day). But, there are NO ads! (1st EVER app I have came across that has no ads for free version.) You can replay the same sessions to familiarize yourself with them (speed reading 😉😉) but it does not go toward your overall score. This app is fun and engaging and will have you constantly challenging your best scores."", 'Only complaint is that they don\'t foreground the fact that full functionality is locked behind a not insubstantial yearly subscription fee. It\'s also a pretty ""busy"" app, noisy, colourful and animated which might be a plus or a minus depending on you. You can switch the sounds off. Does show the developers know how to hit your dopamine triggers though.', ""It's outstanding and exceptional but of course, makes you pay. Now there is a limited, free way you can ply, and that's nice and all, but as someone who needs this very much but truly cannot afford to pay, it's frustrating and disappointing but I am grateful the the but I do get free, thus the four stars. If you can afford to pay, I'm sure it's five stars.""]"

Actually feel like my brain is getting a workout and it's awesome I can see real results. One problem that started after an update. I can no longer enter in words for the game grow easily. The steps to enter words are: enter on keyboard to make the word, it doesn't show up on screen so I have to do this blindly and pray I entered it right. Then I hit the back arrow, then enter. This process is effecting my score a bit as it takes more time than if I was just able to enter the word."", ""These ads are ridiculous. Every game has an add, nearly every screen has some pop-up. It's incredibly annoying, I wouldn't mind a one time payment to get rid of them, but all they want is a subscription. You're limited to 2 games a day without watching a video, AND you have to watch ads even for those. Edit: I found the one time payment, but it's $60! For an app!? I mean it's decent but not that great."", ""I really enjoyed the idea of this app on the first day. After the first day I was really confused because the game looked like it was only playable if you got some sort of subscription. Just after 3 days I understood that I'm only allowed to play 2 games per day. Which in my oppinion is ridiculous. I also find the life time subscription way to expensive. A 100 euros for a game just so you can play whenever you want is not worth it. I can find other games with a similar way of design for way less"", 'Fabulous app. I really enjoy the games. Worth the subscription. The only downside is that sometimes I get a black screen as it is loading to go to the next workout, and I have to force close the app and then reopen. Some games that i used to dread, i have really improved on, and now look forward to. Thanks for this creation.', 'The app concept is amazing: train your brain in about 15 minutes a day focusing on 6 key catorgies of brain muscle. Day 1 went amazing; the 6 minigames were great and my husband and I could compare scores. Day 2 and I could only play 2 out of 6 mini games for the day because the rest were premium. Looked around the app a bit more and about 98% of everything is behind their subscription. It is beyond ridiculous. Why would I pay for anything that has 15 minutes a day (AT MOST) to offer me!?', 'Wasted my money for this game. Never buy anything from this game. The comparison between your score with other people in this game also doesnt make sense. I played the matching word game. When I insert the word ""raise"" surprisingly the game does not consider it as a word. And sometimes the games intentionally changes it question patern to lower your score. Then suddenly revert back to the original patern. No consistency.', ""It works now and doesn't crash. The game however is p2p. So if you want to experience everything on the app, you have to choose a plan and pay however much you choose. If you're f2p, you have to wait 19 hrs before you can plan again. No ads, nothing. So pretty much nothing you can do, besides wait or pay."", ""Suggestion: Put on the time of the day for the more useful data performance. It would help the user to know when is his/her prime time since cognitive abilities vary troughout the day. Thank you so much for this wonderful app, I've bought the premium version for 1 year and have been using it every day for 2 weeks+. Highly recommended."", 'Does not contain any puzzles similar to those that it advertized. I downloaded the app because I enjoyed the Instagram preview puzzles, yet I was very dissapointed to find out that it is simply a series of hokey speed and memory tests. here I am uninstalling it and leaving a bad review. If you dont feel very confident about your intelligence this may be a good, albeit deveptive and arbirary, metric through which you can find some solace and peace of mind. Otherwise, save yourself the time.', ""The bugs have been fixed and I've downloaded and played. The developer was quick to respond to my negative review and informed reviewers that they were aware and working on the problem. I'll keep my original review below for reference. My first session was really fun and I think Peak was very accurate in measuring my abilities. I hope to improve in the areas where I struggle and build a stronger memory. **ORIGINAL REVIEW** It crashes without loading. I haven't gotten a chance to play yet."", 'The game is very diversified, with several games for every skill. My critique is mostly about how the ""Brain Score"" isn\'t clear. When you play a game, you get a score, which then impacts you\'re Brain Score. For example, you may score 200 points on a game, which may increase your level in that game, but still decrease your Brain Score by a few points. Why? Also, if you compare your score to people of the same age, are you comparing to people who have played as long as you or with everyone?', 'Loving it so far! A couple of issues I have noticed: 1. It wrongfully shows that you have ranked up today, although a day had actually passed and playing the game will result in level up 2. in the Perilous Path game, the grey tiles appear kind of delayed and laggy, leaving less time to see the whole thing (Android 10, Nokia)', 'I can\'t get past my \'Assesments\', I\'ve finished my assesment 3 times, every time I finish it it says ""Well done, you\'ll get your first regular workout tomorrow. See you then!"". But then the next day, guess what? another assesment. I\'ve tried looking around to get out of this loop, but came up empty-handed, I can\'t even buy premium anywhere.', ""Advertisement seems misleading. I saw an ad for this app while playing a different game & it showed brain teasers, which I love. But after installing the app, I couldn't find any brain teasers. Maybe they're locked under Pro features? Or I didn't look hard enough, but I don't feel I should have to look that hard to find what was being shown in the ad."", 'I am agree to some other reviews: only give new player an access to 4 short games make me not attached enough to this app and uninstalling. Totally not patient to wait next day yet not sure will it worth it to spend money for a game I just play for less than 10 minutes. My suggestion is give more free games for new players, or maybe free pro for some first days like what other apps do.', 'I like the stats they provide and comparisons to your age average. However it is extremely abusive with its adds. First, it had you see video adds beyond the 2nd game, then every time you wanted to repeat a game, and now every time a games ends. This made me download other apps from their competition that are considerably less invasive.', ""I want so badly to become pro, but i doubt i ever will. Possibly a great tool with great and helpful games but i guess ill never know. Peak doesn't even give you the chance to fully experience it without paying first. I cannot even complete my daily workout without first commiting money into the app. I know my one review and disdain will ultimately amount to nothing but i dont think i can support a business with such soddy practices."", 'yesterday , there was a survey of the one thing that can be improved in Peak.. I believe that the time.. 2.30 min is not enough. A focus of 2 and half minutes does not improve the overall focus. When time factor is increased, or the option of training your mind for a longer time is permitted.. then i give 5 stars..', 'I love this app! When I play regularlyI feel sharper and quicker when I need to make snap decisions or judgement calls- which is huge in my line of work. The games are pretty fun, too. Peak Premium is harder for me to review positively. I got Peak Premium on a sale where I was offered a lifetime of Peak Premium for a flat rate of $20 or so dollars. I doubt I would have got Premium if I had to pay monthly. Paying $5/mo for a few extra games would be hard to justify.', 'Response to Peaklabs: I understand that, but there are 30+ games and non-Pro users can only access 2. I get the daily notification to do the 6-game workout which is supposed to work on 6 different brain parts. But I can only do 2/6. Free users should at least be able to do the full 6/6 workout. Then PRO gives access to all games anytime.', ""This app is great. Easy to play games to train your brain. It's great to do exercises to improve your ability to become sharper and more focused. The app is so straight forward and easy to use that even people with no experience using technology such as elder people can use it. The reason why it doesn't get the 5 stars from me is because I think the app is asking for payment too early. I think they should allow the daily training to be completed before asking for payment."", 'I have not purchased any Monthly/Annual plans as of yet. I am finding the free games to be good, and I feel they are certainly stimulating my brain. My performance is improving slowly day by day. It would be nice if the games were a little cheaper to subscribe to, but apart from that, everything looks good. There are many games to choose from, and are fun to play...', 'The tests are fun and enjoyable but sadly got to rate it very low since there is nothing do until 24hrs when your next workout comes in. To play any of the games even the ones that you dont need pro to play for you have to OWN pro to play. I understand having games for only pro memebers giving a benifit for doing a monthly subscribe to there game fully understandable but having it were you cant even play any games after your workout I personally find an awful way to produce this game.', ""I do love how it keeps track of everything, but must add that in comparison with neuronation is pretty easy on you and, by the other hand, provides a bit less resources for side development than elevate. To be fair, I'm considering for those comparisons the free version of each app."", 'Games are fun but with the added fact that most of the games besides your first time are locked behind ""pro"" mode makes it to where I dont have fun or use it that often. Games make me think, they are fun, but honestly I can get as much fun from porting Brain Academy on my Ds Lite.', ""3 Stars only just because I'm not able to make a purchase of the pro functions available neither I can use net banking aur my Vodafone billing services this games or I would say this program for improving the brain functioning for the thinking ability is really good at least with the assessments which I've been doing since last two days I would really want to buy this either one time or else 1 year"", ""A lot of ads, but the app tells you when you'll have to watch an ad and going pro to get rid of them is worth it. Grow doesn't work properly on my device, and there a few errors every now and again (e.g. a game doesn't load)."", ""A recent problem with an update, which caused the app to crash and my phone to behave very oddly has been quickly rectified. I am very happy it is working again. The games are varied and good fun to play. Does my brain function any better? It is hard to say but I'm sure it is better at solving puzzles than it used to be!"", 'This one is my favorite ""brain exercise"" app. The games are entertaining and challenging. I particularly like the language and problem solving ones. Also the rating system keeps you engaged. Definitively, recommended.', 'Im having a decent amount of fun so far but encountered a problem on the game ""grow"" where i couldnt enter anymore than 1 additional letter.

Thank youuu, GRE Vocabulary Builder!"", ""Amazing app, it's helped tremendously with my vocabulary building and reflects what I'd expect to see on the GRE (having not taken it yet).

I liked the vocabulary section for GRE and GMAT the most. I highly recommend this application to those who prepare both of the tests.', 'Poor definitions.

You have the option of playing difficulty levels from easy to genius, and you can choose either a short or longer board game. You can also play against another Real Player, or against a computer bot of your choice. I used to prefer the Bot games, because of course they play quite quickly, but it's fun to play real people too, and even chat with them. You can trade all of your letters and keep your turn. You can also buy hints for the best word to play."", 'The game is great, looking forward to updates of different characters, possibly place a stake area of the game etc However! If you are dyslexic or have any learning issues or disabilities you may find this game extremely hard to play as you will not be able to see words sideways etc.... By adding the feature of seeing what your words look like horizontally like in words 2 Woukd make this game a little more friendly to play by people with such disabilities. Stephen', ""Short but sweet. I have spent 3 weeks trying to get my game back. I dont know what else to do. I tried emailing you about it but my problem falls on deaf ears. Now I'VE decided to start over again and what do I find, but my game. my User ID and all in the system. I can play the player and everthing,.but I cant get my game back. What is going on? I havent chaned my userID or email address or anything.???? I sent a msg, about this and even sent a photo of my stats and achievements in the email.. P"", ""So far I'm loving this game. It's different. I like how is got a mix of a crossword puzzle, word search, and Scrabble. And you get to choose to play alone, with friends, or random. I will change to 5 Stars after I've had 1 more day of playing though. Awesome!!!"", 'Love this game, and can keep in touch with my friends.']"
