This game reminds me of a Sega Genesis game from the 90s called Road Rash in regards to the realistic feeling of flying down the road at 120+ mph on a motorcycle. There's no fighting and hitting other bike riders here, but I'm still thoroughly enjoying the game play. It would be awesome to have curves and elevation changes (hills and valleys). But, I can't find any reason NOT to give this one 5 stars."", ""It's actually an awesome game to pass time! Reminds me of old arcade games, not too hard to learn but not too easy to get bored with. The graphics are visually appealing and the sounds are equally good. Although, after playing for a while it gets a bit boring. Saved up for the best bike on offer but apart from speed, it's no better than the other bikes from a game stand point. It's another 'enjoy it while it lasts' kind of game."", ""The game to be a lot better if you didn't have to have so much cash to do any form of upgrades on your bike or to purchase new bikes or to buy new areas of the map the gameplay seems good but all I want is your money and I understand this is how it works and I understand that the ads are how it works but there's just too much demand for wanting your money to play"", ""It's a good game but the coins add up super slow and it's really annoying being stuck unable to progress through career because you have to save up for a new bike, also when you unlock things by leveling up itd be a lot better if you didn't have to spend coins to get them, it's hard enough to save coins we could at least get the stuff we unlock for free."", ""I installed this game out of curiosity and, while it's fun to do the driving, the overtaking challenges aren't very good. First off, I'm not really sure what the criteria is to get an overtake because it seems to change all the time within the same run. As well, you get 65 seconds and you don't even see your first car until the 52 second mark. That's 20% of your time gone without seeing your first car for the overtake. Not impressed. Probably going to uninstall it because of that."", ""Good game but the night effect is very bad how can a person ride in this mode the cars are not visible and to unlock bike you want require level that's not fair if we collect cash for bike but it stuck on require level and career mode is very bad and cash also rises up slowly but graphics are good and control and stability is also good but please try to improve these things."", 'Great game! few suggestions though: 1) put transmission (both up + and down - ) on the left side of the screen. (or make it even realistic by making it 1 down 6 up) 2) make the side mirrors working.. -------------- These suggestions will be quite the stretch: 1) working intersections and/or cars that exit the highway 2) random obstacles appearing on the road (animals crossing, debris, dropped cargo, jerk drivers, etc) 3) Other bikes on the road (or a multiplayer option would be better)', ""Nice game to pass your time and can help you practice stability and consistency.

We learn how to drive the bikes and cars safely and follow the traffic rules .

I would download the nodded apk off google, just search ""traffic rider apk modded"" & it\'s free.', 'Love this game so much recommend it for anyone who likes motor bikes I just think on endless mode when you die give us a little more money because if you die like a minute in you only get 100 pounds I think you should get at least 500 but other than that it is a great game I love to play it well done !', ""So cool ...i luv it...interesting game.

Thanks 🙏"", ""It's a great game. The physics is realistic and once you've driven a couple of miles you kinda feel like it's the real thing or at least close to it. I just wish that you'd include more adventure settings of that sort..like your chasing a car or someone is chasing you and including some pedestrians wouldn't be so bad.

And I also wish there was a little more to it. But overall pretty good."", 'Great game, bike prices are super inflated. Its possible to beat tbe game, but it will take months of repetitive grinding. The roads need turns , not just straight ways. Also the AI difficulty is on a troll level. All 4 lanes have vehicles brake checking you, and cutting you off. This makes it impossible to have an A or B grade player record. I am a D+ grade. The game has much potential.', ""The game is good initially but the career mode quickly gets boring with the same syle of missions, to either overtake cars or reach before a certain time. I think a little more creativity wil go a long way in enhancing this game's appeal. For example - a ghost computer rider against whom we can compete. Or a traffic police chasing us and kicking our bike, road rash style. More powerful the bike, more resistant it is to the kicks... something of that sort."", 'I got this game about a month ago and I liked it for about a hour. I was starting to get annoyed of the cars brake checking and cutting me off. After a while the bikes were so expensive and it would take hours to grind for a bike that is only useful for 3 or 4 missions. I would like this a lot better if the vehicles would drive more realistic and the horn would make them move over. I also wish the highway would curve or go up mountains instead of driving In a straight line. 4 stars if improved.', ""I like this game but read my dislikes first. Before you download this, read this comment. Once your on level 7 it takes ages to complete the level. I got over 35,000 trophies on this level(forever mode), and I didn't even finish 3 quarters of the level yet! And now onto the controls. So unintelligent! When you get the horn control, and you beep at someone,it takes like over 5 seconds for them to move when you are going over 130mph"", ""Game is good if you want adrenaline rush. But the reason why I am giving it 4 stars is because if you don't want to spend real money in this game then it gets real tough and tiresome after Mission 29 (when you will probably reach Level 21) because you just can't collect that much cash needed to get a new bike unless you are willing to put hours and hours in this game which is not worth it. So it's fun only upto Mission 29 and after that you can just leave this game to save time. Try it !!!"", 'The game is good no doubt. But in my opinion, the way you doubles the score when we are in our opposing lane in wrong. About 92% players are teens or kids and this rule that gives us double score may affect them in a negative manner. Children learn 70% from their surrounding and from this game they would learn that breaking rules is good. I know you would say that this game is for enjoyment but you should realize that it may affect our future generations. So I request you to make changes.Thanks', ""The best driving game I've ever played! The graphics are so good that you feel like you're really riding a real motorcycle.

Tilt suddenly stops working and every time when i open game i have to calibrate the device for playing and when i completed a mission and start a new mission tilt doesn't work and i checked my gyroscope in other games but gyroscope working well only this game is doing this thing hope you fix it soon.

I felt like I was actually having a lot of fun on android game. Sadly after some progress the game doesn't allow me to go forward because my cars arent fast enough and guess how I can make them faster? Yep you guessed it! Spend $$$ on gold to buy parts. Just another one of the bunch I guess. If you want to add in-game purchases thats fine. But don't stop me from progressing or enjoying the game. If you play against other players to get parts they're ll gods"", 'Love the game. Wonderful, just wanna make continual updates to my review. The last big update annoyed me a little because one of the car blueprint leveles was changed but whatever, time moves on. The lunar new year update was great and I loved the map looks, but now... the music. Jesus. I hear the same three songs on repeat all the time. I dont hate the music but, come on, variety PLEASE! Still a great game though.', ""Useless, rigged so you can advance only if you pay, can't win an event even if you win all the time because they don't give enough races to you ,only one every 48 minutes, and you have to race again to get the PR up, and so on, and on campaing you'd have to watch so many advertisements that you'd become sick, i just got sick of it and I'll uninstall, i suggest you don't do like i did to invest time in it, and especially don't invest money as you'd only be asked for more, as it is NO LIMITS yes?"", 'This game is impossible to get very far without spending hard earned cash on gold. Initially they lull you into believing that this game actually might not be pay 2 win and can be enjoyed without spending money, but once they\'ve hooked you on the game it hits you HARD. They\'ll give you a few cars for free, or earned very easily, towards the beginning and you\'ll cruise through the first chapters of the campaign. Eventually it gets to the point where that car just doesn\'t cut it anymore and you\'ll need a new one, but good luck farming a better car because you can\'t even grind in this game without paying money. It\'s locked behind time gates that can be skipped by paying premium currency, and even if you\'re fine with that have fun trying to get the part you want. Most of the time when you replay a mission looking for a part you\'ll only get ingame cash which isn\'t very useful, besides at the very early stages. They do this same thing in ""events"" which initially are quite fun and again they lull you in thinking you won\'t need to spend money to complete the event because the first 3-4 days can be farmed. After that you CANNOT play the game enough because of all the missions you can only replace a couple times per day, which on top of the event also being timed makes it impossible to get all the parts required to upgrade the car in order to unlock the next stages. So you\'re forced to make a decision: Pay money to progress to the next stages so you can keep the car you\'ve been working to get the past week, or don\'t pay and lose all the progress you just made and through all the time you spent doing it down the drain. I\'d suggest the latter and just uninstal the game, or never play it in the first place.', 'You guys as game developers, should work on a faster start up page. For example, sometimes I only have about 5 mins to play, so when I login in it takes 5 mins to even start the game. Please work on that and as well as the clarity of cars, some cars have really bad detail and resolution!! Otherwise good job!!', 'Great game overall. Too bad it takes ages to upgrade a car. You are so limited because of the numbers of plays and also the events sucks. You get a full car only if u complete it and there is no possible way to get to the last day and finish the event without spending a lot of your gold currency. I understand the need of money...but maybe u can offer more balance for other players as well...maybe some of us cannot get the best experience out of the game because of your money hunger .', ""The game graphics are amazing and the controls 🎮 are not bad either... The only thing about this game... It's only for the rich💰... You may think of grinding but there's a fuel ⛽ system that makes it impossible to advance in the game. You can play close to an hour ⏳or less. The game play isn't ideal with hard to get blue prints. Meaning you will hit a wall pretty fast. The game isn't bad, but like I said... This game is for rich. If you have money 💵 throw around then you will enjoy the game."", ""Good graphics and gameplay do not make up for the fact this game is barely playable with the long load times, even longer wait times, and not to mention that energy bar you call a gas tank. I used to love these Need for Speed games, but, since all you soulless, money hungry developers seem INTENT on running the entire franchise into the ground, I can't take it anymore. I hope you had fun ruining everything for me personally, but I'm DONE with Need for Speed. Entirely. TO HELL WITH EA."", 'This game is good in graphic. But to many problem.. It takes to much time to login n you will need to download 441 mb for resource and its not offline.. And you can play 10 matches only and you need to wait for the nxt few hours to play.. Biggest problem it tekes way to much time to login of your connection is not so good.. Its better to ply fortnight or pubg.. Instead of trying to login.. This stupid game.. My biggest mistake waiting for 20 kin for this game to login.', ""Now I'm playing this game on my galaxy s10 and it's amazing. The graphics, stability and gameplay experience is awesome. I've played it for over a year now and still love it, especially when I have a tuned car. But the only thing I dont like is that you can't race friends online. 1 on 1 racing with people you know would be awesome. Food for thought EA!"", 'Its so hard to upgrade & rebuild parts if you don\'t plan to purchase gold. What\'s more frustrating is you can\'t tap the desired option at the mystery prize segment. So I can\'t proceed with challenges. So I bought some gold and faithfully stayed the course to try and get a fast car in the ""undercover challenge"" but its wishful thinking to do it if. The time period is just too short. Regrettably, I am going to uninstall the game so that I do not lose my sanity. Really disappointed.', ""Very good game, although since the last update i am losing many of the races because at a point when i am in the race and drifting, the car crashes in the wall and can't take it out until I shake my phone a little bit....and also, it would be better if the parts were cheaper...so you don't have to race 1000times the same race to get the part that you need or to make money to buy them...at some point it gets boring"", '2stars due to the name of this need for speed was unlimited. But was highly disappointed to know there are limits on the races you can join, limits on the qualification power for each race, limits on how many races you can repeat, limits on the mod parts you can buy daily. Basically there limits on everything you do. So exactly what is the unlimited part for?', ""This game have been frustrating me for the past few days. For me to access other events, I was told to download the full game (which by the way cost a little over 700mb, add that to the 1.6gb used to download the game) and twice I was told to update the game (also cost 400mb each) which I've done. All in all, the game cost me a little short of 3gb. And this morning I woke up and I can't even access the game, the screen shows that I've to download the full game. THIS GAME SUCKS!!!"", ""Awesome game. All you gotta do is take it one step at a time. You cant expect to catch up to people who's had this game for years if you've only started playing it. Just have fun and alot of patience. EA, y'all doing a great job out here. Started playing FIFA recently too. WELL DONE GUYS. CANT GET ENOUGH. ITS A MUST DOWNLOAD."", 'I like the game it had a good story the game keeps the player hooked but when doing the events i think like theres not enough time to complete the events and the the amount of tickets the player has are very important in playing the events and the amount of time need to wait for the tickets is too long I recommend you make the events worth the time to play and instead of it being not possible to win.', 'Curious, when you complete a weekly campaign and all the funding that is used is considered ""Loan"". Why is it not giving me back my loaned gold bars? When you go to the Lunar store and use gold and it says ""Loan"" next to the amount of bars required for purchase. Yet, at the completion of the series. E.g. UnderCover. I am not returned my gold bars. Can you advise please. Like and share this post if you have noticed it and want feedback. Thanks', ""A beautiful game with amazing graphics but all of that is ruined by the pay-to-win mechanics. Once you get past the introductory part of the game where game play and advancement is easy and free, you're faced with the choice between grinding through race after race to try to earn parts, or paying cash. And not small cash either - I estimate it would cost $30-50 to fully upgrade a single car, and there are dozens of cars in the game. Uninstalling!"", ""Takes waaaayyyyyyy too long to get upgrades that are worth while for cars without spending money. Im on chapter 8, took a month to get a car upgraded enough to make it to the boss. Now who knows how long it'll take to upgrade to actually race the boss. Maybe a year? If it takes much longer Im just gonna uninstall."", 'The game is not bad but it needs work ""alot"" of it, controls are useless and it seems the game can\'t be simple it\'s always pestering you to do drifts, life\'s not all about drifts! Another flaw is always unlock this, and unlock that! the need for speed I knew and grew up with from under ground was simple, this game however expects alot of effort for nice cars and something not worth it, I don\'t recommend this to anyone, I thought I\'d like it, but after 2 days, lost interest...', ""Everything is just awesome. But we just only have a one problem. i.e : while playing in tilt mode after the reputation level increases to 25, i have a serious issue of the tilt control setting, i have been playing this game in tilt mode since i started to play.

Thisis such a wonderful game,so don't lose ur worth"", ""This would've gotten 5 starts. It got 4, because of the length of the races. The races are too short even when you're competing against others. That's my only problem. Apart from that, it's a great game, it runs smooth, the music is great and the graphics and cars arenon point."", ""Got to PAY to make the top tiers in this game. Should be branded as pay to play. I've been trying to complete a challenge for weeks now, my car is more than up to the task however it's dark, hard to see and oncoming traffic makes it IMPOSSIBLE to get any further. I play games for fun and competition, this is NEITHER and so is getting UNINSTALLED! I do NOT Recommend this game to anyone who does not want to put money into it because past a certain point you can't go on without paying!"", ""Great game but you don't get a realistic chance of getting the loaner vehicle because of the time frame. The event is over 5-6 days and the first day takes up 2 days and each day after is one day of trying to gather enough materials to rank up high enough for the next race. Overall great game great graphics."", ""This game looks absolutely stunning. The wet surfaces make everything reflective and the textures look incredible, the detail is great and the cut scenes don't look like trash. But the gameplay experience is just garbage. Only control over the car is the steering, which is clearly very assisted. There's no accelerate or brake. No support for gamepads. The UI looks like a generic zombie ftp trash game. And the micro transactions are extremely annoying. Just make this again, but not crappy."", ""It's a great game but it's not good that each 3-4 weeks to have an update, that we already did it from Google play, and to enter the game and have an additional of 1 GB to download it!! And if we have an internet corruption, we should go back to download from 0!!! Isn't proper at all. After multi try to download and after, finally, that 1 GB downloaded, still have to download an additional 17 mb, which I send you mails with screenshots and you didn't respond to any, that they can't be download"", ""Overall decent game, but I wish dev's would revise the underground rival pairing logic. There's no reason I should be in the 3rd tier (c) with 440pr and racing people with over 600pr. Maybe in tier A but even that should be matched with people in your class. Be prepared to never move beyond tier D or C in these worthless races, no matter how many shots you give it. Who knows, maybe if you max the cars out you'll have a shot, but otherwise, dont expect much out of those races."", ""Revised: Everything is working well on it, quite pleased that you can spend little money and take a break from spending any for a few months with still a lot to do. Game has a lot to offer for free unlike many other mobile games in it's class. I'd be interested in seeing an additional mode for quickplay multiple car racing. As an easy means to do dailies and remove repetitiveness."", ""It's a really good game and can become a real Need for speed game. On the go what we all want is freeroam our phones are clearly capable of running freeroam our phones are faster than the PSP that can run racing games have a a big freeroam map like Midnight Club 3 that can easily be run in the psp with no issues even though the graphics are lower with a lower resolution. But phones can do alot now this game has been the same for years something big needs to happen to this game."", ""NFS still the best car racing game on earth!! The game perfectly enjoyable like the old PC version.. here's my review that EA should do next: 1. Add dashboard view mode 2. Make more laps race (1-3) 3. Subscription privilege (like pubg, and others..) 4. Multiplayer PvP ranked team & solo mode (underground still far matched the cars rating) 5. You figure out.."", ""It's done well and plays well!!. My complaint is with the time it takes to progress through the game (without buying gold). Numerous times I've started a race for a chance to get blueprints but once it's over the blueprint isnt even an option like it's supposed to be!!! Wouldn't recommend if you don't want to spend (a lot) of actual real money (parts get stupid expensive pretty quick)"", ""been playing this game for more than a year and its really awesome. love the layout and graphics but for the bit of special events its very disappointing. don't see why it takes almost 8 parts to get 1 single PR boost, surely it can be brought down to atleast 2 parts for a PR boost, give some chance of winning some of the nice cars, for us that don't do in-app purchase. other than that awesome game."", ""Really good but the only thing I would change is maybe your energy/fuel cap went up every 2nd level.This game is easy to get the hang of but grinding for gear at a low level for a high star car is hard (kinda obvious though). I had a complete starred car (I don't know as I started new) but I had low prestige (the stars were 5 or above) and because it was a pretty advanced car but my prestige was trash it took me forever to finally be able to start accessing the gear I needed to keep upgrading."", 'Overall good game, but recent updates were a disaster. Persisting connection issues in PvP mode when connected to WiFi (can only play one race at a time). Mandatory advertisements then taking forever to reconnect. It seems like every update introduces another problem that remains unsolved. I know have to force stop the app and clear the cache just to be able to log in', ""The game is absolutely addictive BUT it's disappointing when it comes to the Rival Racing Campagain, the screening does NOT pick the right opponent with the same PR, or at least same wave. Makes it useless to know how good you are if your opponent is waaay over than you. I suggest, allow players to compete with the same PR wave, see who really have what it takes."", ""Updated review, the EA company doesn't care as usual about how the consumer feels. Oneplus 6T still has problems after OS 10 update and there no fixing of bugs, the special event races gets difficult even when you devote more than the usual time, and even gold rewards, one don't still get the reward of a loaned car. The final PR is always too high with the time frame and amount game played."", ""4Stars!!! Pretty good game, the race track is a little short and not enough jumps turns and action as very first race @ the beginning of the game other than that it's a kick ass game graphics, controls, cars, gameplay, story line could be better also. But I'm constantly playing it so it must be good."", ""Not a fan of huge car garages. Never was. I always liked 1 car I could put my all into but that's me. Didn't like: BluePrint concept was dumb (get random BPs; all cars got 15-40 parts so to build a car, gotta be lucky, I got Hoonicorn Mustang). Parts too expensive, not all cars have same upgrades, drift controls sometimes suck, & you can only re-race certain races a set # of times. Which means upgrading all cars w/o ya money is impossible. EDIT: 02182020: Bored. Ya game cheats players. I'm done."", ""Way to many different menus. Gold bars, cash, fuel, car upgrades, car blueprints parts for the cars. The list goes on much longer. I just want to race but then I have upgrade the car for no reason besides the game forcing you to upgrade. It's a pain. Also the races are on the short side. I spent more time getting parts then actual racing. The races are all point to point races and they are short. The game does look good."", ""It's developers really shined in Real Racing 3, and this game is a far cry from that game in any way. The controls feel clunky, not even coming close to the similarly freemium Asphalt games. On top of that, the first thing the game throws at you is a lootbox before you can even race your first race, and after the first chapter it doesn't seem to get any better. For your own sake, just play Real Racing 3, Asphalt 8 (or 9), or if you can, Most Wanted for mobile. There are better ways to waste time""]"

RACING IS NOT, I REPEAT, NOT, ABOUT JUST GETTING TO THE FINISH!!!! Racing is about racing everyone else to the finish. Ok, so I lost. I STILL GOT TO THE FINISH, THANK YOU!! And then I win, and it tells me that I managed to get to the finish. Well......OBVIOUSLY, I mean, I won the race....... Let\'s just make it say: ""you won the race"" or ""you were beaten"". OK?', 'WOW! This has got to be tHe best racing car app. that I, personally, have ever played! The choices and freedom that you have during gameplay is exceptional. The controls are accurate and precise. The graphics are unbelievably HD. I am really impressed! Keep up the fantastic work, guys! (A Google user)', 'Great game until chapter 10. Once you hit chapter 10 you must either have been fortunate enough to have all the pieces to the ""Rider M4"", (which are from random loot chests), or spend money to buy a car in that classification. The gameplay is good, only minor glitches especially if your car gets any kind of air. The upgrade system works well, and does make a difference when racing other drivers. A.I. rivals are good. Overall a decent game until you hit chapter 10.', ""I think the game is pretty good until you get half way through the story, then you pretty much have to spend money or grind for very long time in order to continue playing because can only used specific cars that can't be bought with in game cash. Also, can't open any chests from multiplayer rewords, some kind of bug I guess. Tried contacting developers several times via email and got no response..."", 'Fun game and a great time passer. No real need to spend $ if patient. Graphics are nice and controls are easily mastered with some practice. Fun challenges and campaign. A cool feaure to add would be the ability to sell previously owned vehicles at 3/4 to 1/2 the price along with some extra credits for the upgrades purchased. Also I feel that playing chicken with oncoming traffic should earn a few more risk points than in the proper lane. But over all a great game.', ""It's a great game but I have found to sync games to different devices you have to take the auto-stync off and do it manually its a pain, but it's worth it once you have a bunch of cars but overall a very fun game on a side note you need to preread your story line so many inconsistencies and spelling you spell Stacie 2 different ways referring to the same person Stacy/Stacie lol it is fun game though lol"", ""Edit: THE NEW UPDATE IS HORRIBLE!!! Supply rewards are stuck on 1250. Found out you need gold to continue in career. Physics are off now. Orginal review right before the horrible update: PERFECT!!! If you like racing games, definitely download this one. Balanced physics, great graphics, fair rewards for upgrades. The English is a little off, but it's almost makes me enjoy it more lol. Not overbloated and its overall well balanced. Very satisfied, great replayability."", ""This is a good game, but the physics suck, sometimes it's made impossible to beat a race and the constant adds and asking for ratings are annoying. I understand adds, but do you have to ask for a rating every 5 minutes. (Btw) the oldman is very fast, but if I go from flat to down hill and catch any amount of air going above 115 mph the car freaks out and spends the next 30 seconds rolling and crashing."", 'The game is very nice and easy to play but I\'m pleading with the developer to do some changes in some of the ""Chapters"" that has ""Clean Drive"". It is the difficult part in it and I have about 33 friends that are currently stucked at ""Chapter 5"" and can\'t move on just because of the ""Clean Drive""😭😭 which makes us loose intrest in the game. Please if the developer is reading this, he should kindly change it to either ""Race"" or ""Knockout"" for us in his next Update Please!!🙏🙏', 'great game with pretty good graphics but can you implement a free roam mode and fix the ""australian highway"" map because in australia its left hand traffic but ingame its right hand traffic. I\'m also not sure how im supposed to use the police trim on my car. I enable it, then i go do an event and its stock.', 'Game is superb.But I noticed that whenever I play this game my phone temperature rises upto 41 degrees causing overheating pls look into this I am sincere about this issue.And it seems that the issue started with this latest version of the game because I never experienced this in the previous versions.Also I feel that the event mode that you added to the game In this recent version is not interesting,I feel you would have added a mode that is more appealing, like formula one type of racing mode.', 'Fun game, ads appear a lot in menu, even after I did a subscription. Will remove subscription, but keep playing, just have to wait for fuel to refill. Dropping a star the more I play. Multi-player rewards not given after last season. No response from bug. Some glitches in races, the roadster likes to do flips on any of the hills and there are times when the cars will not steer after bumping opponent or rails.', 'The first 4 chptrs are fun, after that payouts never meet cost upgrades.

About ten races in, there's a timed race you can't win even if you race perfectly, the car isn't fast enough, and there's no way to earn money to upgrade it (besides paying real money, of course - which seems to be the point). Limited races, mediocre graphics. There are plenty of better choices."", 'Its a good game but whenever i hit the fence on the side of the track, it makes me fall through the world. also, whenever i finish the race, the race progress thing still says 99%, and the ""FINISHED!"" bar doesn\'t pop up, AND it makes me keep driving. eventually, it makes me fall out of the world. I already tried reporting this as a bug, but i didn\'t get a reply.', 'I really enjoy this game and find it a really good time waster. The controls and graphics are great. I\'ve made it through the first two sections but I have noticed a problem. On the final race of the second section the guy your racing against says he bets his car that he\'ll win the race (the cars name was ""Wrestler""). I won all 3 races, yet I didn\'t get the car. Is this a bug or did I just read it wrong?', ""This game is amazing, definitely the best game I've downloaded this year. The controls are perfect the graphics is great they storyline is awesome, as if the game isn't perfect enough you can also play it offline, what else can I ask for lol. Yall should definitely guve it a try I promise you will get hooked."", ""Not bad. Graphics are sufficient and good. Sounds fit with the cars. Behaviour of the cars are remarkable good. Occasionally a pop up with an add. Almost no downside. Of course thete are. The cost of the upgrades compared to the winnings. Maybe take a look at that because it doesn't feel fair. Overall a good game. Worth playing. For me a keeper for now."", ""I've played this game a year ago till now, I like this game, but the new update is very bad, you've remove the unique box rewards in mono races. boxes, cars & update parts now become more expensive. you've added only one story in campaign, I've lost my profile pic, rating & position in multi-player. when I bump into another car, my car turns over, & reset button has removed so I need to wait a few sec. To return again. also my car isn't reach the max. speed in multi-player. Plz fix this issues."", ""I hate this game! You need fuel to play a level! You only add that because you wanna get some money, the game is not worth it to buy premium. and the controls is the problem too, there is no wheel steer only arrows and tilt. Please remove the fuel thing and add something in the controls, this game would've been great to be honest, I'm uninstalling this game. This game is just a money grabber."", 'Ever since the latest update, there are soo many things off with the game. Seasons were introduced into multiplayer (which is not really multiplayer since you can actually pause the game and are racing some AI ghosts!?), but nothing works. Firstly, there are meant to be progress rewards which the game says you earned but you never get them. Secondly, Season 1 was supposed to end 4 says ago but was prolonged for another 5 days without explanation. Now it has ended, but it is still ongoing!?', ""Like the game ok, but it's a pay to win type game with lots of ads, had alot of time invested to build my money up and then the latest update came along (which is not an upgrade but a downgrade from previous version) and somehow all my money I had saved up is now gone. I don't even want to play anymore after that if I have to start saving all over. So what would have been a 4-5 star game is now a 1 star. Sorry"", 'The game is good in low size. Nice graphics. But this game is not so challenging at all. Please add free roaming option to let us explore the world your team made. In free roam option cops chasing and other things need to be added. Only just racing is not a good idea. The graphics needs a little more details and quality upgrade. Thank you', ""You guys did a great job on the game 👍👏. I really enjoy the pace of it, the online mode, and the career track. Plus I have fun with the upgrades and tuning up the car. What I think your team could improve on is the multiplayer online should be player vs player instead of running against timed opponents who are not online at that moment. I'll recommend it to my friends and see how they like it 😉"", 'YOU WILL NOT WIN THE 4TH RACE OF CHAPTER 2 ! This is a great game the graphics to game play is amazing BUT! at chapter 2 the 4th race is almost impossible to complete your oppents cars are indestructible yet one slight touch from their car and your car is completely wasted! Yet my car is the mercedes the highest rank 2 car there is! Please sort that out', ""I would really give this game 5 stars because the graphics and control and gameplay is really cool but I gave 4 stars because the car's name are not real but the car's looks like the real life cars but no problem . Good 🙂 . Keep up the good work . Thanks for reading my review ."", ""Massive money pit. Progress is systematically blocked because of the fuel system and the fact that each level restricts you to slower cars, so that you cannot pass the level without paying for upgrades. Basically you cannot save up and buy a faster car to pass the level as you won't be allowed to use that faster car to pass lower levels. This is an incredibly crappy thing to do as it ruins gameplay completely. Update restricts you to certain cars only for each chapter, no choice. Awful."", 'Game is pretty well made, my problem is I paid $3 to max out my favorite car, (transatlantic) which is a class 1, to a rating of 419, but when I was racing with other 419 rated cars, I always lost, no matter how well I raced. Paid $3 to barely improve the car but you cant remove your upgrades to play with cars on your level, so basically I paid money to race cars better than my car and loose.', 'These genius game developers made a fantastic game and then out of nowhere threw in a nearly impossible level (clean drive - chapter 5) and absolutely sabotaged their own efforts. This was a 5 star game for me before coming upon this ridiculousness. If you enjoy investing a lot of time into a game only to in the end walk away from it feeling betrayed and disappointed, then this is the game for you.', 'Good game with alot of offline choices as well as online options. Well worth downloading and its compact filing doesnt use up much memory storage. Good graphics, put your own styles too it and your set to enjoy a well presented. Racer.', ""Pretty cool game, I really love it but they need to fix the physics of some cars because they bounce like a ball when they jump and it's pretty frustrating... I don't give it 5 stars because of that."", 'Great game love the graphics but you can do beter on it with voice commentary while driving from passing cars or racers in other cars and aswell with light damage to the vehicles and where you pa for repair to vehicles beter music options and upgrades to the car self like wheels spoilers bodykits roofracks or sunroofs and more but other then that love the game keeps me busy daily and put maps on aswell in driving mode pls thanx alot guys', 'Best Highway Game I have ever played. The graphics 👌👌... game play is also on point... I love how you can move the controls to be how you want them to be... Cars are affordable. THE BEST PART of this game is the LONG DRIVE...😋😋 damn... well done to the developers and I hope you will continue creating such games. This is the best game thus far for me in 2020', 'hey this game is great, nice performance, great grapics, great physics, and great ui. no annoying 3 days long tutorial l witch is great. but the thing that bothers me the most is the speed sensation is too low. to improove that you could make the lines on the street smaller, and put wind effects (like the og need for speed most wanted) and shake the camera a little (like forza)', ""You guys did a very good job ! This game is almost comparable to need for speed no limits ! The story is very fruitful,I am very sure that this game is underrated and also I'll recommend this game to people who wants to play some street racing games with cops etc. Graphics is also quite decent ! Not too bad ! 😉"", ""The game is definitely good....it has amazing graphics.The problem found is that when it reaches to some point it hangs and never loads completely though i downloaded it for the second time hope it doesn't hang again...This is the second time I'm downloading it so you can just guess how good it is😍"", ""Chapter 5 Clean drive is almost impossible to pass. It being the only clean drive in the main campaign, and me already completing all of the long drives and spending all of the money on cars, mainly my r34 Skyline. Wish I could sell my cars, haven't ever had a problem with fuel in the game."", 'Absolut rubbish, cars fly even if it touchs anothr car in same lane, gameplay is worst, ux is just lyk anyothers, in app purchase do not disable ad though it claims to be, controls dont work or false control happens most the time, a hard race becomes very easy if u try 3 4 tyms, visible change in traffic can be felt if u try the 4th tym, hitting side rails in parallel would cause the car to somersault 3 4 tyms..absolute dump physics, easy drive ft: a blind can drive better than this, garbage!!!!', 'Good game but would be better if the designers could make slamming into guardrails in curves less advantageous. I try to take the turns cleanly (you know...with skill) and other drivers pass me by slamming into them. Is that the goal of the game? To slam into rails and get ahead of others? Also, too many times other cars speed off ahead of me before my throttle or nitrous even engagea. Fix these two bugs and you have a really good game.']"

- Various bug fixes","[""Takes a long time to upgrade your cars, to the point where you just give up. The bots that you race will cheat to keep your progress very slow. You can see the physics change between you and the bots. Upgrades don't seem to make a big difference. Don't waste your data watching ads for anything as the 'rewards' are minimal. Other than that, it's ok!"", ""This game is addictive but it takes too much grinding. If you decrease the price of all items (those that cost gems or coins) by 95%, I will add 2 more stars. But keep up the good work and I hope you add more adventure maps, cups and vehicles. I'd like to suggest though, when watching replays, maybe make the music faster when the playback speed of the replay is increased and vice versa."", 'I enjoy this game. It\'s by no means a ""simulator"" but there is a lot you can do in it and they stay somewhat appoaching the realm of keeping with the laws of physics. I\'d like to maybe see them steer (pun intended) away from the extra stupid cars like a vespa or a segway... I mean why not a clown on a unicycle holding a confetti cannon? jk. Please don\'t do that, FS.', ""The cup game mode is how you unlock new stuff. At first, it's way too easy, but at some point the difficulty just spikes, making it almost impossible to continue. It's not even fun difficult either, since the AI drivers blatantly cheat. Their cars are so much faster, that it's impossible to win (even if you drive perfectly), except if the AI dies. That's not fun and probably a way to get you to spend real money to upgrade your cars faster."", 'Spend coins on a car by winning 3 races that last roughly a minute each,watch advert to open a chest,upgrade car by watching advert.Save coins for upgrades. Upgrade car only to find the game has out tiered your car. There are lots of vehicles to choose from or collect?Dont bother collecting them,they cost millions of coins to upgrade,stick to 1 car and it takes forever to upgrade... Gets pretty tedious pretty quick.', 'Nice and funny game. Great graphics. Feeling like you are in a funny cartoon. Beautiful and charming animation. What is bad - customer support is almost non-existing - I lost my phone and all my progres disapired on new instalation, so I asked for help. No answer 10 days... still nothing. After 3 months - still no answer...', ""I'm getting tired of this game. Its very hard to collect resources and advance your vehicles. But the most disturbing aspect is trying to build your own team. I've been trying for over a year and I can't find good players. This developer needs to change algorithms to allow new teams to develop and grow. I'm a high level player and very frustrated."", 'After playing HCR1, this is a big time improvement better graphics, sound, playability etc. However this game is let down by slow response time and not fixing faults that i have reported over 5 times now, also in game costs are expensive, to unlock cars and some scrappage part costs are unbeleivable, its defenatly pay to win, i know the makers should get money for there efforts but, reduce in game prices and my stars will go up.', ""I purchased the premium pack for £4.49...the only offer at that price ...I didnt recieve the offer listed so contacted their so called support 4 days later after providing them with all the purchase information including a screenshot of my purchase of £4.49 they responded ...you must have bought another offer... There are no other offers at that price....I'm still waiting but I dought I will see my account correctly provided with what I've paid for....All in all a bad experience from them..."", 'Great game, but seriously... the bosses are way too hard. Every season I lose like 10 times to the bosses before I can miraculously beat them. And my rally car and its parts are maxed. Edit: so I just raced my first boss in the new season, and the boss only had a hill climber mk2 (one of the first cars). Very happy about this. The bosses should get harder as you get a higher rank, not start out impossible. Thank you! 😁 Also, I love the team races, they make the slower cars relevant again.', ""You can't play with any lesser vehicles, because you always get placed against the best vehicles in the game, regardless of what you want to play with. Which makes you always lose if you are not playing with the best vehicles yourself. Why is it so hard to get matched accordigly based on your vehicle and upgardes? This is rodiculous and lousy. You want to charge people with 20 euro for some pathetic cosmetics for the vehicles, make us watch 20 commercials, but u cant do a proper matchnaking!"", 'Seems to be going backwards. The latest in a long line of problems is since updating to Android 10 the game lags pretty badly but if you turn off the sound it runs smoothly again. Fingersoft have recently introduced a number of ""anti cheating"" measures one was that offline kms no longer count towards the team chest and most recently they\'ve capped the km contribution to 1000km per player. Is Fingersoft\'s only anti cheating strategy to punish legit players?????', ""It doesn't really matter how much time you spend updating vehicles, winning races, or doing events. Everything is rigged for you to get the least for what costs the most. The scrap bs is exactly that bs-doesn't make your vehicle strong just makes it take longer to undate. The power ups don't get any better either. The adventure boards are truly where you see how gd the vehicles could be but during events, races and such - you're going to be frustrated. I've paid money to pay & it's justShitty"", ""Ads only get worse. As you can't even close them at times after you've watched. When it comes to unlocking it will take you years. Pay to win or stick with the same vehicle. There's never player va player it is all ghost records you challenge. I guess this was only a clever idea to play without connection problems or lag, I remember those days racing with all much lag since most generally phone connection are so slow right now at times."", 'Uses location for ads without permission. I have been a fan of Hill climb racing and have spent real money in the game. I understand ads are a part of the business model and have watched many for the perks of the game. However, I started receiving ads taloired to the location I have traveled to and feel my privacy is totally violated. I have granted no permissions and my location is turned off. I do no support invasive and intrusive ads nor businesses that sell and violate my privacy.', 'A majority of the time, I don\'t get to use the ""watch a video"" for my three hour chests and that\'s just really annoying. It makes me play less because I\'m getting so little for what I\'m doing in gameplay. This happens every other update and then there isn\'t an update to fix it for months. Please fix it.', ""This used to be a great game, but it is steadily becoming worse and worse. Latest updates just mess up things. The new layout is confusing and pointless. Ads are longer and longer. Forced updates all the time! Customer support is quite poor. The info isn't up to date and still old bugs exist. Awful splash noise! Boss levels in the cups are artificial and very annoying. I spent some time reading other reviews and I see others hate the boss races too - please remove them! Do you care?"", ""Pedal lag, ads that force-quit the game, terrible matchmaking, inconsistent physics. That's minus three stars. Here's one star for nice art style and another for being able to earn premium currency in decent quantities without spending real money. All in all, this game is fine. Try it yourself, but keep in mind, that it is quite different from HCR 1."", 'Finger soft has an unclear and ambiguous policy, banning accounts without assigning any reason, proof and without any notice or information.

Fix the game you fools. This game's car upgrades are all over the shop. Some upgrades make some cars better (Dune Buggy & tank) while others actually make the car worse in terms of control (Dragster truck, Superbike & more). Their p2w chests are a joke. Want an upgrade for a certain car?? GTFO. You can get endless repeats for your scooter. Dodgy devs and game."", ""Edit* This seems to have been fixed now. I'm getting a different level every time. Thanks for the update. (Original post) Was having a great time until it gets stuck giving you the same level like 30 times in a row. ( Haven't actually counted but, if i continue to get rocky road cup I'm gonna go insane.)"", 'Great game but the only issue i have is that why is it when i win 1st place in a race all 3 times that it says i get the gold trophy and 350 points right? but it will only give me sometime only like 120-160. never more than like 200. and it also says if you get 3 rd place its suppose to give you 50+ points but it will actually take away about 75-150.... and if i loose itll take about 200-220 away. ive won probably about 1500 races this season alone and ive barely got 84000 points.', ""Been playing for a long time. Always been a great game, it's now clearly an app trying to pump out as much money as possible. The events which is the fun stuff, you're expected every month or 'season' to pay for the premium pass. That's mental. I would happily pay a fee in a once off deal, but not all of us can afford monthly bills on an app to enjoy your game. It is advertised as a free app. Greedy and very much pay to win now. Damn shame cause it was fun while it lasted for my partner and I."", ""Just awesome all round game, and adding team mode was best thing ever. Only thing i dont like is the scrap, cause those legendary parts take alot. Wouln't be so bad if had way to earn more scrap maby random in chest or something like that. Iv been playing this game 3years and its still my favorite, iv earned my 6140 garage power iv got now and still approving it day by day. I have bought few the 9.99$ skin and paint packages, and do keep VIP for no ads and double points in public event."", ""Don't purchase anything. I purchased the premium pass after a day some bug removed it from my account. I have the receipt and screenshots. Opened a support case. Coincidentally they have a default option for this exact issue!!!! Nothing was done. Opened a second case. Again, nothing! Very frustrating the service is non-existent. I will contact Google to refund the transaction."", 'Love, love , love the game. It is so much fun. I am not happy about what has happened several weeks ago. My husbands account and my account were merged because he used my device for contacting FS trying to recover his progress. I lost several hundreds of hours and purchases. I have not had any response to repeated attempts to get answers. I would need to start over from the beginning I guess?', ""I've played this game for a while and built up the supercar almost to the maximum attributes.. this is the only game I have EVER seen where the faster you get the worse off you are. Because this car is so fast I hit things and flip immediately and can't correct it even with roll cage.. Why make fast cars suffer after all the work put in? Times on average are 2 seconds slower because I almost never get clean runs anymore!!!! A racing game punishes a person for being too fast!!?"", ""Fun for a while, but then the completely broken matchmaking system ruins everything. Eventually you race against the best times of other players with more upgrades than you, and every upgrade you add just makes it worse. Be prepared to watch several hours of progress vanish, because the game penalizes you if you can't win these impossible matches."", ""This is such a fun game, I will always play it, but I'm giving it 4 stars because in the higher cups there are a few poorly designed levels and with a certain level of mods it causes you to lose the race from hitting certain things on the map and bad angles and causing you to flip over or get stuck so you can't move. Oh and if you don't win cups after diamond you back track in points which is hard. Other then that it's a great game"", ""This game was one of the most best games on Google play but sadly a major flaw has run through this game. When you race sometimes it's impossible to beat them. 1: you are racing against bots 2:unfair matching against opponents But I think it's number one. Also to advance through the game you need a lot of patience. What I mean by this is that the game is extremely slow and forces you to pay to win. And those are the reasons why this ruined the game for me, thank you And please change it."", ""To kill time it's nice game, i wouldn't mind investing a bit to buy premium pass but the support service is really sucks. It has been a week since i filed a complaint and a report not getting the reward as the pass offered. The promise is, will respond at least 3 working-days, no? Well it's been 2 3 work-days for me. If you really need that kind of money, sure just take it. I don't care anymore. Thanks for killing the mood."", ""Not the worst not the best. Should be about 4 stars. However, gas pedal not functioning properly (won't stay pressed down) causes race losses, which in the case of boss races actually causes a LOSS in progress. Until it's fixed and functioning correctly, - 2 stars from it's potential rating."", ""Fun at first, but gets old fast. The only thing that is new every week or so is the team vs team events. Besides that, its grind away at the same boring cups, same boring tracks and same insanely boring adventure modes. It's just repetitive on a massive scale. Had the game 2 months or so, suprised it lasted that long on my phone, will be gone as soon as I'm done typing this review."", ""I've been playing Hill climb for years and I still think it's the best! It's been copied so many times and still the original is King. Plus I've contacted the folks at noodlecake and they are wonderful as well. A great team and a great game. The superdiesel truck looks almost exactly like my own pickup truck too!!! I'm going to ask the noodlecake team to make me a nice big sticker of their superdiesel truck I can purchase and put in the back window of my truck. Can't wait for it!!!"", ""It's a great game. I would rate more, but there's a glitch: whenever I am holding down the gas pedal, the game randomly acts like I let up sometimes. Like as if I'm still not holding down the gas pedal. Then I end up crashing because of the game. If you could please fix this, I will give it a 5-star rating. Otherwise, I love the new updates and the gameplay is amazing."", 'Developers are cruel and incompetent. Recently they have blocked hundreds of accounts ( some with more than 3 years worth of hard work ) all because they are extremely incompetent in detecting few cheaters in the game, This is the worst possible policy a game developer can come up with. I have canceled the VIP subscription and uninstalled the game.', 'Great game. Much more content than the first game and better content too! My only criticism is that its offline play is quite boring and repetitive but I understand that as it is meant to be an online game!!! Very good, just add a little more to offline.', ""It had ads, most games do. It isn't overdone BUT it takes control of the sound and interrupts when I am listening to music. This should be fixed. It should be enough for you to make me see ads not take my sound away as well. You still get paid. Good game."", ""Events are stupid now. It's bad enough to make , what could have been a fun side game, into an infuriatingly impossible to win exercise. But now the prizes are so stupid and insignificant, on top of being out of reach, that the entire point of it is lost. Also, the water levels are terrible and everybody hates them.""]"

Great intro to the Hot Wheels world. I played the game first then started collecting Hot Wheels die-cast cars. Trying to collect all the cars in this game. Nothing like playing it on the phone then picking up the real thing and re-living the action with a Hot Wheels die-cast.', 'I highly recommend it because it has so many levels and cars to collect plus theres daily race of which is hard at start you get the hang of it, the only thing that a pain is in the last section you have to have 140 stars to unlock and you have like 115 star so it take a long time to unlock. I would love it if they added more levels to it though cause its so adicive (in the good way) hoped this helped but DOWNLOAD it for sure!', ""Interesting game. BUT WOULD YOU PLS REMOVE ADS THAT APPEAR WHEN YOU ARE ABOUT TO START A STAGE SOMETIMES? It's too distracting and puts me off my momentum. I would have given a higher rating if not for this. I understand that putting ads is one way for you to earn but don't let them show up during inappropriate time."", ""Really good fun and challenging game. Massively let down by 35 seconds of adverts popping up for every 1-2 minutes of game play!! I know free to play games need to be supported by ads but it's a bit ridiculous to have so many and such long interruptions to the game play."", ""It's a fun game, sometimes hard, but fun. But for some reason I can't purchase cars or coins. I wanted to unlock one of the cars and after I selected my card (tried a several cards) and clicked on the 1-tap-pay and the screen went a bit darker but nothing happened."", ""Awesome.Game I love it the cool thing is if it's on tablet or phone you will get very less hacker's will acur way less also Dune It Up is awesome to same with Roger Dodger, 24 Ours and Street Creeper . It's like the best game ever since 2016!"", '3 stars because I have played this game before on my phone and it was a bit hard but if you play it more and more it is prety good. But on my phone playing it I was stuck on a level for atleast a month but thats only my opion try it for your self and who knows people with bad rewiews could be lying or it might be the toaltly oposite way people only rate it 5 stars so you can waste your time playing a stupid game. So you decide is it rubish or is it FABULARS!', 'I love Hot Wheels, this game is challenging and fun for the most part! Upon opening this game to play, mine would barely show any loading animation for the shark car and stopped fully opening after a few attempts to play again, so I uninstalled. Everything was working fine at first, maybe my connection is the issue because online games usually do not work for very long on my cellphone after a while of gameplay. Still a great game, if your cellphone has a good connection and compatible. Offline', ""Video ads are timed to run just as you're about to level up. I've maxed out all cars so there's no more challenge except for multiplayer mode. Suggest that when/if all cars are maxed, allow any car to be raced on any track. I'd love to try trucks on the speed track or monster cars on the muscle car track."", ""Its alot more difficult than I expected but Im glad for this challenge. I'm impressed with the thought I have to put into how much gas to use and when the break is a good idea, the exploding can be a bit annoying when you're still figuring out tilting but otherwise, fun so far!"", 'I love this game but there are many ads by the way the graphics are super cool but there should be more cars to race with. I give this game 5 stars because of the graphics.', ""really fun game but i wish it was easier to do flips but really fun game this is the best racing game ever. Wait changed my rating because when you get to the swamp map it's really impossible like still stuck in the first level in the swamp area even with the highest level of the car. This game is only fun in the beginning"", ""Worst game ever. The cars can't for 2 seconds stay on the track and the tilting I shouldn't even go there. There's no brakes only tilting. The fuel drains even when you don't use it. The only thing that is good is the grahics but other than that it's the worst driving game I have played. If I could I would give it a 0."", ""I love this game, it's awesome, especially how the vehicles look. I would further love the game if you added more sets or sections, like monster truck vehicles, classic vehicles and so on. Keep up the good work and also make hot wheels race off 2."", ""I love this game it's fun and easy and I almost have all cars and mobile players you can just watch a ad for free gems and it will help you to get more cars with the Jem's and I'm most got all the stars four more stars and then I'm done with the levels and I can still get all the cars when im done I will start racing other people and I really like what hot wheels race off did I enjoy what they did so thanks for this game I would not play a race game when I saw this game it's fun game thx"", 'Difficulty is even keeled and seems to be fair for now... Im not very far into the game but upgrading isnt too difficult and the physics make it very exciting!', 'I understand that a free game need ads, this one starts ads every 1 or 2 races, but after playing for a while, adds start showing out of nowhere, long annoying adds interrupting your race. It became way too much. Time to uninstall.', 'Excellent game, excepting that the amount of advertising is extremely off-putting. Worth putting your hand in your pocket and paying a little towards the game and getting rid of them, however. Big fun. 😊', ""Not playing until you make level 2 easier. I've spent over an hour on this level and never even came close to finishing it, and I'm afraid if i play for any longer I'm probably gonna split everything in my house in half out of rage. DON'T WASTE YOUR LIFE ON THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"", ""The game is fun. But the ads kill the game. Rips the fun right out of the game. I'm tired of watching a video every race or every restart. Bye bye. Uninstall."", ""I just love Hot Wheels race off, because it's like so fun. Because of all the challenges that they have. Like different tracks I mean you have to have different cars to complete the course and then you move on to the next level. But it's it's just so fun you should try it for yourself you will find it awesome. Oh and by the way haha you will like it!!!!!!!!"", ""Great racing game all around EXCEPT for the fact that you guys made a token for each car instead of one token for each set after how long... So now u mean to tell me all the tokens I've been saving up on my maxed out car to help me upgrade the class of car in that set won't do stank for me on the next car"", ""Game is great! Too many ads. I was fine with ads between every try, but now ads pop up mid driving and ruin the try by playing the ad and returning you to game menu. Also make ads age-appropriate and make sure they won't force the player to leave the game. Also cars getting stuck inside the track, usually happens with high dives. Also there is a bug in the daily challenges, Off Duty, Winner but gives So close as result as if you lost instead of winning. Have to lose for real before you can win."", 'This game is super awesome and has many levels. Controls are is easy to use. But you could give new cars for the game because you are making more than 1000 different car toys so you could give a few cars to the game.', ""I have enjoyed playing this game but I've had to uninstall and reinstall it 2 time already due to it being stuck trying to load when I first open the game. I hope there is another update soon to fix this problem. Thanks"", ""Fun little game, good graphics and decent game play. The tracks are very very short though. You're forced to watch a 30 second ad/video after about every second or third race (sometimes two ads). Menu screen between races is very cluttered. You can't reuse most cars in future races as you're forced to continually upgrade your car. Coins collected with maxed out cars are useless and are not carried over...meaning that if you race with an older car you can't use the coins collected for anything. They charge $8 to buy one locked car!! I'd rather pay $3-$7 to outright buy a game and not spend half my time watching ads. Despite being a fun game (when you do get to play) there are a lot of negatives which greatly overpass any enjoyment you'd get from playing. Had it on the phone for a day and got rid of it. Too bad."", ""Downloaded game hoping to have lots of fun as I am a long time hot wheels lover. Ten minutes later, I try to open the game, and the game just crashes without even trying to run the game's script. Really disappointed."", ""He controls aren't that good but it has a lot of good gameplay and I think it's really good but if you don't like ads and you shouldn't get it."", ""Play with Ahmed is going for a yard here. I got it on my tablet so funny, it's me cuz I like to play it. I love the way every time I brought back a lot. Of course if you beat the level you win Unless you blow up. If you blow up you die."", 'Honestly I actually thought that it was boring, but then I played on my nephews tablet and I was like O.M.G.!!!!!!!So I have been playing for two and a half years of experiencing Hot wheels race off!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!', ""The best game in the world i've ever had this game is nice i love it and also i enjoyed offroad,Alternative,mucsle,creauture i love it so much its the one of the best game i rate 100 stars it so nice and its nice cause the graphics controls and gameplay also this game provides racing thank you unloading this and you may like my meassage."", 'Bge. BEST.GAME.EVER. I love this game so mush that I had got all the cars and had to delete it to play it again.The swamp level scares me because the spider on the booster I almost had a heart attack there.', ""Though this game is very fun to play, I give this game 2 stars, because apparently there was a 'conflict' with the game save. It made me lose a big chunk of my progress, because it got rid of the upgrades I put on some cars yesterday to unlock 4 of the top cars, 1 in each set. I had the cars yesterday, and now they're gone. The autosave system on this game is terrible, I do NOT recommend it unless you continually want to achieve the same goals, even though you've already done them."", 'Great graphics, simple and easy controls, cool gameplay. Only concern is glitches that happen when you play on Google Play compatible, touchscreen Chromebooks in laptop mode, and press the keys. Glitches: F: Fly R: Restart B: Blow you( and your opponent up) <: Jump back >: Jump Forwards. If Hutch fixes this, this should be the best racing game ever.', 'Its fun but takes a long time to upgrade cars. The think I hate is how theres only 40 or 50 cars amd when you get them theres nothing to do. There are millions of hotwheel cars but this is less than 1 percent of their full potential. Add highway 35 cars. Battle force 5 cars. Like this game needs so much more content that im willing to pay for dlc. Just no battle pass.', ""The breaks are not working properly and another's cars fuel will be always full why not for our car our car will always rotate 1side to another side but why not another car will rotate this game is worst you will jealous on our car this why always lose the game this is how your game is this is the worst one in playstore this is how you do cheating htdhf htd grd.

And also fix some bug on the track that stuck the tyre in it.', ""It is very bad game. No interest in this game so I give one star only. Please do not install this game this is very bad game. It has very bad pictures . Sometimes it takes time for play. It has so many ads come. Ok please do not install list this is your first you don't install your space also over please do not use download this game"", ""This game is very important for entertainment. It improves your brain for many things and tricks. If you're looking for a way to get yourself entertained, then this game is the correct choice."", 'ads, ads and more ads and that to just be able to play: greedy ad revenu app: not for me and I hope your app fails so that you change your ways....

The only thing that would give it 5 stars is the adds, theres to many adds. It would be great to have a new place to drive cause the others are getting boring so if you could fix the adds and create a new place then it will be cool.', ""Absolutely amazing. Unlike other games, this is definitely not pay-to-win or anything. All you need to do to unlock the best cars is drive fast/ collect in-game money from the rewards section (1 hour reward, daily bonus, drive 25km) to get easy money. And, if you're that type of person, you can watch ads for in-game money aswell. And even tho it takes quite a bit of saving to get the best purchasable car (as u can expect), it's worth it!

It is really fun but I just wish there was more space to drive my koenninsegg around like add a race track so I can drive and add more buildings and challenges and more places to go other than a airport and off road. Also add a multi- player mode if possible. It would be really cool if I could play with my siblings. Overall great game keep up the good work!! 😀', ""I love this game, my family was quite surprised when they saw me playing it though!😂 I believe that having a night option would be nice( I prefer playing when the 'night mode' comes on)....also if the police cars could chase us randomly, that would be great(if they could just randomly come 'alive', not every time we pass them but every now and then)....idk....maybe think about it? But overall I feel like this is a top notch game!😜"", ""Great fun! I understand all controls and it's cool to see how fast you can go.

Bike upgrades. I do not understand how someone with the same bike as me can jump 10x times more than me when my bike is fully upgraded. Maybe hack?! 3.

Edit 5/2/20: Thank you for your response but this is not an RPG. If a game like is that frustrating for players they have too seek support in order to get to the next level, it ceases to be fun. I don't mind a challenge but some of these levels are ridiculous. I will be deleting this game."", ""What a shame. I loved this game when it wasn't a constant money grab. The other 2 maps were available for free. Now you lock them!? £18 a month!? I'm annoyed because if it was a one time purchase of £18 then I might have done it but £18 is still a lot of money!

Gravity Rider Zero,com.vividgames.gravity.rider.zero.bike,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vividgames.gravity.rider.zero.bike&hl=en&gl=us,"Hot on the trails of Gravity Rider comes Gravity Rider Zero, a new streamlined moto racing experience. 

Here there are no upgrade parts, no difficulty spikes or races against overpowered vehicles: every track is perfectly balanced so you can always beat it right now, using your favorite ride.

🏍🏍 MAKE YOUR WAY OVER OBSTACLES 🏍🏍 
In this bike balancing game, you will be climbing over obstacles, discovering new clever mechanics and trials to overcome in each level. 
Giant ramps, lasers, spikes, or good old gravity will try to get in your way. No sweat though, your vehicle has the perfect speed to pass through - with a bit of finesse, you will be fine and not fall off.

🏍🏍 DOZENS OF HI-TECH PROTOTYPES TO RIDE 🏍🏍 
Collect dozens of unique racing vehicles with futuristic designs. Unlock new bikes by completing tasks, beating challenges or breaking track records: there’s always a new objective and a new reward to look forward to. From trials bikes to ATVs, WW2 era motorbikes to space rockets, they’re all in there.

🏍🏍 NO GRINDING 🏍🏍 
Here’s a list of what you won’t find in Gravity Rider Zero:
- No overpriced upgrade parts
- No grinding
- No tickets
- No timegates
- No difficulty spikes
- No artificial difficulty 
- No limited garage space. 


🏍🏍 WHAT YOU WANT, WHERE YOU WANT 🏍🏍 
You can unlock all the racing cars and bikes you want. You can dash on your moto, mmx buggy or quad whenever you want. You can speed with them on any track you want - their stats are always perfectly balanced for the race you’re in. Yep, no secret ultimate cheat bike, no special wheels of doom - here, all motorcycles are good.

🏍🏍 IT’S ALL YOU 🏍🏍 
The controls in Gravity Rider Zero are simple and precise. Accelerate and tilt your bike in the right places to pass over obstacles faster. Brake in time to avoid traps. Always tilt after a jump to touch the ground earlier and gain more traction. Brake before a jump to minimize your air time, try and try again. 
Or, just focus on making sure you pass obstacles, don’t crash and beat the level. Bike racing is a customizable experience: you decide how deep you want the mechanics to be.

🏍🏍 FULL CAREER MODE 🏍🏍 
Enjoy a classic solo career progression system: you get enough lives to clear 3 stages, and then move onto the next world. Each new world features a new gimmick, and you will see a planets’ load of environments. That’s not an image: you will literally travel from planet to planet to face the most crazy tracks in the universe. Oh and of course, your vehicle stats will increase along the way: it’s all balanced, but you <i>will</i> get faster.

🏍🏍 COLLECT AND CUSTOMIZE 🏍🏍 
Admire and customize your vehicle collection. Give your race car a new paint job, give your motorbike a different colour, or upgrade your kart with a neon lights trail. Even if your motorcycle is always perfectly tuned, that doesn’t mean you cannot upgrade your style!

🏍🏍 JUST CHILL 🏍🏍 
Gravity Rider Zero is all about two things: getting cool rides, and pure racing. That’s how we do things here, in the career mode. We focus on what matters, and to heck with the fluff. You want to optimize your turns, race against the clock, get the best time? You can.
You want to take your time getting through creative levels? You can too.

Just enjoy the ride and pop a wheelie. :)

And improve the visual graphics.', 'The game is great but if you cant use one side of your screen it is almost impossible i feel that you should be able to move the controls', ""Great game so far. I always read some reviews before playing. Noticed a lot mentioning how you have to start from the beginning once you've lost your life. Will admit this concerned me at first. However, after playing and experiencing this for myself I think it's a good feature to have. Made me more determined to win and also gave me the chance to beat my previous time."", 'It is very interesting and attractive. It is amazing. It is something that makes us feel better and it makes our focus better. It makes us more comfortable and our concentration good.', 'Thought this was going to be live racing against others. Seems to be single player. Live multiplayer would be awesome. I liked this. Having to start over at the very beginning is a little harsh.', ""Extremely frustrating and not an enjoyable game to play. You spend more time watching ads to continue or skip than you do actually playing the game. Uninstalled as it's just space that could be used for something better."", ""Good game, levels are annoying that you have to restart from the very begining and not the last event, besides that it's quite fun but needs more levels and some sort of progression."", ""It's a really great game honestly! It's fun it's challenging and great graphics. Controls are great"", 'I really like th art style, love the game but I think an upgrade system to make you bike flip faster, have faster acceleration and top speed would be cool.', 'Very good game it has great graphics and the game is simple to play but still gives you a great game experience.', 'Good game but the ads are so frustrating', 'I love this game simple but lots of fun and cool bikes to choose from not a lot of ads a game you could really get lost in', 'Nice game but please make it offline please. It is very good for racing and look very much nice.', 'Great game, with nice graphics but there is a place for improvement for it..', 'It is very good game to play. As it has only 33 levels and i have completed all the levels', 'Very good and addictive. Specially the bikes are ❤', 'Too many adverts!!! I had to watch an agonising 13 adverts just to get to level 6!! What an awful game!! Deleted it 1 hour after getting it', 'Great graphics and physics, I liked opening a bunch of vehicles for vid watching.', 'Very nice game but you should give to control left and right', ""It's a really good game the graphics are amazing and it's a really catchy game"", ""Wow it's amazing game I really like it too much but please give more chance in stages"", 'I have really enjoyed this game. It has lots of fun with bikes.', 'Simple and easy game with good graphics', 'A good game when you are bored and graphic are very good', ""It's the best game ever the graffitis are the amazing."", 'Great game. Just a really wonky camera', ""This game isn't starting... Showing error... Hate it..."", 'This game is such a life changer for me.It is the first game that I love.It is a creative game', ""Everything's good except the fact that once you die you have to restart the whole level. Atleast let us start at the same course or give us three lives for the whole thing... Always game to watch the stupid long ads to get revived. Also, there is no reason to make the game completely online, its just a race with computer. If possible also add more game modes like an endless mode with unlimited lives and stuff..."", 'Good game but has some problems.', 'Starting to get annoyed on level 7😡 its so hard ive bine trying for 30 mins might delete later i would play if game was easer', 'Five Stars it is. first i liked Gravity but the Gravity Zero is on the NEXT LEVEL!! BTW you can get vehicles for Watching Ads and its AMAZING!! And can you add more vehicles cause there are a very low amount of vehicles', ""Great game ! There are a few things that doesn't make this a 5 star rating : 1. a previous user mentioned a sound clip in game that needs revising and I agree. As the bike picks up speed, a sound like tires rolling on gravel at low speed can be heard. It could be removed with no ill effect. 2. Control buttons needs to be bigger (some of us have big fingers) and a little distanced between each other (or better yet, custom size and placement via Settings). Thank you."", 'Its pretty fun to play and you can Race another computer which is fun Wow', ""It's pretty much Gravity Rider 1.1, repainted here and there (not even redesigned). Same tracks, same bikes. The only difference is many new pay-or-watch mechanisms, like lives: if you crash, you loose a life and your current stage progress is reset. You run out of lives immediately, of course, but hey, you can buy some more :-) Oh, and chests no longer contain anyhing useful. The first game was very successful, so do understand the temptation to release it twice.""]"

I remember when the gas and brake pedals were just there for that purpose and you had to use your devices built in gyroscope. Now with the Tilt.

Progress can be a little slow at first, but it speeds up after you get good at tracks and cars you enjoy driving. The one thing I absolutely hate is the custom car garage. In theory it sounds awesome, but slowly unlocking upgrade cards from chests, spending tons to upgrade, and then the cars aren't as good as basic cars"", ""I'm rating this game one star because I had this game for 4 years had my original email linked and it didn't sync any of my data from play games.

I love how the updates give you permanent cars you can earn and keep! I was really sad years ago that I couldn't get this game on my phone or tablet! ABSOULUTELY LOVE THIS GAME!!!!!"", 'The graphics and music are excellent. The part of game that I do not like is when the vehicle has to pass through an underground passage which seems more like a sewer. The use of words “Asphalt"" and “infected” are not appropriate for racing games. Also, the third level of upgradation of vehicles costs 4 to 5 times the cost of second level of upgradation does not make any sense.', ""This game is pretty good, but it really sucks right now. The cars are wicked expensive and the developers dont understand that not everyone is willing to use real money to buy game currency to get cars. This can be really bad when you want to get high ranks in multiplayer seasons because of you dont have very good cars, you're out of luck. This game NEEDS to make their cars cheaper."", ""I played this on my surface pro back in 2015/16. It was great. I decided to install it again on my phone 4/5 years later. I still love the game, but I HATE how you can't upgrade with those cards unless you pay for some stupid premium currency that the only way to get it is through microtransactions! It used to be a pretty cool part of the game. Besides that, the graphics are amazing, gameplay is pretty fun, and I would overall reccomend the game. Too bad I can't use those cards, though."", ""Really interesting. There may be ads here and there, but a thrill ride! I am going to say a little improvement you could do. I know it's not a good idea, but if you join you should get free 1,000 coins and 50 tokens. But apart from that, really great! Keep it up asphalt!"", ""The game is getting worse and worse every new update. Harder for new players to build a good career unless they are rich. The ppl running the game are just money hungry, they try to suck the money out of your pocket in every possible way. For new players: don't play it unless you are rich or you are not willing to spend real money on such a dying game. Quite sad honestly, and as a veteran player I advice you not to play the game. Farewell Asphalt 8 :'/ and thanks vivendi for ruining the game."", 'Graphics, sounds & control are awesome. It\'s quite addictive, but when I play multiplayer races, man this game sucks, everytime i enter the race pannel, instead of connecting me to the race, it shows me that ""can\'t connect to the server"" even when my internet connection is quite fast, this problem has brought me down to ranking of 1700 from 2000, oh man! That hurts. I request Gameloft to please solve this issue, cuz it sucks. Otherwise for offline use, this might be the best racing game in store', 'A fun Free to Play game from 2013 that features gravity and physics defying stunts with beautiful licenced vehicles from around the world. The graphics are stunning and the racing is action packed and gratifying while complimented a great soundtrack. The down side is the complicated and grindy in game money system that features option to use real money. I recommend to play this game casually without trying to be hard core. Just have fun while the fun lasts then move on.', 'Just keeps getting better. I\'ve been entertained by this app for at least 3yrs, and on different types of devices including my laptop starting from the first season each time. Just to play again. stay on it, there is no competition in this category. You scored fat. All who participated in this creation deserves a healthy, healthy bonus. 50 stares just like our flag.

Whenever I am playing a round, and I demolish all the other cars and get in the lead, it puts me back in 6th place and it is really frustrating. Please fix this minor problem. Thank you! (I do reccomend though.)', 'The most foolish game so far, if the developers wants money then they should try and stop the foolish things they do in the multiplayer mode, when you win a race they rate you with only one point but if you lose they will down rate you with 10 points, and at thesame time plenty cheats in that mode...foolishness,,i will tell all my friends to uninstall it, its a cheat', 'It\'s a great game, don\'t get me wrong, but I have two complaints: I\'d rather pay up front for a game than have it be pay-to-win. Furthermore, it forces me to update before letting me past the loading screen (even without an internet connection or if the update isn\'t available) and I\'d like some update notes every update (even if it\'s just ""fixed bugs""). The last update had no update notes, no content added, but still required the 1.3 GB download. You can do better. For example, only differences.', ""Fun game, but very credit hungry. It's exciting and has some variety. The controls are good. The graphics settings can be adjusted for better performance. The main issue is the monetery system. It seems like a very credit hungry game. You earn credits for making accomplishments, and you can buy them with real money. Even though you get rewarded very often, you run out of credits fast to keep up with the upgrades needed."", 'Only a few games become legendary in the eyes of the gamers. This is one of them. It has everything, from high class cars to endless customisation and a lot of fantabulous tracks. Plus it has bikes that hardly any other game contains. The experience has always been flawless.

It would be awesome...................', ""It's a fantastic game, but have so many ads, ads everywhere! Some cars are very expensive, that doesn't make sense.

Thanks!"", ""I love this game and haven't missed a day playing in over 2 years! BUT, you have to drop the Fusion coins now! You have made it extremely difficult to fully upgrade vehicles now. My first thought is to stop getting new cars that I won't be able to upgrade. The fusion coins are difficult to accumulate and takes over a million per car!!? This alone is making me lose interest in the game, please rethink this....."", ""Great but with a negative. I love this game! Exquisite scenery, lots of game modes, great cars. It's everything I could ask for in my ideal car game! However, there is one greatly annoying thing in the game. When I upgrade my car, I can only upgrade it to a point before I need to buy fusion coins with real money. This greatly frustrates because before it used to just be normal coins. Now I have a massive load of cards that I will never be able to use. Please change it back to normal coins."", 'The game is a great racing game and it is really fun and stands the test of time. The only problem is that i would play it off line becuase one of the new updates created a lot of adds.

This is a real good game.', ""Bottom line: another extortionate cash grab by EA. Do the math, this games costs $15,000 to completely unlock. This is such a disgusting cash grab, that it even caps the credits you can earn daily without paying money. The sad part, the racing mechanics are good . From an honest publisher, I would have happily paid $15. Even then, they leave out basic settings like choosing automatic or manual transmission or remapping buttons. Play GRID Autosport instead. Don't give these jerks your money."", ""RR3 has changed the game. I have NEVER played a game that has been this intense! I feel as if I could now step out on the tracks and do this FOR REAL!

Just wow. After playing this I wonder if the person who coded the ai has ever played a racing game before. The ai constantly stops mid corner right on the apex and just brake checks you all the time. 90 percent of the time when you lose a race its becaue the horrendous ai is literally blocking you half the time not becaue they are faster than you. If I was a developer I would be ashamed to release a game with this quality of ai.', 'I\'m editing my review from 5 to 4 stars. This game remains excellent, but since a few updates ago, the soundtrack has changed. I find it too ""severe"", rather than before it was jammin. Also, ""win this car for FREE"" is misleading. You have to spend your R$ and Gold to upgrade the car to meet the PR as the race progresses. Unless you have unlimited real money, this game is a ""paycheck to paycheck"" deal where you spend your accumulated game money faster than it comes in. Will keep playing.', 'Wonderful game but your upgrades for the cars are to dam expensive. I can buy a playstation car game for only $65 and have all the fun upgrading cars of my choice without paying anything additional. The upgrades are a joke. No better rims, body kits, better decals etc. Costs for the upgrades are outrageous and ridiculous!!!!! My ratings still remain the same. Wonderful game but upgrades/gold is too dam expensive', ""Real racing has qualifying laps, so you shouldn't have to start last every race. Real life has multi car purchases. The brake does not activate reverse and put on the throttle. The other racers and their cars don't get better because you progressed farther. The other racers' similar cars can't enter a race your fully fixed up car can't enter. Cars can take a turn without applying the brake. This isn't common core math where stupid rules define whether you get it credit or not."", ""The racing is great, the cars are great. But it's one big IN APP PURCHASE after another. Paywall after paywall!!!! They keep enticing you to upgrade your car or enter new limited competitions, only to hold a carrot over your head to buy more gold, more gold, more gold App purchases. And you can't compete if you don't!! Sad..."", ""I''m disappointed that in the raceday LeMans the required PR jumped 2.4 points to race which equalled about 275 coins and presumably would have jumped again to finish the challenge. still enjoy the game. The slow to load the races issue has been rectified. The game is now the best it has been in the time I've been playing. With the latest upgrade some of the advertisements are approaching 45 seconds in length."", ""Although F1 racing is exciting and heart pounding. The Constant Opponent Extra Agressive Pit Manuvers which makes it more like a recking derby is discouraging to play. Update: Along with the intentional pit manuvers, it is clear the only way to win in the Daily Races(which you need to do to acquire MS), is to cheat by cutting corners, do an occasional pit manuver your self, and don't need to upgrade because the competition's level will always stay ahead of your vehicle."", ""A really great game exept with the new update I have lost 2 cars out of my collection and it's like even the money I spent on the cars is gone. Very big issue and I may not play for a while because this makes me mad. I am missing the Ariel atom v8 and the pagani huayra and some progression in the game. If nothing fixes I will delete the game because I'm not wasting my time on getting cars and doing events if they will just dissapear after an update."", ""Great game graphics just you have to spend to much money to go anywhere thet should make it easyer to earn money for the game the addition of f1 as a series great but I would rather just spend 40 bucks on the game and be able to modify my cars buy poi ts acrude by wins and achievements instead of being stuck because I refuse to pay 40 bucks a month just to keep up with others this is a money makeing machine and that's just not fare for the people that have been playing this game for years it to"", ""It's very realistic, like it says.

Good obtainable goals and makes you better and wanting more.', ""great, but you still charge way too much for upgrades on cars, I'm sure you are millionaires by now, it's only fair that you reduce the prices way way down. Another thing when I first started playing this game, you give away free cars, the Hennessy venom was one of them, you stopped doing that also, with all due respect, for you this game is all about money, not the fun of the game, not expecting a reply, I know I won't get one.

I wish i could give you more than 5 stars....', ""For a mobile game it's pretty good. When I first started playing I had a budget phone and wasn't impressed with the gameplay, but I've upgraded my phone to a OnePlus 7Pro and love this game now. It has decent sensitivity, great graphics, endless cars, just wish you could do practice laps on tracks to get to learn your markers. One big disappointment is the price they charge to buy cars you want($30-$99 USD) that is just EA's greed coming out again.Great game just don't spend your money on it!!!"", ""It's good but every time I try the first F1 race it didn't work but really tons of races and cars."", 'Lately the game has not been saving to the cloud keeps telling me it failed.

I am playing on my Pixel 3 XL, but larger screen size of the tablet is very beneficial when driving race cars."", ""The actual racing is great, even on a small phone. The experience of finding a race is clunky. A player's ability to compete in a championship without spending significant cash is limited. Even a fully upgraded car is sometimes unable to enter a race for lack of upgrades."", ""I enjoy this game but the cost for gold Coins is ridiculous. The cost for some individual upgrades can cost $10 $15 for 1 upgrade in gold Coins depending on what series your in. It gets expensive to play and I'd enjoy it more if I didn't have to constantly refilling my gold coins cause the packs are always skimpy. Some cars cost $50-$100. Come on now that's ridiculous. I'd rather play my xbox one if that's the case. CONTENT IS TOO EXPENSIVE!!! dont you guys make enough money off this game?"", ""Fun to play. Very frustrating though when you can't win the last race in a section because they make it too difficult. Endurance is the worst. You trying to get 8 miles. You play it again because you're a little short and they change it to 12 miles. They are also very stingy with the gold. They don't like to give it to you but they make you buy most everything with it."", ""Of all the features and cars included in the game, the lack of a track testing mode really kills it for me. Like, WHY ISN'T IT THERE??? Makes no sense for a game with such physics. On top of that, car upgrades are way too heavily dependant on months of grinding OR mini transactions. Classic EA for ya 🙄"", ""I tried to put in a suggestion to Electronic Arts about Real Racing, but could not find a way to do it. So I'm going to have to put it out here. During drag racing The tachometer needle should be black. So you can see it better. Maybe people who are supposed to win will win then. All I'm asking for is a little more contrast.

The difficulty level of this game is way too high. I've been playing this game for several months now, and I'm only on tier 3! It takes an extremely long time to gather money from races. Not to mention I upgraded my T3 car 2-3 times now, and the difficulty of the races has not decreased at all, forcing me to race regulation races more. CSR 2 is way easier! Shifting also seems to be way more difficult than it should be!"", ""I love this game! I've been playing for a long time now off and on, and it's one I keep coming back to. However, this last time I downloaded it, it's been acting glitchy (weird word coloring and such), and it syncs to my google play account but I lost EVERYTHING. It stinks, because I had some serious time put into it, but I'll just get to do it over now. Only reason is not 5 stars is because I lost everything and I'm still in the salty stage. Keep going developers! We need more games like this!"", ""This game is wonderful, but it needs a sequel, you dont find games completely dedicated to hot rods, and that's what makes this game so revolutionary and unique, adding multiplayer or a sequel would make a great game in my opinion."", 'My favorite game BUT when i came back to it on a new device after about 2 years? Maybe little more I had lost all my progress would be 5 stars but little salty :/ that aside though great game just make sure you know that chances are when you change devices you will lose your save data.', ""Money grab trap! Don't get wrong, I love the cars, perfect except they make you guess the yr model? But as soon as you spend a lot of time & some real money to build the car to a stage 4 & 5 so you can win, they raise you up a tier in levels & now the time & money you spent on your car is useless because now you can't use it for the next level racing. You now need to purchase gold for a new car very expensive So money grab, for CSR. Would be a lot of fun. 3 stars for making realistic cars."", ""It's a fun game. But needs some improvement. Like most of the good, cool, old muscle cars you have to buy with gold. And unless you pay in with real money it takes forever to get enough to buy one. And parts are no where near realistic prices. And some of the daily battle races are a joke. Your racing the same car as the computer and if you don't get a perfect run from start to finish you never win. That's not how real life racing works. Maybe Its just me expecting to much from a game."", 'Was the 1st mobile game that I REALLY got into. Updates brought in new cars, ended up spending some actual $$. They stopped updating it & after completing everything w/ no new cars it became stale. I would clear/restart (with all the gold/units given back) and build up a different car until I had built every one. Then I got a new phone, couldnt even log in.

However, it keeps promting you to buy cars with real money, and even tank upgrades, and when it offers cars with tokens, and you've been saving up tokens, it's normally within 10 tokens.

I felt like I was actually having a lot of fun on android game. Sadly after some progress the game doesn't allow me to go forward because my cars arent fast enough and guess how I can make them faster? Yep you guessed it! Spend $$$ on gold to buy parts. Just another one of the bunch I guess. If you want to add in-game purchases thats fine. But don't stop me from progressing or enjoying the game. If you play against other players to get parts they're ll gods"", 'Love the game. Wonderful, just wanna make continual updates to my review. The last big update annoyed me a little because one of the car blueprint leveles was changed but whatever, time moves on. The lunar new year update was great and I loved the map looks, but now... the music. Jesus. I hear the same three songs on repeat all the time. I dont hate the music but, come on, variety PLEASE! Still a great game though.', ""Useless, rigged so you can advance only if you pay, can't win an event even if you win all the time because they don't give enough races to you ,only one every 48 minutes, and you have to race again to get the PR up, and so on, and on campaing you'd have to watch so many advertisements that you'd become sick, i just got sick of it and I'll uninstall, i suggest you don't do like i did to invest time in it, and especially don't invest money as you'd only be asked for more, as it is NO LIMITS yes?"", 'This game is impossible to get very far without spending hard earned cash on gold. Initially they lull you into believing that this game actually might not be pay 2 win and can be enjoyed without spending money, but once they\'ve hooked you on the game it hits you HARD. They\'ll give you a few cars for free, or earned very easily, towards the beginning and you\'ll cruise through the first chapters of the campaign. Eventually it gets to the point where that car just doesn\'t cut it anymore and you\'ll need a new one, but good luck farming a better car because you can\'t even grind in this game without paying money. It\'s locked behind time gates that can be skipped by paying premium currency, and even if you\'re fine with that have fun trying to get the part you want. Most of the time when you replay a mission looking for a part you\'ll only get ingame cash which isn\'t very useful, besides at the very early stages. They do this same thing in ""events"" which initially are quite fun and again they lull you in thinking you won\'t need to spend money to complete the event because the first 3-4 days can be farmed. After that you CANNOT play the game enough because of all the missions you can only replace a couple times per day, which on top of the event also being timed makes it impossible to get all the parts required to upgrade the car in order to unlock the next stages. So you\'re forced to make a decision: Pay money to progress to the next stages so you can keep the car you\'ve been working to get the past week, or don\'t pay and lose all the progress you just made and through all the time you spent doing it down the drain. I\'d suggest the latter and just uninstal the game, or never play it in the first place.', 'You guys as game developers, should work on a faster start up page. For example, sometimes I only have about 5 mins to play, so when I login in it takes 5 mins to even start the game. Please work on that and as well as the clarity of cars, some cars have really bad detail and resolution!! Otherwise good job!!', 'Great game overall. Too bad it takes ages to upgrade a car. You are so limited because of the numbers of plays and also the events sucks. You get a full car only if u complete it and there is no possible way to get to the last day and finish the event without spending a lot of your gold currency. I understand the need of money...but maybe u can offer more balance for other players as well...maybe some of us cannot get the best experience out of the game because of your money hunger .', ""The game graphics are amazing and the controls 🎮 are not bad either... The only thing about this game... It's only for the rich💰... You may think of grinding but there's a fuel ⛽ system that makes it impossible to advance in the game. You can play close to an hour ⏳or less. The game play isn't ideal with hard to get blue prints. Meaning you will hit a wall pretty fast. The game isn't bad, but like I said... This game is for rich. If you have money 💵 throw around then you will enjoy the game."", ""Good graphics and gameplay do not make up for the fact this game is barely playable with the long load times, even longer wait times, and not to mention that energy bar you call a gas tank. I used to love these Need for Speed games, but, since all you soulless, money hungry developers seem INTENT on running the entire franchise into the ground, I can't take it anymore. I hope you had fun ruining everything for me personally, but I'm DONE with Need for Speed. Entirely. TO HELL WITH EA."", 'This game is good in graphic. But to many problem.. It takes to much time to login n you will need to download 441 mb for resource and its not offline.. And you can play 10 matches only and you need to wait for the nxt few hours to play.. Biggest problem it tekes way to much time to login of your connection is not so good.. Its better to ply fortnight or pubg.. Instead of trying to login.. This stupid game.. My biggest mistake waiting for 20 kin for this game to login.', ""Now I'm playing this game on my galaxy s10 and it's amazing. The graphics, stability and gameplay experience is awesome. I've played it for over a year now and still love it, especially when I have a tuned car. But the only thing I dont like is that you can't race friends online. 1 on 1 racing with people you know would be awesome. Food for thought EA!"", 'Its so hard to upgrade & rebuild parts if you don\'t plan to purchase gold. What\'s more frustrating is you can\'t tap the desired option at the mystery prize segment. So I can\'t proceed with challenges. So I bought some gold and faithfully stayed the course to try and get a fast car in the ""undercover challenge"" but its wishful thinking to do it if. The time period is just too short. Regrettably, I am going to uninstall the game so that I do not lose my sanity. Really disappointed.', ""Very good game, although since the last update i am losing many of the races because at a point when i am in the race and drifting, the car crashes in the wall and can't take it out until I shake my phone a little bit....and also, it would be better if the parts were cheaper...so you don't have to race 1000times the same race to get the part that you need or to make money to buy them...at some point it gets boring"", '2stars due to the name of this need for speed was unlimited. But was highly disappointed to know there are limits on the races you can join, limits on the qualification power for each race, limits on how many races you can repeat, limits on the mod parts you can buy daily. Basically there limits on everything you do. So exactly what is the unlimited part for?', ""This game have been frustrating me for the past few days. For me to access other events, I was told to download the full game (which by the way cost a little over 700mb, add that to the 1.6gb used to download the game) and twice I was told to update the game (also cost 400mb each) which I've done. All in all, the game cost me a little short of 3gb. And this morning I woke up and I can't even access the game, the screen shows that I've to download the full game. THIS GAME SUCKS!!!"", 'I like the game it had a good story the game keeps the player hooked but when doing the events i think like theres not enough time to complete the events and the the amount of tickets the player has are very important in playing the events and the amount of time need to wait for the tickets is too long I recommend you make the events worth the time to play and instead of it being not possible to win.', 'Curious, when you complete a weekly campaign and all the funding that is used is considered ""Loan"". Why is it not giving me back my loaned gold bars? When you go to the Lunar store and use gold and it says ""Loan"" next to the amount of bars required for purchase. Yet, at the completion of the series. E.g. UnderCover. I am not returned my gold bars. Can you advise please. Like and share this post if you have noticed it and want feedback.

Just have fun and alot of patience. EA, y'all doing a great job out here. Started playing FIFA recently too. WELL DONE GUYS. CANT GET ENOUGH. ITS A MUST DOWNLOAD."", ""A beautiful game with amazing graphics but all of that is ruined by the pay-to-win mechanics. Once you get past the introductory part of the game where game play and advancement is easy and free, you're faced with the choice between grinding through race after race to try to earn parts, or paying cash. And not small cash either - I estimate it would cost $30-50 to fully upgrade a single car, and there are dozens of cars in the game. Uninstalling!"", ""Takes waaaayyyyyyy too long to get upgrades that are worth while for cars without spending money. Im on chapter 8, took a month to get a car upgraded enough to make it to the boss. Now who knows how long it'll take to upgrade to actually race the boss. Maybe a year? If it takes much longer Im just gonna uninstall."", 'The game is not bad but it needs work ""alot"" of it, controls are useless and it seems the game can\'t be simple it\'s always pestering you to do drifts, life\'s not all about drifts! Another flaw is always unlock this, and unlock that! the need for speed I knew and grew up with from under ground was simple, this game however expects alot of effort for nice cars and something not worth it, I don\'t recommend this to anyone, I thought I\'d like it, but after 2 days, lost interest...', ""Everything is just awesome. But we just only have a one problem. i.e : while playing in tilt mode after the reputation level increases to 25, i have a serious issue of the tilt control setting, i have been playing this game in tilt mode since i started to play. But today while playing the steering just turned towards to the full left without my gesture. I doesn't only happens to me but also similarly to my friend. Please take it into concern. Thisis such a wonderful game,so don't lose ur worth"", ""This would've gotten 5 starts. It got 4, because of the length of the races. The races are too short even when you're competing against others. That's my only problem. Apart from that, it's a great game, it runs smooth, the music is great and the graphics and cars arenon point."", ""Got to PAY to make the top tiers in this game. Should be branded as pay to play. I've been trying to complete a challenge for weeks now, my car is more than up to the task however it's dark, hard to see and oncoming traffic makes it IMPOSSIBLE to get any further. I play games for fun and competition, this is NEITHER and so is getting UNINSTALLED! I do NOT Recommend this game to anyone who does not want to put money into it because past a certain point you can't go on without paying!"", ""It's a great game but it's not good that each 3-4 weeks to have an update, that we already did it from Google play, and to enter the game and have an additional of 1 GB to download it!! And if we have an internet corruption, we should go back to download from 0!!! Isn't proper at all. After multi try to download and after, finally, that 1 GB downloaded, still have to download an additional 17 mb, which I send you mails with screenshots and you didn't respond to any, that they can't be download"", ""Great game but you don't get a realistic chance of getting the loaner vehicle because of the time frame. The event is over 5-6 days and the first day takes up 2 days and each day after is one day of trying to gather enough materials to rank up high enough for the next race. Overall great game great graphics."", ""This game looks absolutely stunning. The wet surfaces make everything reflective and the textures look incredible, the detail is great and the cut scenes don't look like trash. But the gameplay experience is just garbage. Only control over the car is the steering, which is clearly very assisted. There's no accelerate or brake. No support for gamepads. The UI looks like a generic zombie ftp trash game. And the micro transactions are extremely annoying. Just make this again, but not crappy."", ""Overall decent game, but I wish dev's would revise the underground rival pairing logic. There's no reason I should be in the 3rd tier (c) with 440pr and racing people with over 600pr. Maybe in tier A but even that should be matched with people in your class. Be prepared to never move beyond tier D or C in these worthless races, no matter how many shots you give it. Who knows, maybe if you max the cars out you'll have a shot, but otherwise, dont expect much out of those races."", ""Revised: Everything is working well on it, quite pleased that you can spend little money and take a break from spending any for a few months with still a lot to do. Game has a lot to offer for free unlike many other mobile games in it's class. I'd be interested in seeing an additional mode for quickplay multiple car racing. As an easy means to do dailies and remove repetitiveness."", ""It's a really good game and can become a real Need for speed game. On the go what we all want is freeroam our phones are clearly capable of running freeroam our phones are faster than the PSP that can run racing games have a a big freeroam map like Midnight Club 3 that can easily be run in the psp with no issues even though the graphics are lower with a lower resolution. But phones can do alot now this game has been the same for years something big needs to happen to this game."", ""NFS still the best car racing game on earth!! The game perfectly enjoyable like the old PC version.. here's my review that EA should do next: 1. Add dashboard view mode 2. Make more laps race (1-3) 3. Subscription privilege (like pubg, and others..) 4. Multiplayer PvP ranked team & solo mode (underground still far matched the cars rating) 5. You figure out.."", 'Overall good game, but recent updates were a disaster. Persisting connection issues in PvP mode when connected to WiFi (can only play one race at a time). Mandatory advertisements then taking forever to reconnect. It seems like every update introduces another problem that remains unsolved. I know have to force stop the app and clear the cache just to be able to log in', ""It's done well and plays well!!. My complaint is with the time it takes to progress through the game (without buying gold). Numerous times I've started a race for a chance to get blueprints but once it's over the blueprint isnt even an option like it's supposed to be!!! Wouldn't recommend if you don't want to spend (a lot) of actual real money (parts get stupid expensive pretty quick)"", ""Really good but the only thing I would change is maybe your energy/fuel cap went up every 2nd level.This game is easy to get the hang of but grinding for gear at a low level for a high star car is hard (kinda obvious though). I had a complete starred car (I don't know as I started new) but I had low prestige (the stars were 5 or above) and because it was a pretty advanced car but my prestige was trash it took me forever to finally be able to start accessing the gear I needed to keep upgrading."", ""been playing this game for more than a year and its really awesome. love the layout and graphics but for the bit of special events its very disappointing. don't see why it takes almost 8 parts to get 1 single PR boost, surely it can be brought down to atleast 2 parts for a PR boost, give some chance of winning some of the nice cars, for us that don't do in-app purchase. other than that awesome game."", ""Updated review, the EA company doesn't care as usual about how the consumer feels. Oneplus 6T still has problems after OS 10 update and there no fixing of bugs, the special event races gets difficult even when you devote more than the usual time, and even gold rewards, one don't still get the reward of a loaned car. The final PR is always too high with the time frame and amount game played."", ""Way to many different menus. Gold bars, cash, fuel, car upgrades, car blueprints parts for the cars. The list goes on much longer. I just want to race but then I have upgrade the car for no reason besides the game forcing you to upgrade. It's a pain. Also the races are on the short side. I spent more time getting parts then actual racing. The races are all point to point races and they are short. The game does look good."", ""It's developers really shined in Real Racing 3, and this game is a far cry from that game in any way. The controls feel clunky, not even coming close to the similarly freemium Asphalt games. On top of that, the first thing the game throws at you is a lootbox before you can even race your first race, and after the first chapter it doesn't seem to get any better. For your own sake, just play Real Racing 3, Asphalt 8 (or 9), or if you can, Most Wanted for mobile. There are better ways to waste time"", 'It\'s an enjoyable game, but it has it\'s problems. First, it\'s ""pay to win"", because to get parts or blueprints you either have to win them, pay ""cash"" or pay gold. Most of the stuff costs gold and without paying REAL money for gold, it takes a long time to save up so you can get what you need to upgrade your cars. Second, it\'s repetitive as all get out. The tracks are the same thing over and over again. Finally, it\'s HUGE, as in 2 GBs of space huge. Ouch', ""would happily give this game a 5 stars but I have a couple problems, the steering will sometimes just randomly go and make you crash into a wall and also, can you put a yes or no menu when refilling fuel with gold, I have been saving for event tickets which also shouldn't take as long to do and I've spent my gold accidentally, I would like a refund but I know that's unlikely buy a menu would suffice"", ""The game is absolutely addictive BUT it's disappointing when it comes to the Rival Racing Campagain, the screening does NOT pick the right opponent with the same PR, or at least same wave. Makes it useless to know how good you are if your opponent is waaay over than you. I suggest, allow players to compete with the same PR wave, see who really have what it takes.""]"

ADVANCED POINTS SYSTEM
Points grow proportionally to drift angle, drift time and speed.
There are also 2 different points multiplier: ""Drift Combo"" multiplier and ""Proximity"" multiplier.
Drift Combo multiplier is increased by 1 whenever points reach a power of 2000 (1000, 2000,4000, 8000 etc.). If you change drift direction, points are added to Total Points Indicator (located in the top left of the screen) and reset. If points reach every multiple of 2000 again, Drift Combo is increased by 1 again. This works only if you keep drifting without too long interruptions between one drift and the other (less than 1 second), otherwise Drift Combo multiplier will be reset to 1.
Proximity multiplier is increased when you drift with the back of the car near a wall (less than 1.5 meters) proportionally to closeness. You'll notice this bonus with a slow motion effect and a text showing the multiplier factor.
If you hit anything you'll lose your partial points and all multipliers.

But most of these people are complaining because they have the disc version and its much better, No s**t it's a mobile game for gods sake , it's meant for console for a reason ! Free roam would be almost impossible, too much memory , battery , etc. Please stick with console game ."", ""It's completely different than the console version. The controls are a little weird, and generic controllers are NOT supported. I was looking for a traditional driving game, and I was disapointed, but that doesn't make it a bad game. The gas is automatically floored for you, and you control the steering and braking (mostly steering). Vehicle dynamics are a joke. Most corners are taken at top speed. Again, I'm not bashing; I'm just noting how different it is. It's still fun."", ""Something has changed. Picked this game up again after a year or two and they have done something to the game. I can't get past the #2 guy. I have raced my way with mods to $0 several times I can't even pass the guy once. I have the best car in class that is unlocked at my level and even if I drive perfectly with no mistakes I can't over take him for a second. It feels like a spend money or buy our newer game scheme."", ""This game lacks realism,how does a Ford escape police vehicle able to keep up with and destroy my current car, a Audi R8,that's not possible. Please add daily rewards and the realism of running away from the cops and the cops attacking other vehicles besides the player.The only positive is the sound track. This game is based in a fantasy land. The company that makes this game can do so much better.I can't believe I was stupid enough to pay money for this app."", ""It's not a console NFS it's mobile and being about 1gb graphics and races are dope. No real mods/customization options except paint. Controls are very basic but all these issues keep the memory footprint as small as possible. Police tactics (pit manuevers, roadblocks, etc) are aggressive (way more than NFS: No Limits) but keep the game challenging and interesting. Just wish it was updated more. Wasn't really feeling Asphalt 8 imo NFS: Most Wanted is a must have"", 'Awesome Game, But My game Crashed w /in the passed month or 2 ago.

I was extremely disappointed. They shouldn't even try to call it most wanted. It's completely different than the OG title. It's more closely related to all they free asphalt games. Don't buy."", ""The game is amazing and all and it's a great app to kill time. But it lacks the concept of being able to drive around the city and free roam like the console version and I would've given the game 5 stars but it lacks the free roam. But other than that, this is an awesome and great game!"", ""After doing a manufacturer's reset to my phone, only gets to checking license then app closes.

""No Limits"" I am not satisfied with, and it\'s way too slow!!!', ""In the higher levels it's really annoying how the only way for you to get gold is if you get lucky and the CPU hits a spike strip or gets hit by a cop car. It's not difficult at that point it's just rigged. Also, it really takes away from the experience of grinding to buy faster cars when you know that the CPUs will be unreasonably faster even when it's the same model you're using. The mods are worthless too because they'll just boost the top speed of the CPUs to match your speed."", ""Its a fun game but 5 dollars for a racing game!? I thought it was going to be like the one from Xbox. Just saying. It's still a good game and I like it. But not so much for a complete 5 stars. Maybe 4 and a half but that's just my opinion."", 'Controls are laking, some button directional buttons would be great, almost no car modifications besides paint and ""perks"" leaving a very empty NFS experince.

Drifting is the perfect weapon. Me too I thought it was GameCube(nes). Another great mistake was born./[ The ""Maserati"" must be the the fastest car in the world if you need a half a mile head start in front of it. At least silver in 2nd place is the best I can do. Blows away the competition. ] Hah!? Finaly came in first.', 'Looks great, controls are terrible. You have 3 control options, take it or leave it. You have tilt control (no). You have a weird analog steering wheel thing that appears where you touch, instead of a set location (ew). And you have controller; not any controller, no, a MOGA controller. The HECK is a Moga controller? Why specifically THAT controller? Does anyone actually own one of those? Why not have an on-screen button option like most other racing games? Cannot recommend, unless you like tilt', 'The game is amazing i like u added new vehicles that werent in the original from the xbox, also the graphics are stunning, the controls took a while to get use to. Overall the game is just great i recomend it.👍👍👍👍👍', ""I loved this game, but now when I boot it up it closes. It seems to not accept my license/purchase. It's very frustrating, because I had saved files. Until fixed, this will be 1 star"", 'The best racer for Android mobile, compared to the contenders real racing and asphalt. Sleek controls, good graphics and smart AI. Tested on Galaxy Tab.', 'The game is great, but it lacks cloud saves. I recently got a new phone and reinstalled the game but I lost all my progress because there is no way to save to the cloud or to save at all.', ""Don't listen to the 1* reviews. This game is great. Graphics and controls are both solid. The only reason someone wouldn't have a good time with this game is they either have a bad phone because this game does eat battery. My phone is a older model from 5 years ago so maybe new phone batteries can handle this game no biggie."", ""Does not open on my LG V-35.

Amazing game.', 'Was fun, but apparently draconian licensing kicked in after I had to reinstall after replacing my phone when it\'s screen got cracked. All I get now is ""Checking License"" and then it closes out. Who in their right mind puts such Digital Rights anullment copy protection on Android games? I even tried to email the developer feedback through the feedback link provided by Google play, but email bounced back to me. Please fix and I\'ll give a good rating.

If you change phones and want it switched, it's not going to happen...."", ""Not what i was expecting at all, i only did a few races but the cops would only target me and never went after the other racers.

Somehow it feels like I'm always getting a little better, always correcting mistakes, which keeps me from becoming bored. It's challenging in just the right way. I've completed everything in the game and I still like coming back to do hotlap and arcade. It's definitely worth the money."", 'Complete money grab. Not only did the developer pull RR1 and 2 to make it completely inaccessible to those who paid for it, but has also simply recycled the concept with new cars and maps and one new and fairly mediocre game mode at the expense of multiplayer.

Some nice details too."", ""Top notch. This game is fantastic fun. Exactly what you might want and expect from the advert.

Very enjoyable if you like to drift !', 'Would deffo be 5* if there was an option to race friends either with ghost times like bike race Pro or online against them.

Benefit from a bit paint rubbing and controlled powerslides!!! Seriously addictive', 'A must-have. The only problem is that this game is full of ""annoying little tricks"" the devs have inserted into this game. Walls attract your car. Even steering the car makes it perform a 180 sometimes, no matter how sensitive you set the controls. All of that to give you the fake impression this game will take longer to beat when it isn\'t that big or fully featured to begin with.

Drifting is the act of maneuvering a vehicle through corners at speeds and angles that exceed the vehicle’s grip. A drift is when a driver performs a controlled slide through corners while adhering to the racing line. Drifting involves fast cars, super skilled drivers and hardcore fans.

It’s a combination of driving skill, style and showmanship. It’s all about loss of the rear wheel traction while keeping the race car in total control. Drifting is so popular because it brings all the best aspects of motor sports into one package. Highly skilled drivers control a high powered street car past its limit, sideways at high speed, burning rubber. It can’t get any better!

Cars are difficult to control, with the tilt steering. The cars role over too easily, should be more of a spin out than role over. Could also use some damage to the cars when hit.

There's a nice selection of cars on offer here. Challenging tracks. A Championship Series and Challenge mode. Choice of difficulty to play and Number of opponents (up to 11 other cars on track at the same time.) You can also choose length of races to.  Controls - There is a learning curve as the handling here leans more towards simulation, you get a sense of achievement though once you have the controls mastered. This is stock car racing so smooth precise cornering, throttle control and a feel for the tires is the key to success.  Graphics - Simply fantastic graphics. The tracks and cars are detailed even at low settings and everything looks sharp. I've experienced no stuttering or slow down even on an old device. If you do experience any of this a clean up of your apps may help here.  Verdict - 5/5"", ""This is by far the greatest NASCAR racing game on mobil, but it could be better. Maybe add the option to customise your car's paint and decals. Also, make the steering a bit better. I have to tilt my phone quite a bit to turn the car just a little. Also, the cars in the game like to slow down on turns where they don't slow down in real life, such as in Daytona International Speedway, the cars slow down to 166mph where I am able to keep 181mph and not hit the wall. Could you add rolling starts and longer gas"", 'This game is sorta good, except that when you crash, there is no caution flag, so you have to get your car back in control and going fast, but that is hard to do when every other car has already passed you. Overall it is a good game, but it\'s the ""No caution when you crash"" thing that makes me sorta not like it.', ""For a paid game I expected a more realistic experience.

A few glitches but it can only get better"", 'My only suggestion is the ability to make multiplayer races via internet with a maximum amount of up to 43 cars per online race. Also, maybe more nascar tracks. Another possibility could be that you could give us the ability to make custom made cars. Also, I would like tire wear and a few coutions', 'Would be better if cautions were added.

Please fix these 2 issues. I have spent money on the game would love it to be fixed before i spend more', 'Amazing game, and ofcourse the developer did well with this. Strategy in the rain for tyres 0 choice between inters and wets, however for that lack of choice the rest of it is pretty solid, my drivers get 1-2 regularly, to the guy questioning if winning is possible it is, you just have to manage at the early stage with strategy.

No ads that I can remember, the micro-transactions aren't forced upon you. This is how mobile games should be made. Hope you make a football (soccer) manager game! Great work."", ""It's a very engaging and realistic game. Have been hooked to it for the past few weeks and the fun hasn't deminished!!!"", 'Fun challege. Some small niggles keep it from being 5 star. The ability to pause the game is great but when changing strategy on one of your drivers it unpauses. This is bad as the other driver can then overshoot the pit lane. Same niggle with after qualifying. I would love to see what my oponents times were after qualifying before making a choice on the tyre and engineering setup.', ""Are you guys gonna fix the stupidest gameplay ever where there's always this one opponent driver who just slides past you like going downhill without any other factor affecting them? It's always like one of them finds a way to catch me from 20secs behind and take a lead of 20secs all within one lap. Whatever upgrade I do to the three performance factors, it's of no use. One week, if this still keeps up am uninstalling."", ""Brilliant game, real in depth experience into the motorsport world. I feel the effect of tires in the game is not completely accurate and it would be nice to receive better driver feedback during the races as it currently dissappears to quickly. Other than that it's strategical and amazing"", ""A great overall starter to the Motorsport Manager franchise not to overly complicated for those just being introduced to the series of games but just complicated enough to lead you to your next purchase with enough knowledge to compete with each edition only getting better leading up too Motorsport Manager Mobile 3 and Motorsport Manager PC being the most well refined at the moment but don't get me wrong this game gives you plenty enough content to keep you entertained for days highly recommend."", 'Great game for anyone who loves formula 1 or other motorsports. Very easy to learn and fun racing simulator. If possible I would give 6 out of 5 stars!', 'Great simple game. The AI needs a bit of work when it comes to changing conditions and how fast they still can lap but overall a great game and concept. Downloaded the other 2 as I am almost finished this one. On the last GP series.', ""Great job devs. Wonderful game truly. Most realistic sim game ever, except for the graphics. But graphics don't matter when the managing is so real time. Cheers to u guys"", 'The best racing sim on a tablet. Enough simplicity to make the game easy to get into, enough depth to keep it interesting . Good visuals, easy interface', ""Been playing for a year now and its a very good Manager simulation game! Very challenging to over come some very good teams in the lower leagues but once your winning, you can't stop! 100/100 will definitely recommend to a friend :D""]"
Drag Racing 4x4,com.creativemobile.dr4x4,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.creativemobile.dr4x4&hl=en&gl=us,"Drag Racing 4x4 is the hit spin-off from Drag Racing, it features bigger and badder 4x4 trucks and SUVs, from the legendary Ford F-150 to the huge Monster Truck. You’ll get awesome burnouts and countless upgrades all on your Android device! Unlike other car racing games, this is real truck drag racing on the street and on the track. Challenge your friends and rivals online. 


<b>LOTS OF TRUCKS</b>
We know you love trucks and SUV's and 4x4 tires, so we've included the hottest brands in Drag Racing 4x4. That's right; Dodge, Ford, GMC, Infiniti, Land Rover, Nissan, Range Rover, VW and more! Sport SUVs? Check. Pickup Trucks? Check. Monster Trucks? You bet! The best part? There's always more of them coming.


<b>FAIR PLAY</b>
In Drag Racing 4x4 there's no ""fuel"" that you have to wait for. No ""delivery time"" for trucks or upgrades. Every vehicle is competitive and there's no ""premium"" upgrades. It's all about your skill and dedication. In Drag Racing 4x4 you can get Gold nuts to fix your truck when it breaks down, insurance to prevent future breakdowns and shields to save your tournament progress. Players can make the best 4x4 by testing the autotune feature to boost their performance.


<b>REAL RACERS </b>
Some people like to keep their truck in the garage, we like to race and be seen racing. Drag Racing 4x4 give you the best free online racing games can offer: there's always an online rival waiting for you. Pick your preferred language (English, Russian, German, French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Indonesian), Race any distance from 1/4 to full mile, win tournaments, work your way up the rankings, or test your nerves in wager races.

Happens every day on the streets of Drag Racing: 4×4.


<b>PERSONAL TOUCH</b>
Most games let you paint your truck. Some even let you apply a design made by someone else. How many games let you add Neon glow, chose from dozens of cool decals, arrange them the way you like and choose your own color for every bit? That's right - this one! 


<b>GET UNDER THE HOOD</b>
Are you a gearhead or a truck nerd? We have the most realistic physics engine in the genre, meaning that everything works the way it does in real life.

Like a 6x6 or something  that just sets this game off again."", ""Played this game on a tablet and loved it, so now I'm downloading it to my phone. I recommend this game to all my friends"", 'Needs more camera angles and more in depth mods.', ""Awesome game the only reason I'm not rating 5 stars is because there is room for improvement like rivers or creeks to crawl through mabey a mud pit or to plus the ability to design and build your own rig and a winch. Great game though perfect starting point"", 'I was playin for a couple days and on the third everything got really dark and i cant barely see anything its really annoying and i cant play like that its not my phone cause all my other games work besides the brightness its an amazing game i wish i could still play and be able to see.  Im using a Nexus 6', ""Paid for the game but no updates ever. No new content and no bug fixes.That should be standard. Last update was march 2014. Game is cool but becomes old fast. Needs more views. Other than the default view most are useless. Needs view from behind. Fast sections are pointless because there is no steering and u can't see far enough ahead. Should stick to rock crawling exclusively. Game is just hitting 1 button. However, the rock crawling parts are fun, just to easy. Should let players design their own tracks."", 'I don\'t even like side scrolling games but this developer makes some of the best games on mobile, so I wanted to support them in any way I could. And I\'ve noticed something lately and I\'m not racist by any means but the American companies male good games that are absolutely free with no gimmicks but the ""developers"" in other countries do everything they can to force you to pay ridiculous amounts that the games not even worth just because they\'re greedy. I\'m just glad to see that not everyone has adopted that pay model.

No controls other than gas and brake. For the same developers to have made the other gigabit Offroad, this is a disappointment. Only keeping it because I paid for it."", 'Great game. Not glitch at all. Love the realness.

After these few things are fixed and added I definitely wont hesitate to 5 star it.', 'Simply the best off road game out there. However it has it flaws... Very few but a couple. The biggest thing is there is never any big updates. 2 add more customization. Great game though and 2 thumbs up', 'Game is good,just have to get your settings right or you will drop in points really fast,just as fast as you get flat tires even at slow speed.you should make a pikes peak race,or a hill climb,not like all the cheesy ones on google play,like you see on tv,different vehicles,different hills,all trying to make it to the top.', 'I like the game but there are several times the game does very unrealistic things.  It is almost hard to race there have been numerous times I race the same map and I can make it through a section just fine then the next time it is completely different.', 'Great game except the throttle is off and the brakes are rediculous. Brake is way too much, you can go full throttle and punch the brakes and the car almost does a front flip which is wrong no tire lock up and slide like a real buggy. Gas is off also 3/4 and up is where the car actually moves anything under 3/4 is 5 mph which wrong. And from 100% throttle to 20% throttle the car  doesnt coast like it should, instead nails the brakes and it slows down way too fast picking up the back wheels. Fix=5stars', 'Addicted! Could use more vehicles modifications like tires, swampers boggers bf etc. And horsepower upgrades. Oh and a few of the southern states muddy rock courses. Also even better a navigator voice warning you when obstacles are approaching, specially on long straightaway.', ""Controls react very strangely. The brakes are stupid, And where's all the cars??

I remember when the gas and brake pedals were just there for that purpose and you had to use your devices built in gyroscope. Now with the Tilt. Controls gone, it makes it harder in my opinion to traverse the lands. This would be a great addition to the game on its next update if it gets one. Thank you for reading. 😁😁"", 'Love the game and put in the time to unlock all of the stages and vehicles, which most I was able to max out, but my issue is with the time and effort of collecting 500 gems to get a 500 gem container and mainly getting coins, rather than upgrading parts for vehicles from the garage, particularly Legendary, Rare, & Epic upgraded parts, which is very frustrating to say the least, fix that and get a five star rating from users of this game like me.', ""The tracks are fun and varied, the car selections aren't always about maxing performance so you can have fun seeing how far Santa and his reindeer can make it on an alien planet. Progress can be a little slow at first, but it speeds up after you get good at tracks and cars you enjoy driving. The one thing I absolutely hate is the custom car garage. In theory it sounds awesome, but slowly unlocking upgrade cards from chests, spending tons to upgrade, and then the cars aren't as good as basic cars"", ""I'm rating this game one star because I had this game for 4 years had my original email linked and it didn't sync any of my data from play games. You app sucks now. I hate every about this game because of this. It won't sync my cars or maps, I had almost every car fully upgraded, I had almost 3000 in in upgrades for the garage, its pathetic what your game has come to."", 'need another update...more hills more vehicles...got the update but see no difference. MORE vehicles...hills. Also, what\'s up with the ""event"" screen? Been up for almost a month. NO EVENTS!! Hurry up with the ""Events"" or take it down! UPDATE.... appreciate the new vehicle and hills...but still no ""events"". ??????', 'Literally the best game ever! I have invested entirely too much time into this game over the years... If it had one downfall it would be that I can\'t disable the coin collection sounds... I just want to hear those sweet engine and turbo sounds without the other nonsense.

I'm playing it for many years now, but from past some months, I've been facing a bug in which my race stops multiple times within a seconds and the game then crashes.

Then it started getting old. I'm 14 now and I got bored so I downloaded this game again. And now with all the new maps and stuff makes it 100 times better. I give it a 4 star rate bc it needs better cars and upgrades. But still one of the best mobile games"", 'I like this driving but there is some features are not available and some details of rules, like daily race or event and some car features are not matching.so,i happy if you tell us. Car driving is extremely fun. Sorry for something wrong.', 'When i was opening after installing it suddenly, i quit automatically. When i opended again, i was not able to play. Thus, i do not like it.

Why create so many ""exciting"" vehicles if some can\'t travel 200m on certain stages. That with it being upgraded. Create daily stages for specific vehicles or give more tracks.', 'Here\'s a suggestion. I understand that making the wing for Super-offroad durable will make it overpowered. How about a ""repair wing"" option under certain conditions like spending currency or diamonds so that we could enjoy Super-offroad and Dragster in later stages where terrain is actually challenging?', 'nice game . sometime when we are out of fuel or down the vehicle have motion and the fuel is near but you show is our statisticsi just played a challenge of 5000m in boot camp but got down amd the truck had motion u showed the stats we want u show stats only when the vehicle stops please please please add this in the next update . excepting this everything is fantastic', ""Awesome game no force adds witch is really nice it's also a pretty fun game I think it's better than the 1st one😊 Tips if you want to get good 1st get motocross bike then save up for moon then you'll get a lot of money from airtime but if you want more get moonlander it has thrusters so you can fly and get SO MUCH AIR TIME"", 'New characters shud b added to the game instead of that man sitn in the vehicle constantly. Also each character shud have a special trait, power or boost. Also there shud b an option to start from ur last point were u died.. Mayb if u add an extra life wich we can by with gems.

You can change vehicle as well as route."", ""It's a really good game but the only problem is when I get close to the crown then the hill is too high and then I stress and I don't want to play the game anymore."", 'The reason I am giving this game a 4 star is becauseit is hard to get money at first but when you unlock the moon level you get money super quick.

I would recommend it. Update: Played for a good while now, easily one of the best rally/racing games. Sometimes you find a game and wonder how has someone made a game that's so much better than others, and this is one great example."", ""Really good game, however, on challenge 20/35 really difficult to get the mini higher up the leaderboard to more than 2nd place, it's outpaced!"", ""It's definitely a great game. Feels like classic PSP game with twist of sega rally challenge. Only thing I don't like about it was asphalt felt like patched ice, and sometimes the challenge was inconsistent with its difficulties.

I recommend just pay the 99cents because if you get the lite version first and then decide to buy you lose your progress."", ""An outstanding and very challenging rally game with lush graphics.

I only wish there was a buggy vehicle to drive and play in.', ""still a great game and it's free. you pay for games and their rubbish, they need to learn from Pocket Rally it's not all about money."", ""unlike what some other people say, this is actually miles ahead of it's competition in terms of quality and I applaud you for being a dev that does not put microtransactions in a paid game."", ""as the challenge progresses, the ai is much more aggressive and they literally push you of the track and spin you around. it's impossible to finish a challenge."", 'needlessly boring... all cars and tracks locked out until you pass tests. Just want to play the game and enjoy it rather than sit an exam !!!! Same with your aeroplane game.', 'I liked the light version too much not to get this one.']"

---
The Earth is about to explode and Dr. Brainz needs your help. Take a seat in your advanced off-road transforming truck and tackle some of the most difficult terrains to gather the necessary artifacts needed to build the Magma Stabilizing Machine. 

Your journey will take you through several continents, from desert dunes to volcanic mountains and lush green hills, all spread over 60 action-packed levels. There are countless obstacles in your way but you are well equipped to overcome them. Your amazing truck transforms to different specialized machines:

- Off-road Truck – this is your default driving choice, a versatile, fast and durable truck that is best suitable for rough terrain, ramps and jumps. 

- Gun Truck – sometimes it's better to blast through obstacles than pass over them. Use your gun to clear a path through exploding barrels and debris.

- Drill Truck – sometimes even the mighty Gun Truck can't blast through tonnes of stones and concrete walls and this is where the drill transformation comes in handy.

- Helicopter – this special transformation will allow you to fly over difficult terrain.

Your different trucks are great but you can make them even better. Each of the 4 trucks gets a series of upgrades that will improve their characteristics. The upgraded wheels will increase the acceleration and top speed of your truck and more powerful guns will allow you to destroy obstacles faster. Upgrading all trucks will help you finish the levels in time. Unlike other truck racing games, Trucksform tests your reaction speed and decision making - learning how and when to transform will help you complete levels that otherwise seem impossible to finish.
