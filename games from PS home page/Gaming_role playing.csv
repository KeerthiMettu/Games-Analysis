Has all the feel and sights and sounds of a full blown Elder Scrolls game but in a mini-game setting. Oh, and the controls are easy enough to get used to. No, you do NOT have to pay to play. Like any game worth its salt, some grinding is required, but this game at least makes it interesting! Current lvl: 45 Cash spent: $0.00', ""It's very sad to see an Elder Scrolls game with less than 4 stars but as a long time fan and player, I agree with everything that has been said in the reviews. The game is buggy, crashes occasionally, the quest difficulty scale makes no sense, sometimes the game refuses to load(I have a flagship phone)...the list of issues is large. To the developers defence, they have definitely made some positive changes since the last time I played but it still isn't enough....unacceptable for a top tier dev."", ""Finally, a fantasy RPG that you can play the way that they were meant to be played...... The only drawbacks that I have personal problems with are; You can have only one character / account, the city itself is not expandable, (Face it, once you start decorating your city, you soon, 'too soon', run out of places to set them). A few other minor concerns, but those are the most glaring issues that I have found, so far. I love playing this game."", 'Fun, a lot more than I expected. Controls are pretty good, however combat is a bit slow at times having to wait for an enemy to either let their guard down or get in range. Love the way potions and skills are used as well. My only real issue is having to upgrade a building to craft better gear, as well as shop keeps not having enough money sell to. Overall fun and and the lore keeps me entertained.', 'The game was very enjoyable when I was lower level and before the recent updates. I am level 37, all the jobs are level 42+ and are too difficult too finish. Also before the updates only the lower level materials would drop and there was no way to increase my gear to make myself stronger, so I have a very weak character who can not handle the job that are available. I do know the game is still in development, but it is very poorly balanced almost to the point where you have to spend money to win', 'I used to love and play this game often. Couldnt play for a while; life circumstances. I just picked it back up and found that with the new update every job has a 5 skull difficulty when it used to be 1 to 3 skulls. And the level ""recomendation"" for both the jobs and the main quests are far out of my level. So, im expected to level up in order to do the main quest, but cant because the jobs that are used to level up are just as impossibly difficult? Can\'t even play anymore. 3 stars is generous.', ""It is a pay to win game. The jobs and quests become to difficult to complete. So much so that you have to buy gold and gems to better your equipment so you can complete the quests. I recommend that you don't download it. Waste of time. I uninstalled it. Very disappointed as I am a fan of dungeons & dragons. Bethesda this is your worst yet."", ""Unfortunately just a cash grab. The quests start off at a good difficulty level. Then they rapidly become way too difficult. I love and have played every elder scroll game. I've sunk some money into this game now but it's too greedy. After a quick Google, this issue has been spoken about since release and Bethesda said they'd balanced the quests. However they have not. My advice is; don't put any money into this game. Do the first couple of screens of quests then see the difficulty spike."", 'Overall the game is pretty fantastic, excellent graphics, easy to master weapons, spells and defenses... but the crashes!! Every battle when I kill the opponent the game crashes, then it takes another minute or two to reload so I can collect my loot and fight another opponent and repeat. Once the bugs are worked out this game will be pretty awesome! (Playing on the Note 10+, if that makes a difference) Update: this glitch can be fixed by turning off your wifi for a bit then reconnecting.', ""It's pretty awesome all round! Graphics are smooth and vibrant, the story is interesting and gameplay mechanics are straightforward. I wish I could use my controller even though im put would be over powered. I think the tapping to get to next place mechanic works well enough though and once you get the hang of it its fairly seamless. Just maybe have more filler q to get resources. But other than that its a ok! Thanks Bethesda for giving me a mobile game I finally enjoy. Skyrim mobile soon? ;D"", ""It's a pretty good game, even for early access. It crashes once in a while, or gets stuck and you'll have to close the whole app and come back, but that's to be expected. It's pretty simple while still presenting a fair amount of challenge, and there's always something to do. It's also incredibly easy to earn gems, which is a nice change of pace compared to other games."", ""I don't normally write reviews, but I figured I should set something straight about Blades. This IS NOT pay to play. I've seen a couple reviews now complaining about that and it's simply not true. I've been playing non stop for the last couple days, and I'm level 23. I've not been at all tempted to spend money on this game yet, and I don't think I will be. This game can be a grind, but that's part of it's charm. I was gonna complain about the audio cutting out, but they just fixed that."", 'After the last update when you open the chest menu in town or during a quest/job, it will try to make you go through the chest tutorial again. This causes the player to either open their highest level chest, or close the game. You could at least add a ""turn off tutorials"" option in settings. I am glad you fixed the audio issues, but still going to give you only 2 stars until the chest tutorial issue is addressed.', ""Bethesda's iconic stunning game play and graphics. Could definitely use more maps and because of this the quests get a bit repetitive (aside from the main quests). Leveling up is difficult and time consuming compared to the level req. of the following quests. The paywall becomes apparent as the difficulty raises and rewards thin out. Gradually I get less, decent equipment drops. Also, I wish speed was adjustable. Altogether, Blades is a beautiful & entertaining, but easy to get burnout game."", ""The graphics are awesome, the best i've seen in mobile games, but the game is badly optimized. Often it crashes and more than often fps crashes to 0. I am playing on a Redmi note 8 pro so it's high end up-to-date hardware. Drawing of the stages with crystals and foggy Alyeid temples seems too heavy on the gpu. Otherwise, i like the gameplay, sometimes i feel like i'm repeating stages even though it's another quest but overall it's a really good game with Morrowind wibe."", 'I remember seeing this game at E3 and was sooo 50/50 about it. I saw an ad on Facebook and decided to try it out and holy moly I am not disappointed. Mechanics are fluid, story is generally mediocre, but the quests and jobs never feel like a waste of time! You actually are genuinely rewarded for each one completed and the skill caps are there for a reason! 10/10 already recommended to family and friends.', 'I\'m a long time Scrolls fan and this game DOES have some nice features: good story, past series references, better graphics thank Skyrim. But there are SO many microtransactions for everything, that its difficult to get immersed without getting constantly bombarded with calls to purchase things from the game. Between all the announcements, reminders, and limited time offers, it feels more like a game interspersed with ""commercials"".', 'Update: adding the 5 preset slots was primo, adjusting the difficulty was not... Def really hard to advance in this game without investing some actual dollars into it. Update: Arena is challenging, maps still repeating but abundant. Weapon, skill, magic and jewelry switching is still a hassle Update: opened up arena section, lots more fun. Easy to play, grind is not too slow. I wish I could switch weapons faster when dealing with multiple enemy types. Maps are becoming repetitive.', ""There's just not enough to do. Running linear dungeons is great for a while, and building the town is alright, but it gets boring after about a week maybe two tops. Pulling loot from a magic crate that spews stuff along the side of your screen does not hold the same appeal as finding something cool in Oblivion or Skyrim. 2 *."", ""Excellent. Combat's a little wavy, or, floaty, rather, at first, and takes some getting used to, but is definitely fun. The character and armor models, as well as the soundtrack, and voice acting, are all magnificent. Five Stars, truly a genuine Elder Scrolls experience. Render unto Todd."", ""I absolutely love this game. It's a very good mix of a mobile game and the Elder scrolls experience without being to pushy. The only thing I'd like to see is a FOV slider. It's sometimes hard to take the entire environment in and would help with more fluid gameplay to pull the screen back a bit."", 'You have spent so much time into making it a money making game instead of just good old fashioned search and destroy. These controls are the worst!!! Framerate skips all over so I die be4 I can swing my weapon. Put a control for our v-cards (good,better,best). Put the controls to normal (left hand direction-forward, back, left, right)Point and go are never good in games like this. Look a ""Anima"" controls. I am so pissed right now, you have destroyed what used to be a good game.', ""EDIT. Still have the same wishes as noted below. But it hasn't crashed on me at all lately so they have fixed the bugs. Starting to really love playing the game. ORIGINAL...'Its OK. Fairly fun to play. Would be nice to have a map button. Also would be nice to be able to zoom out on your character. I find it crashes too often which makes it annoying to play sometimes. Specifically when you have to restart a mission.'"", 'The game play is good, and I like the arena. But after a certain point you can only upgrade your armor by spending money. I understand the concept of free to play, and have spent money on the game, but it would cost quite a bit to get good armor. Will probably have to stop playing because I cant advance.', ""1 - The game sometimes gets laggy or crashes when I'm walking in the scenario or in battle. I have perfect connection and a really good phone, so that's clearly an optimization issue; 2 - It's too hard to keep up with the difficulty curve as you level up and it probably gets impossible at some point unless you're extremely lucky or spend money (that's probably the goal here). I'm level 21, and judging by the enemies I'm facing, I should be way better equiped, but the expected loot doesn't come."", 'It was great, at first... It started off with the promise of being a fun mobile game, but it quickly turned in a heavy pay to play, even the main storyline. I hate to let this one go, but if I am going to drop $100 in a game to play a story line, I dont expect to do it twice.', 'Little buggy with the joysticks, combat and movement need to be fine tuned, and some definite framerate drops. But, for an early access, I enjoy it quite a bit. Should definitely incorporate a bit of lore, maybe with some books or in dialogue. Maybe, some quests with lore behind it.', 'Meh... Dungeons are too linear and character progression is just ok. Would of been better had the went back to their roots and dis something like Daggerfall. Edit: after giving this game more time, i ended up giving it 5 stars afterall. This game is the only mobile game that has not been uninstalled after a few days.', 'It becames unreal to play without money after 12-14 level. I\'m truly disappointed that Bethesda doing this way. All other game aspects are really incredible. Just maybe a little bit ""closed"" world and f**ed up timers. With all my love to the Elder Scrolls, it\'s just four start for now. I\'ll be happy to change it to five, if the game balance becomes friendly.', ""Edit: After some months of playing, my character is level 44, town level 9, no new quests for quite a while - just left with the repeatable (radiant) quests which are becoming tiresome. I'm not really a PVP fan, so the arena challenges really don't interest me. Original review: Great game so far, can't wait for the full release!"", 'Liked the game until it kept erasing my character and I have to start all over again. Not bothering to play it anymore. Went back after updates, seems some of the issues are getting better. Keep improving please. Is there any story updates coming. Finished main story ages ago.', ""I think this is to be said for most, if not all, mobile games- don't expect too much. It's good enough if you're just looking to pass some time while, e.g. at work or travelling, especially if you're already an Elder Scrolls fan. However, it's very repetitive and there's way too much emphasis on gems and the cash shop. Besides that, it's not too bad. But again, don't expect something legendary and/or breathtaking. It passes the time and is better than doing nothing at all or watching paint dry."", ""This game is a lot of fun. It's a nice change to the usual elder scrolls installments. The only problems I'm having now is that the abyss is the only mode with a reasonable difficulty curve and I'm constantly getting booted off despite having a newer phone, having four bars of four G and having gaming internet at home. What gives?"", ""Fun experience and exactly what I think elder scrolls should be. The micro transactions are ridiculous but that's to be expected with Bethesda (what happened?!) But OMG this app crashes every minute. Wanna change your gear? CRASH. Questing? CRASH. its almost unplayable. Almost"", ""Great game so far. But now had to edit due to lack of progress. I can't do quests because they are too high. I may get one every so often that I can do. Can't get materials to temper without quests. Or do anything else for that matter. Fix this or my rating will stay dropped and I will uninstall."", 'Great game visually , however I wish I could use my ranged spells or arrows from a greater distance you have to be right in front of all enemies , would be alot better with this small fix, also how are you suppose to sell your items when the only person , Smith runs out of gold early on ?', 'So I really enjoy the game, I actually love it. Unfortunately one of the quests is unable to open itself up. The silk farmer quest, I failed at first, but it had opened fine. After going back in to retry, the game started crashing with only that one quest. I hope it fixes itself, but definitely is a bummer.', 'I have played Elderscrolls games for many years and have been very patient with this game. Unfortunately, the more involved I become the more buggy the game becomes. And I get no response to my complaints about the issues.. so... my only choice is to cut my losses and move on. I feel taken advantage of.', ""Absolutely beautiful game, but since the update, the difficulty is all screwed up: 1 skull is killing me in 3 hits, 5 skulls I kill enemies in 3 hits. I can't access the arena. I'm unable to complete any jobs or c hmmm challenges due to the messed up difficulty. Hopefully next update will fix these problems. *changed to 3 stats because customer service has been responsive and great*"", ""It was a cool idea. Very poorly done tho. No use in crafting any new items because they will be out of date in 2 levels. Idk started off cool but the flaws are becoming very evident. Not customized enough. You're basically forced to using a shield. You don't have to but it helps too much not to. No dual wielding. Plus this last update is so huge and it's taking forever to download""]"

However, pull rates of 5-star characters is pretty low, and the in-game currency to pull for characters is hard to come by. Hopefully the devs will be more generous in the future. Update: devs have made big improvements to the game in terms of events and increasing rewards. Hopefully the trend continues.', ""Definitely addictive but a lot of Pokemon can't evolve and sometimes it feels a bit frustrating to use the gatcha as you get no bonus for a 10-pull unless you do the paid version, which is not cheap. Still fun on the occasion and the voice acting was decent. There is definitely a difficulty check, though. If you don't have a perfect team (especially if you don't have a perfect co-op, or no one queues for the same stage and you get AI) you won't win later stages. That feels a bit overwhelming."", 'Dont get me wrong, I love this game. I think the Devs are always working hard to get more content out, and take a lot of fan enquiries seriously. However, this can sometimes be part of the problem. I do not mind the grind, but the fact that every two weeks a new limited sync pair comes out purely to splurge some cash, instead of spreading out like they usually do, makes every new character seem worthless. Also, pull rates suck. However, I love everything else. The legendary events being my fave.', 'This is the best Pokemon game, the mobile has to offer(At least for now). The conttols are super simple and the amount of trainers you could get is beyond amazing. No pay wall and you can even become one of the top players if you just grind hard. No energy system that will limit your grinding and using money is just a way of supporting the devs. The design of the trainers is great including their personality, and the story is quite entertaining too. A good Pokemon game to spend your time!', ""Interesting battle system; endearing writing. Great game with a few things holding it back. In 70% of your battles you'll either utterly destroy or be utterly destroyed by your opponent, and the game does a really bad job of helping you predict which; when battles actually are close, they're really fun. Upgrade system involves confusingly many kinds of items, but they're handed out like candy so you barely have to keep track of them. Microtransactions exist but are very easy to avoid."", ""Game in general is becoming much more fun, but the main story has become worse in terms of content ever since it passed chapter 10. Theres been less and less main story to enjoy. Not to mention we don't have any sync pair thay can do and AoE sync move and its always the AI that can do it. Therefore it gets one less star from me. The events however have been superb."", 'Great Pokémon game. Well designed and interesting story! The game builds on the main canon with a well-written spinoff. Although being a gacha (you have to roll - scout - to get sync pairs) the devs are active and responsive. Overall very satisfied with the general quality and the battle system. I have to give it a 4🌟 rating due to compatibility issues: not everyone who seems to have a fitting phone is able to download and play the game. Once that is fixed, this is definitely a 5🌟 for me!', 'Although not perfect, that is to be expected from a game still relatively young in its development. Personally I really like the game so far and with all the updates as of recently. Props to the team for listening and working closely with the pm community, and you can really tell that DeNA/pm team puts in a lot of effort and heart into the game such as with the amazing music and little intricate game cannon details.', ""Generally a fun game. But they separate their in game currency for progression (gems) between paid and nonpaid. For a game that's starting out, giving out events for alpha players, they have promos for specifically paid gems only. Too bad, theres so much potential. Rather than cater to the multiple microtransactions of the many, they will rely on the microtransactions of the few whales. Such a waste."", ""I love this game! It has a cute story and is constantly adding new trainers. People have to understand this isn't one of the traditional Pokemon games. It's not meant to be. It a great mobile app to pass time which is what the purpose is. It's goal driven and requires patience as well as skill and even a little luck. If you're aware of and understand it is a new game that is constantly making updates, you're going to enjoy it!"", 'Would love to write a proper review for this but was only able to get in 10 mins of relatively promising gameplay before getting network error 20101, despite my connection being absolutely fine, I cant even log into the game because I also get this error, needs a fix ASAP. Will update review if fixed', 'Game is great, however I suggest the following things to make it more in line with other gacha games: Allow multi pull to provide guaranteed 4 star or above to allow incentive to roll. Its very disappointing to save up the in game currency only to get all 3 star cards. PvP against other trainers. Joint team boss battles/events. Guilds/groups to party with your friends. EDIT: the new changes bumping this up from 2 stars to 4 stars! They reading the fans comments which is great!', ""It's a great idea, and honestly I'm enjoying the characters & their personalities (especially the ones that really lacked them in their original games). The graphics are great & the voice acting is well done! I am really having fun with the new events & updates to make your sync pairs stronger! However, it's not perfect. It does need to continue the story, offer more variety for new characters, and add a PvP option rather than just a co-op mode. Thankfully, the directors are improving the game!"", ""Definitely enjoying the game, especially playing with characters I know and love from the series. Only wish the game didn't lag so hard. My phone is relatively high end, but the game is very choppy and slow, which often makes playing, especially co-op, frustrating. Other than that, fun game."", ""Before they listened to customer feedback, I would've given it a 2.5/5. I really appreciate that they listened to us and have given us more adequate rewards, great, free units, and have added more for us to do. My one gripe is that the summoning rate is awful. I think that needs to be adjusted, as well as the chance of you summoning a character you have maxed out being lowered."", ""Love this game. One of, if not the best free to play character collection games I've ever played and set in one of my favorite universes. My only complaint is that even with a good team the enemy sometimes feels a little to strong when doing the harder difficulty stages. Like how come I can hit the enemy for like a 3,000 crit and it hardly scratches them but they can one shot me with only 300 damage. Otherwise no complaints."", ""This is such a fun and cheerful game. I love the light hearted story, and the nostalgic characters. I've played pokemon all my life and I just love how they've given personality to the characters. It feels like they really love the source material. Some people may find the writing childish and cringy, but I just love it. Pokemon has always been about striving to better yourself and being optimistic. They update the game regularly and give you time to complete things. Also, no energy to timegate."", ""For all the old Pokemon fans! This game is truly fun and entertaining but it's nothing like old Fashion pokemon games. Since you aren't able to be in a open world and be able to go all around. But I'd say the battle aspect is a lot similar, but your in a 3 way battle. Pros: all our favorite characters and more are in this pokemon phone game, entertaining for the most part being able to see blue and red. And even professor Oak. Cons: It gets a little boring after a while. And updates gosh."", ""I find myself not being able to put my phone down. I'm a completionist and when I see the !! On all these things I just keep clicking through. Obviously very repetitive and is why I'm doing 4 rather than 5 star. Overall a fun and engaging game."", 'Hello there! I have been playing this game since it was in BETA stages and I enjoy this game back to the first day I downloaded it. My feedback to further improve this game is suggesting applying an Auto-REPEAT after completing courses only in the Training Area. Please make it happen. Thank you! No changes regarding about suggestion in adding the feature Auto-REPEAT.', ""So far I am having fun with the game. The experience is fun and the layout of everything in game is concise and makes sense. The story is pretty interesting so far and character interactions are also interesting. Starting a new account isn't hard either, so overall I think the game is one that everyone should at least check out!"", ""The gacha system sucks starting from the latest update. It says pokemon fair event with 10% chance to get 5*, but actually its getting worse. I got only one 5* trainers out of 6 attempts, where previously it was one 5* out of two or three attempt. I've played this game since Aug'19, now I have the reason to uninstall this game. It was very unfortunate for i was quite enjoying this game"", ""Gives me the feel of the old pokemon games alittle with an interesting story and a new twist with the scout trainer system. I'm loving getting new trainers with my favorite pokemon from both new and old games. My only complaint is that it is hard to get trainers you dont have even when scouting times 10. Plenty of times I have gotten the same 4 or 5 star trainers for all 10 rolls even when there are new ones that drop."", ""So far, I've enjoyed the game! I can't rate it at five stars due to me only being in the first few chapters of the games story. Also, I've noticed that the sync partners that you can purchase in the store don't seem to have a very good RNG at times. I haven't purchased any with real money, but rather, I've bought them with the free in game currency. This game is solid, and I do recommend it to anyone who likes a bit of a grind and pokemon."", ""To the DeNA and Pokemon Masters TEAM. I really like the game. 1. Make the points needed to select any sync pair you like be permanent. wherein it doesn't need to be wasted after the event. Also make the points stack up on all events not different points on diff events. 2. Make gems easier to obtain. 10 or 50 gems rewards and needed 3000 gems to summon sync pairs is too much. 3. More importantly. Make it possible to get voucher for power ups of legendaries on daily basis, NOT LIMITED TIME ONLY"", ""Auto grind simulator, but otherwise very interesting gameplay mechanics that makes it feel pretty distinct from the main series games. Also, it's become more and more polished as time has gone on, with great events and content to boot."", 'Update: 2-21-2020 Game balance is much better and many units that are not Strikers have moves or abilities which allow for the Striker unit to perform even more optimally. There seems to be constant events lately which I appreciate. Over a month since returning and I am still working at keeping up. It feels right to me now. I really hope events of the past that released new characters, like Solgaleo, return since I missed out.', ""This game has a lot of potential. I love what I've played so far. The biggest issues for me is the gacha portion. The rates are good but it takes forever to draw. I feel like we should get more for missions that way there's more reason to do them. Also if I'm paying $30 it should cover 2 ×10 draws. Seriously that's like 75% of Lets Go for 10 draws. And as someone that has paid for gems, please get rid of the whole paid gems thing. It's dumb. Do a free or discounted first draw instead."", 'Actually really impressed with the game. extremely long time fan since the release of the first games as a tike, story is well executed for both child and adult players , has a great and ever growing collection of trainers and partner pokemon (sync pairs) leveling and evolving system is great, stays true to characters of the series . Not an extreme cash grab as most players will lead you to believe', 'Good pokemon type game. Seems like a knockoff, but ive tried tons of knockoffs, and this is among my top 3. Only took me about 12 hours to max out over a dozen pokemon, and get to the end of every progression path. I plan to play it through at least one more time, if not many more, if that doesnt say it all. One of the too few shining beacons in what was the dark period of january, 2020. Definitely recommend!', ""I'm new to Pokemon (started with Go and have now played Shield and LG Eevee) but I'm really enjoying what you get for free with this game. I have only been playing for maybe 6-8 hours of gametime but it's been fun and challenging without feeling like I HAVE to buy anything. I'm more likely to spend money on a game like that. But we will see what things are like when I am more progressed."", 'Update: The game has gotten immensely better. There are more login rewards and rewards in general, more events with useful items available to gain, and there\'s even a new feature to better improve your character\'s stats. Definitely not just a ""login for your daily rewards"" kind of game anymore. I\'d recommend it to anyone who\'s into mobile role playing games. Thank you DeNA!', ""As someone who has been experiencing the Pokemon world for almost 20 years I gotta admit I love that they still bring new and exciting ways for you to train in the world of Pokemon. I love that there is no energy keeping you away from endlessly playing all day. I like that the system has auto play modes as well to help me do work and play! I'd give this a five but I can be stingy with money and I'm not a fan of $30 for 10 scouts ."", ""Very interesting way to make a pokemon game. Liking the breath of fresh air the serie received. For me the best part is the character development. It's really cool to be able to hangout with the gym leaders, they have so much personality now, that's awesome. Also, Rosa thonking XD. The only negative point I had in the past was the fact that co-op and co-op events where so annoyingly difficult. But now with the extra level uncap it's a little better. But the lag on co-op is still very bad."", 'The gameplay is fast, easy to get into, and it\'s nice to see old characters come back more fleshed out than before. My only gripes is that there aren\'t any emojis in co-op that ask your teammates to do specific things such as ""target this trainer specifically"" or ""use your trainer moves"". Also they need to let us exchange gym leader notes for elite four notes. The drop rate for them is just too rare to reliably farm them.', 'This game is extremely fun. I love everything about it, and it runs well on my phone. However the only concern I have is that when I open the shop it takes a long time to load compared to everything else. It also takes a long time to open up the sync scanner. Overall the game is very good and Im hoping for a fix in the future.', 'Uninstalling, not impressed with 5 updates before I even really start to play and learn game. When 1st installed the game and opened, I had a update to go back to app store then 2 more opening game again. Once u start getting teammates, it wants u to do another major update. This games over 1.5gb memory once u do all these updates. They should all be included in 1 update. Very Unhappy!!!', ""For real, if you're a fan of the characters in the pokemon games you're going to adore this! It's like a wholesome fanservice, I'm addicted. It's nice to see the od gym leaders, champions and even players and rivals like Barry and Rosa return! I just love the games, and I don't wanna look up some spoilers to see if my favorite is here yet (N) but I'm loving it already ❤❤❤❤❤ thanks guys"", ""Incompatible with Android 10. No response to email requesting support after 12 hours. Wouldn't transfer saved data to another phone. No response after asking for help there either. Fine game until I couldn't play it anymore. Update: 4 stars for it working again. Fun game that reminds me of the classic Gameboy versions. Lost all of my saved data when I updated to Android 10 though. Edit 2: The updates have really improved the game. Really appreciate the updates and constant work."", 'The game is very well made with very high production values. It is nice to see the character is given interesting personalities. The gameplay though is just put on your auto and grind. There is nothing to do and no choices to make other than grind or install. I thought they were going to fix the gameplay but they certainly have not.']"
Eternium,com.makingfun.mageandminions,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.makingfun.mageandminions&hl=en&gl=us,"Eternium is an amazingly fun and beautifully crafted Action RPG, reminiscent of the great classics.

Eternium stands out from other mobile Action RPGs by its effortless “tap to move” and innovative “swipe to cast” controls, and its player-friendly “no paywalls, never pay to win” philosophy.

With the exception of a couple of online-only features, the game can also be played offline after the content download completes.

Drawing signs to cast spells is easy and rewarding. The tap-to-move control is more natural and relaxing than thumbsticks, and it’s also truer to the vintage point-and-click Action RPG experience.

The game can be really played for free, as more than 90% of our players do. Purchases are completely optional. Gems, the game’s main currency, can be collected from enemies and quests. There is no limiting stamina or energy. The best things in the game are obtained by playing, not paying.

As of fall 2017, major new features are in advanced stages of development, including real-time multiplayer, town portal, and a fourth world.

Enjoy the visceral satisfaction of responsive, fast-paced combat, with spectacular special effects, pleasing sounds, rewarding damage numbers, all set against immersive backdrops and atmospheric, inspiring music scores.

Play as a Mage, Warrior or Bounty Hunter, wielding a sword, axe, staff or gun. Level up to learn new abilities and increase your attributes.

Battle skeletons, zombies, automatons, aliens, demons, dragons and many other creatures, across three beautifully hand-crafted worlds, or in endless generated levels.

Venture into dark caves and dungeons, explore forests, villages and graveyards, lay siege to demon controlled castles, brave snowy mountain peaks, travel to the moon to slay strange creatures among craters and canyons, and beyond, to the deserts, pyramids and jungles of the red planet.

Open treasure chests to loot gold, gemstones and battle gear. Equip shiny breastplates, menacing helmets and hoods, spiked shoulder pads, mysterious cloaks or capes. Protect yourself with a shield, or choose to wield two weapons as a warrior.

Rescue your tank, healer and ranger companions who will join you in battle. Use their abilities together with yours to create rewarding and powerful tactical combos.

Experience a refreshing storyline, filled with interplanetary intrigue and seasoned with funny characters. Hunt your arch-enemy, Ragadam, across the worlds, while trying to uncover and undo his twisted plans.

Progress from common to rare, epic and legendary gear. Find gemstones that fit in your armor’s sockets. Craft socketed rings and amulets, and fuse three of them into a higher quality one.

Unleash awesome offensive abilities, such as Whirlwind, Shockwave, Arc Lightning or Blizzard, control the enemy crowd with Frost Nova, Vortex, Silence, or sneak and assassinate with Smokescreen, Traps and Snipe.

Each hero class has access to about 20 abilities (skills or spells), and each of your three companions has four more. The game starts simple, but culminates in a flurry of tactical possibilities at high levels.

Once your hero reaches level 70, your experience points go into Champion Levels, which are unlimited and yield steady stat upgrades. Champion Levels are also inherited by your new heroes, so they will have an easier time growing up.

Aside from the three story acts, an endless progression of beautiful, randomly generated levels awaits in the Trials of Valor game mode.

I've played a lot of Rpgs in my life and can say that this game is average, it's not a bad game but not a classic either. Tbh, I've had this game for 2 weeks and I'm getting a tad bored with it already. The gameplay is decent enough, the story I couldn't care less about and the equipment is repetitive. It'll keep you occupied for a short while."", ""The game is a nice light ARPG with an interesting draw gesture system. The crafting system is great as well The game is much too simple however. The most important thing in a video game is CHALLENGE. Without it there is no fun. I dont want to blitz through levels one-shotting everything. That is not fun for me. Make enemies adapt to the player's power level and allow players to select any difficulty they want from the start. These 2 things will allow players to customize their experience better."", ""So far (about 90 minutes), really good. Gameplay is simple and fun. It easy to level up the first levels, and enemies are not overly tough. I don't know whether it gets more difficult later or not. The adverts are optional and you receive gems if you choose to watch them. Otherwise, you can choose not to watch them and simply continue with your quest. My favourite element is that this is NOT pay to play. Nor is it watch ads to play either."", 'This game is perfect the way that it is Its like playing Diablo. The controls are very easy The quests are simple to follow. No constant every 5 minute ads pop up. You only get ads when you find a mystery box to get more gems. And trust me its worth the watch you need gems to unlock stuff and makes the game easy to play. I really enjoy playing this game. I been playing it for days hours I recomend playing this game You can add friends when you complete a level. Theres so much more to it.', ""So far playing the game has been pretty fun the micro transactions have not been to bad the gems you get are plentiful if used right and you dont have to pay money to get through the game . The graphics are good,the controls are pretty good only complaint about them is the fact if you back up with a range character it doesn't auto hit you have to tap again to hit them . I highly recommend this game it's like a pc/console RPG but with the normal mobile stuff in it. My review may change...."", ""Gameplay is entertaining until you reach a certain level and then it's just a heck of a hurdle to get past, esp. when there are few tutorials or info for the game. Also some of the quests I've completed I've had to repeat over and over again as if I had skipped them, and I know for certain that I completed those quests. And DAMN, Elban is a sonuvabitch to beat in comparison to the rest of the game so far. 3 stars. 🤷🏽\u200d♂️"", ""Very nice game for a few ours. But when reaching lvl 50 and above it's pay2win part gets annoying. To unlock necessary inventory space or just a simple spell ability it costs so much, that it's not possible to reach it without paying. (even watching ads isn't helping). Would love to see that game with a one time payment of ~10-15€ which removes all in game pay2win options"", ""I never write reviews on mobile games. I mean never. This review should say something then. I primarily downloaded this to play during down times at work but I found myself pulling this up at home. It's a hub based rpg and very easy to use controls and features a very interesting way of using abilities via symbols. You can build a party, craft, transmog your gear etc. Everything you'd want in a mobile rpg. In app ads aren't intrusive and you're typically rewarded for watching short vids. 5/5"", 'First off I am loving this game. With that being said I have a few suggestions. 1. Less time to wait for abilities or no time at all. 2. Bank tab markers. 3. Higher gem drop rate, the ones you need to add sockets and buy chestes 4. Make it so after you get all five stars on all levels all chests are openable. 5. More achievements for gems. I hope this helps. Thank you for a great game. I still continue to play every day.', ""I have often had trouble finding good RPG games. This game however, is certainly high on my list. It is simple in gameplay yet woven together in a very effective way that captures the intended effect. It has a good storyline, gameplay and is overall hard to find any observeable flaws with. I am highly doubtful that other players would regret installing it, I certainly don't."", ""If you love quest games I swear to god this is it, they dont have ad, they dont try to get you to buy something every 5 minutes, you receive gems through out your play, and did I mention no ads. I grew up on these types of games and I still love them at 27 y/o. Thank you Eternium for giving me a game I'll never get bored or tired of."", ""If I had paid for this game there would be some irritations with some design choices (like upgrading one power at a time) but for a free game this is damn good.

If you're patient, no cost, no risk, just a great game"", 'If you are a fan of old-school hack and slash, Diablo-like RPG..then this is the perfect game you must play. Many have been addicted lately (so am I heh).. No ads, definitely not a pay to win game cuz i have never spend a single penny on this game yet i was able to beat it. Kudos to all devs for creating such a WONDERFUL AND BRILLIANT game. Please add more Classes if possible.', 'Played for quite a while, it did not grab me. As others have said it\'s pretty linear, not really imaginative, not especially interesting gear system from what I\'ve seen. It could get better for all I know, but ads and ""offers"" and hitting walls before you\'re particularly entertained = uninstall. I\'d rather just pay upfront for a full game and risk wasting my money... I hope this microtransaction phase passes eventually.', ""Lack of customization, 30$ pay wall to enjoy content that should've been there already. No multiplayer, useless campaign that you dont even have to do. Simply farm trials and dungeons. Campaign is obsolete, severely boring and gold rate is very slow. Game becomes repetitive, no guilds, not lots of dungeons. Only 1 in game to grind. The game is very small minded, greedy, and lacks extensive content. Until you make the warrior not look like an old grandma and only 1 ability. This is 1 star."", ""Loved the concept, and playability. I did not like, that I made it to level 22 without using more than one or two appples, plus maybe one potion to recover health the whole time. I don't want to be slaughtered, but i wanna work for my successes."", ""The game is beautiful. The controls are a little strange to play with at first, but make sense after the second of third level. The pace of play is amazing and the gems are easy today find. This is the first true play to win mobile game I've found."", 'Minor issues due to the age of the device I\'m playing this game on; but apart from that no real problems.

For me I play smart and it's way to easy ,2 hrs in and i am a tank ...Besides that this game is alot of fun and similar to Diablo . I just wish it was a bigger challenge .I would recommend you try this game out."", ""The items and crafting are done really well! The game looks alright too but feels dated compared to newer ARPG titles. Cons: Movement is the worst and number one reason I can't keep playing or recomend this game. The lack of control options to move and attack using your thumbs. But u play the entire game with your pointer finger. Gems are the premium currency that you NEED use to improve far to many quality of life options. Many I feel like should be unlocked using Gold or after quests."", 'This game is fun and entertaining! I have almost finished one run through and I love the graphics and game play. Buuuuuuut, every time I attempt to play the very last level, it crashes when I hit the start button!! Gaaaah!!!!', 'I reinstalled the fame after a year still there is not much content but a lot of quality of life improvement, i hate to see this game put to rest there is so much potential. The developer has should put more ads choices eg the skill leveling or ads for refreshing recipe instead of five gems because it breaks immersion watching ads in the middle of the raid. Its better if u can watch the ads during loadout', ""Are rated 5-stars so I can get the gems that's the only reason. It's cool enough that it's occupied me for a while... but I'm only venturing through it to see if getting past the normal stage of the game actually has you take damage. So far it's been extremely elementary feeling. Playing the game without fear of death takes away the spice and adventure. Game is long and repetitive and the options at the vendors in town are rather remedial."", ""So far really enjoying the game. Visuals look great. I do like how gold and gems are shared between your toons so you don't have to do major grinding. But I'm still early in the game, so that could change. Other than that, a solid game."", 'Great game easy mechanics and good graphics, and one of the good parts of the game is that you could adjust the graphics and its so awesome and cool adding the great gameplay and the monsters are quite unique in their own way and so is the level designs.', ""Eternium's game save feature where you need to create an account is a joke. Issue was solved with support Great game but Still a useless issue in my opinion. Aggravating non the less. So 3 stars. There should be no need to create an additional account. If the devs want to draw people to there website they should try other methods Google play offers cross platform game play already with some games already."", ""The game is a little simplistic, but it doesn't seem to rely too heaviliy on Gem purchases. The gameplay is quite easy to grasp, and the gesture system is a good way of controling your character (especially if you're using a stylus). I don't know how long it will keep me entertained for, but time will tell."", 'Nice ""Diablo"" style game, I was looking for something like this for a while, currently enjoying the few first easy quests with an upgraded purchased weapon that was so cheap and irresistible, 4 stars because gem rewards are very little and upgrading abilities takes a lot of time.', 'AWESOME GAME!... My hero is at level 11, so far I can play and have great fun & success with this game w/o buying anything! Occasionally I watch brief videos to earn gems, but not too many. This game has so many great options when playing. Graphics great!', ""I'm rating 5 stars to get the 50 game is if I have to just rate it or give 5 stars for gems so I did both, but the game is good I wish it had a joystick so you can move where you wanted without clicking but that only takes spittle away from the game if I was to give it a real rating it would be 3 3/4 star because it's defiantly a good game but could be better with a few changes"", ""I've had this game for years now and awhile back I put tons of grinding into getting really good gear back when you fused everything and put in a lot of time and had a lot of left over items to continue the process but my phone messed up and I got out of the game for awhile and now everytime I come back the game is completely different and all of the money and gem (currency), and time used to make those left over items went to waste. Idk, it just doesn't feel like the same game."", 'Worth the Download!! Downloaded it on a whim. Glad I did. While there are a multitude of mobile games committed to vamping your wallet, this is not ONLY NOT one of them, but its story and character customization is pretty fun. Gameplay is great!', 'Absolute blast. It is a bit like Diablo type of a game, there is something priceless about it however. It can be played offline, no tricks. Beautiful graphics and music. Highly recommended. Great to play on the go. Some texts a bit small but it depends on screen resolution.', ""I hate pay to win/play. This game doesn't leave me feeling like a cash cow, easy game play, enjoyable, no stupid farming/waiting. Totally optional to buy gems, very low pressure offers. Appreciate that aspect so much that I made a purchase to show my appreciation."", ""Having lots of fun.

It\'s a pretty simple app in terms of control and user interface, but is creatively dazzling. Thank you for sharing your art!!!!', ""I like the whole artstyle and aesthetic, though there's not much to do, but what do you expect? It's specifically an avatar portrait maker, not an RPG. Sucks you gotta pay for half the stuff- though I'm pretty sure you can unlock everything by watching ads, if you're patient. Also there's a bug where I can't get the blush to permanently remove. I'll remove it, save it, then when I look at it later it's back again -_- fix it."", ""Makes your character live--AMAZING! However, there are some problems. 1. Please add a confirm button for Load and Update buttons. Not only are they close to each other, they also look similar. I've lost many characters pressing on the wrong button. 2. Sometimes the background and clothes of the avatar change after being loaded. Fix these two problems and earn 5 stars! :D"", ""Don't get me wrong, this app is great. I use it in regards to my characters since I'm more writer than artist. This rating would be five stars, except every time I have to uninstall this app due to lack of room on my phone or changing phones, I lose anything I earned/bought. I bought them back twice before I gave up. If you could tie purchases to the Google account, this would be five stars."", ""This is a great app! It is one of my favorites. But there is one REALLY annoying thing about this. I don't know why, but whenever i use the ombre effect for the hair it works, but when i save the portrait and load it, the hair turns back to one flat color, so I can't use the ombre effect to make my portraits which sucks."", 'Amazingly impressive, almost everything has a control and the options are great and easy to handle and get the hang of. I have previously had this and just uninstalled it not too long ago because I ran out of space due to other apps, but got it again and I\'m wondering if there\'s a way to recover my previous saves and features I bought with the ""star"" currently I got by watching videos?', 'This is a good app. To get stars in this game you could pay money or the alternative, you could watch ads. I like to go on this app when I am bored and it is very fun to make people because there are so many features.', ""So this game is amazing! I love it and love the boy version. I'm currently writing a story and this app really helps me imagine how my characters may look like before I sketch them out. However I gave it 4 stars because it needs more options. Like I said there's nothing wrong with this game and it's amazing, actually it does have plenty of various options, but what I mean is that perhaps it needs a little more options for the nose and the mouth and that's all. Thank you and enjoy everyone Xxx"", 'I love this app but hate that it closes out randomly on both my tablet and cellphone. Then you lose all your progress. I\'ve had to remake like 5 girls. Also pls make more clothes choices. Also yall shoule make a ""Are you sure?"" Option before for the Update button because it sucks accidentally losing all your progress with one touch, ya know... sad lmao', ""This app was fairly easy, I do say the fact that these characters continue to blink instead of staring directly into your soul is a wonderful feature! These people look more lively then most avatar creators out there and that is spectacular. Controls are decent though I had found it confusing at the beginning keep making games like this and you'll be the greatest app inventor yet!"", ""Its really fun to play because you can change what they look like and its just thw best game id ever played in my life its really fun the you can change everything about the chaters and it my fav part when you can change the hair the lips and clothes and eyes i play this game all the time i get on my phone i don't know why its just like really really really really really fun and one of the best its one of the most games i play out of all ot the other ones the hairs are really nice and the eyes"", 'Decent but leaves a lot to be desired Cons -Having to watch lots of ads to unlock basic things unlike the boy version -Bugs. One of the effects never works for me, the water thing, none of sliders work on it. Other times you can lose progress on your doll -Lack of customization. Especially with clothes -The update+load buttons are incredibly similar Pros -Still probably the best dollmaker here, with the art+available customization Keeping all this in mind, I would still suggest trying it out.', ""I love the app so good but I think if I want the girl not to have bangs I can't get rid of them also I think there should be where you can do her whole body also if you do put the whole body on the next update on the next update please fix where the clothes and vampire teeth are available because I want to do that also add more clothes and accessories."", ""I'd rate this a 10/10 but maximum is 5 so yea keep in mind I rate it a 10. Its really really fun and cool. I love how you can change almost everything about the character. Good job!"", ""It's a really great avatar maker, it even allows you to make notes about the character. But the reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because their isn't that many options for the hair and clothes. Other than that though, it's an amazing app! 😊"", 'I think this app is great! Its really fun and you can customize and make changes to your liking. I love how you can make as many characters as you like and the doll like features just put it all together. Fantastic graphics and I definitely recommend if your creative!', 'To be honest, I dont enjoy dress up games that much. But this one takes the cake. It works great, the art is gorgeous, and it has given me so much art Inspiration! A great experience.', ""I love the app, I really do, but i tried to purchase the 2000 star pack, and it didnt register. I did so a second time, and got the 2000 stars. However, it has now charged me twice, when I only got one payment's worth."", ""It is great for what it is though. One app can't be expected to do EVERYTHING. Wish there was an undo button. No dreads or other hairstyles like that if so I would've given it a 5 star. Also wish they had a open jacket option like the male one. Wish their was an easier way to match the colors of bang & hair."", ""I love this game but it did have its ups and downs I wish you didn't have to pay for stuff I wish and hope someday in the future that I Ethier get all the items that cost stars or the creator gets ride of the cost all in all it's a great game and you will have a great time playing it is very enjoyable and you can lose track of time playing it great way to spend time and use your creativity."", ""It's really fun and has a lot of options it also has things like filters backdrops and even more you can pick your own colours for everything including brightness or darkness of those colours it looks so realistic to she looks like a real girl I do recommend you download the app because it's fun and gives you a lot to espesially when you're board and have nothing to do it really does have a lot to bring to the table with no adds that are to annoying and that bearly show up it's a 10/10 app enjoy"", 'This is a good game . i used to use it to design all my characters but now you have buy stars in order to use cirtain features ( with is a lot of them) and they all used to be free . you can earn stars by watching ads but you only get 5 stars per ad and most features are around 50...', 'This a very high quality Portrait Design/graphic design through controls to alter the shape, skin tone, all facial features, hair style and color, and various other extras & backgrounds The artist can then take photos and or make gifs.... Worth downloading .. thank you', ""This game is............ AMAZING there's so many customizing options and the detail it's too good I am a big biiig person when it comes to attention and detail and you have nailed it the style of art and the way everything was made just makes me so happy this goes for both games"", 'AMAZING!!! But i think there should be a way to get stuff without spending money like mini games that give you stuff if you get a high-score', ""I love this game it is the best. I play it, like 5 or 3 times a day. I mean who dosen't like to play fun games like this?.😁. Oh and whoever u are ,and you love to play this game make sure to give it 5 starts. Again 5 STARS . this game i think deserve's a good 5 stars so let's hope this everyone give it AGIN 5 STARS 😁"", 'Good app, fun, has good options. It wont let me play very many adds to gain stars, it stops giving me adds and tells me to check the connection when its fine. Besides that, its perfect. Hope more things are added later.', ""A real lifesaver to figure out what characters look like (and have some fun with the portraits), especially since you can change the size, position, etc of everything so it's much less limiting than other portrait apps. Very nice to use."", ""I love this game because you don't have to buy was real money you could just upload it and play I have too much fun that's what I think everybody who doesn't have five starts maybe you guys cannot be in one of my YouTube videos cuz today I'm going to put a new game is going to be you can't but it's on us going to be on 11 no on 10 okay that means please don't listen to the 11 just ignore cuz I'm going to pick a winner to be in the video by"", ""Uhm...it's really good and I love it it's just...after a few minutes, or seconds, if I switch tab, had a lot of progress on it....it restarts and it's really frustrating!"", ""Great game! Very fun, I just wish there were more ears, tails and wings. Overall however, it's a great game that you can play 24/7 and still not be tired of it --both versions--."", 'This is by far my favorite app for creating oc !! You can play without paying, the graphics are really good, honestly a really good app!! Would definitely recommend!!', ""It isn't as anime girly as I wanted it to be and when it comes to the Male version they have a higher variety of clothes and misc items. In this you need stars and I have know Idea how to get them so, good game just needs a few upgrades❤"", ""It's one of the most creative games ever. Not the best experience. I would not give it 5 stars because Its kind of boring. Ieould not recommend it . There are much better games out there and these are not one of them."", ""It was so fun. I could just pour out imaginary characters onto the screen. I would write backstories for each character and the characters I made we're great inspiration for writing. All in all I loved it"", ""I love this, I'm a kpop fan and I made a lot of portraits of kpop idols example:-blackpink, bts, red velvet, got7, twice, exo, etc:, i made male kpop idols in the guy version of this game, I literally love it there were some slot bugs but now it's all good🙂"", 'Its a great and realistic app. But i and a few other people think that not everything should have a price on it and also have a choice to remove the watermark like watch a video to remove it for one time or buy to remove it permanently. So please make it free at least only a few free. It will probably make more people play this game. But apart from that its a pretty good app. Also when i first got the game and it didnt install so i tried for a whole hour then it finally worked. Please fixed this.', 'I LOVE THIS SO MUCH!!! The controls are easy, and the layout is simple. Though you do have to pay for more items, you only watch a short ad, which in my opinion is a reasonable price. Characters are highly customizable which really helps me make ocs or showing my friends what they look like. Also there is a Live Portriat Maker for boys as well. Its essentially the same thing, just male characters instead.', ""I would give it a 5 star rating if you fix the slot bugs. My characters don't save properly. For example, I load a character and their hair color is gone. Their hair is just white. And the background is gone as well, as if everything restarted, lastly, my clothes wouldnt be the same from how i made the character in the slot. It's so frustrating and I hate it so much of how disorganized it is. Also, everytime I press a button, the screen freezes for no reason, then I exit back to the character."", 'The only thing i dont like is that ( i dont know if they updated this or not) but they dont have ponytails and they have a separate app for boys and girls. I rhink they should have boys and girls on one app. Please fix this it will save me time.']"

Played it on a phone and must say, this is pretty hard to keep the overview, as there are many interface elements. Although the game makes a pretty good job regarding the user interface, it might be better to play on a tablet.', ""Be rich or don't play. It has everything is needs to be a successful game. However; players will leave it within a year. This game has zero to do with skill and 100% about how much money you spend. I've spent $70 on this game and I am still at a huge gap. Point is, it's hardcore pay 2 win. You can not keep up with someone dropping cash all the time. Could had been a great game that would have been around a long time. But they always go p2w in the end."", ""BDM is a great game with lots of potential. I would add a mode to replay the story line over again on a harder setting. I would put a time limit on people who get killed excessively in nightmare mode where they can't be killed or kill other players for 5 minutes after dying like 3 times in a row. That way guilds can't bully people out of experiencing the full potential of the game. Another thing I would add is a monthly subscription feature for those that can't afford to spend a lot of money."", ""Great game at the beginning but the pay Gap is just to large. The pay wall isn't just a small advantage, you will get one shot. There is no way to out skill it, it's just one shot. To those that say it is pay for convenients. You buy pearls then convert them to purple currency and buy accessories on the market. That is the very definition of pay to win. Great game ruined by pure p2w"", ""Black Desert Mobile is literally everything it set out to be. It is a true, FULL MMORPG experience on a mobile device. And the premium look of a current gen game to boot. There is no pay to win here. Everything is worthy of the grind time put into it and speaking of that: THERE'S SO MUCH TO DO. From main quests to side quests and even to life skills grinding; you won't get bored. I literally decided to play BDO Mobile over the PC version because of how clean and well made this port is!"", ""Update: Still deserves a 5 star rating. Graphics and customization are outstanding, and it's on the top among other mobile mmorpg. Progress is free to play friendly as the items can be crafted in your camp which is great and that gives BDM a huge difference among other mmorpg. You can completely ignore pvp and still experience the game to it's peak. Only downside I see is the 1v1 arena, it's just too big range players can just run around and win against melee players. Overall, a very great game."", 'I hope that you add an option to go to my friend directly if he uses the same server / and when we enter a battle against a monster that allows members to gather in one place before starting the battle / and that you add an option to narrate the characteristics of a friend like any weapon used and any armor because he is my friend, of course he will not Mind that / and (Adding an option to modify the color of weapons and armor) This is all I have, I hope it helps you improve the game. ☺️', ""Love this game but arena and ramoness are too unfair. REMOVE CP INFLUENCE IN ARENA AND/OR RAMONESS. Giants dominate in the arena. not sure if it's a glitch but even if you're far, giants can grab you, plus they have high damage + defense. and sometimes you get paired up with someone with a higher CP. A CP diff of 100 makes a huge difference in stats. Even with ramoness! A few hits from the enemy and we're dead, we barely get to retaliate."", ""This is a very in-depth and thoroughly developed game. The pay2win format and microtransactions exist which is in itself a HUGE detriment for the online gaming experience. During maintenance periods, there are GM's who have a live discussion of upcoming changes and I think that's a very good thing. My reasoning for 3 stars instead of 5 is that Pearl Abyss not only refuses, but is exacerbating an absolutely HORRIBLE camera system. It's constantly spoken of and only seems to get worse with time."", 'A game where players can opt to either put the game on auto or compete with their wallets.

You can watch your supermodel character auto fight with beautiful and flashy combat. Heavily pay to win thou. You can pay for items, like shards, that increases your power directly. EVERYTHING, especially, paided item here is RNG too. Meaning the items you paid for goes into another RNG system where you either get nothing good or something barely good. Everything in this game is designed to make you addicted.', ""After playing for 3 months I can't recommend the game in its current state. It's just there to milk whales and you can't progress without relying on RNG. After 70k coins at the gambling shop I didn't receive anything worthwhile. Rates are hidden and every update introduces more and more content for whales or tries to bait you into spending with new packs. Horrible adaptation of the KR version. Don't download."", ""Overall appealing graphically, fun combat, addictive reward system. Main issue lies in the amount of grinding required in the higher levels. Gear determines overall how strong you are going to get aside from the passive buff gained from the dark spirit and it's level. You could dump real money into the game to get a little faster leveling, but with the rates for upgrades and drops for the upgrade materials/weps you could find yourself overspending. Otherwise expect long long times to Max level"", 'Terrible p2w microtransactions are a theme with this game. With that said this is probably the most competent phone mmo out there, and miles batter than any other I have tried in terms of actual gameplay. This is not a full port of the pc game though, and uses a ffxiv esq zone system with loading screens in between, which can suck in some situations. This also lacks many of the ui features from the pc game, and certain systems appear to be left out entirely.', ""Would've been 5 stars but its a p2w game. Considering I've been playing since first day of launch in december, I've put 10-12 hours daily into this game and there is 0 reward system for those who dedicate a lot of their time. Favouring p2w players and the fact that they won't reveal the RNG drop system for example shakatu or character loot in open world like they do on Korean version of the game, it just goes to say how this company is trying to milk players of their funds. Won't last too long."", ""Very fun. Can get a little repetitive, but still a great time killer. My only gripe, and the reason for 4 not 5 stars, is the prices of in game items is on the pricey side. It's easy to play for free and get decent gear. Nothing too crazy is locked behind a paywall. My other concern is PvP matchmaking. In arena battles you will either get paired with someone who will kill you in a couple hits, or someone you can kill in a couple hits. Also, the 3v3 arena matchmaking is even worse."", ""This game is insultingly P2W. The drop rates of items to upgrade your character are abysmal. But dont fret, for REAL MONEY you can buy all your upgrades in the cash shop. Almost all are not for sale in the market place, so if you're a F2P player dont expect to be able to buy these from P2W players. If your not prepared to drop 2500-5000 USD then find another game."", ""I love the update. The features and all. Though the game is moving rather too fast making it feels like the map is somewhat small, it's because it's moving to fast. Since there's a horse, it would better for moving in foot to be slower so we will have the rich experience to stroll. And it would be lovely to have 3rd person view from the shoulder."", ""This game is the best rpg game I ever played in mobile. I just wish when you are reading something after your quests completed those dialog. Monster wont attack. I wish there are less monsters too many of them. You can even go somewhere to sit and take a rest and I wish it's an auto hp recovery little by little. Otherwise nice graphics superb game ever"", ""Definitely worth the wait! Every system in the game has been impressively optimized. This is easily the BEST MMO experience you'll find on a mobile device. Ignore the complaints about graphics. No other MMORPG on Google Play comes close to looking this good. Okay... maybe Honkai Impact 3rd 😉 Update: 2/18/2020 The drop rates on mystical (orange) gear are extremely low. Spending Shakatu coins or grinding feels pointless for F2P. Also the RNG mechanics are just soul crushing 😩"", ""Fun game for a while. Once you've played for a few days you quickly learn all drops are so rare it sucks the fun out of it. The devs are so greedy they falsely claim drop rates are increased yet in reality they are lower than before. They've now introduced the ability to craft orange gear if you burn three other orange pieces to craft it which makes no sense whatsoever. They also removed self healing from sorceress to get you to spend more on potions. Not worth the time unless you are a whale"", ""Not really an MMORPG, more of a hack and slash game. I was looking for a game that I can play with my girlfriend similar to WOW, we downloaded it because it looks good and it's really fun, but after we beat the tutorials we found out we can't join the same party in this game (only in some raid thing). This game is super fun and would otherwise be perfect if we could quest together in the open world like a real MMORPG. So a bit of false advertising on the developer's part :("", 'PA made this game waaay too RNG heavy in order to force people to buy their way through to keep up with people. Progression us near impossible without money. Fishing has no use and fish are worth close to nothing unlike the pc/console versions. Cooking is non-existant. Overall 3 stars unless they improve RNG greatly and make some changes to fishing and give us the ability to cook foods with buffs like other versions. Edit: P2W just keeps getting worse. no longer worthy of any stars', ""Far less confusing than the PC version, since they removed a lot of things it had, that also had very little instruction or none at all. You get a singular camp as opposed to buying houses around the land; personally a minus for me, I like decorating my home. Even on low graphics, looks good on my phone. I don't rate lower bc I like this game; I'd rate lower bc no way to get premium pearls, and a lot of stuff use that for currency. Lack of free cosmetics. Costumes with stats are also big no."", ""Looks nice, plays awful. 4k CP Warrior. Let's start with weight limit. I shouldnt have too go sell at the store every 45 minutes for an afk mmo. I shouldn't be able to carry more than my horse. It is impossible to play this game manually with the way the screen zooms in x50 every time you use a skill. It is the most obnoxious screen I have ever seen in a decade of playing mobile games. Targeting is a JOKE. Classes unbalanced. Bad gameplay. Graphics are great but that's not enough to redeem."", ""Nice graphics. Perfect for casual players. Only reason why it's not 5 star is because of some pay2win contents, as f2p players will get capped at certain level. If you're not looking to compete with the top 2-3% of the players, this game is great. Developers are also taking note of players comments/complain, which I feel it's a huge plus (at least players dont feel neglected). Weekly events are also pretty generous to f2p players."", 'I never played Dlack Desert Online, so this was my first game in the series. Action RPG with pretty much top notch graphics as far as a phone is concerned. Game looks and sounds great, and character moves look good and are generally satisfying. My biggest gripe is that I dislike the control scheme in games like this, but I enjoyed this one enough to force myself to adapt to it, and overall I would say the effort was worth it for the experience. Time will tell if end game is enjoyable.', 'A large step forward in mobile rpgs. The graphics are at least somewhat comparable to the desktop and console versions of the game, just stunning. While the zones are much smaller, and not completely open, the movement and combat is 360 degrees, as opposed to those games based on an isometric viewpoint where you can only move in 4 directions. There is busy-work, as there is in most rpgs, but this game is much more convenient than the desktop and console versions of the game, allowing good progress to be made while afk or even with the game closed. While logged in, there is plenty to do, with both instanced and world boss fights, a decent quest-line, individual a 3 person team pvp, as well as the choice to flag in common world content. As far as content, the only frustrating point I find is there are 2 designated pvp zones that are completely dominated by the strongest guild on the server, and so basically not accessible to anyone not in the guild. You enter the zone, you get killed. Overall, there is no other mobile rpg game I\'ve played that comes close to giving an immersive and \'realistic\' experience as this game does. \'Realistic\' in a fantasy sense. It also seems this game is set up to grow as the hardware gets better, as they\'ve already added a great deal of content since launch. I\'d give this 4 1/2 stars as it isn\'t perfect, but it is better than ""I liked it"", so I gave it 5 stars.', ""The only negative I have is the PvP. A 50-CP difference often leads to a one-sided match - it's boring if you're stronger and unpleasant if you're weaker. It's just not fun and having events based on it makes it worse. Edit: Actually, the matchmaking in general is bad. There's either a huge difference in level or CP. It also doesn't create a phantom after 30 seconds like it says it does."", ""Major Issues Need To Address!!! 1) Arena (1vs1) - Gotta fix this!! As everyone who loves to pvp and having equal gear makes people want to play more on arena. It's all about the skills, but instead it varies by gears. Every pvp players seems to want this espicially, low cp people. 2) Nightmare Zone - Another huge issue here!!! Richer will get richer/cp boost. Dominated guild will overtake everything and theirs no limit. Please change this like how it is with pc BD. Make it fun for all"", ""Fair enough to f2p and p2w, most game contents can be experienced. Nightmare mode is certainly an appreciation zone for those p2w. Outmatched CP in PvP can be managed if one is skilled. Development does it right for a long run where players can get done 100% main quests and 95% of sidequests within 2 months, another 5% left for endgame grinding. Droprates are really upsetting but it's a semi idle game after all,whats the point if everyone has Redgears? Node war, siege war and ramosas are of cour"", ""At some point you will find yourself looking at content that ask for your 20 to 100 buck's. Cash grab. It may have good graphics, but game is centered all around its many currencies and tricks to tempt and boost yourself with your credit card. I tried buying once something and I figured even 1000s of us dollars won't make you any good. If you want to be competitive, Uninstaller this piece of #### now."", ""Thus far I have enjoyed the game. There are alot of moving pieces with gameplay, guild events, camp, boss battles, farming, black spirit, and the list goes on.there are some things that could be improved on such as arena, adventure fame, etc.That being said. This game takes up alot of space, so if you have 5 free gigs of memory and a minimum of 5 GB of ram and like the adventure fantasy style then I'd say invest the time. Also this game is extremely f2p friendly."", ""This game has lots of replay value. The quests are easy to find and the AI does a good job on auto-attack mode. It's an overall decent game compared to others of the same type. Still disappointed to find so many games not accommodate inverted y axis. Will play through as much as possible. Also, being limited to two friends seems pointless."", ""If you're looking for a game that has more to it than your normal MMO RPG than this is the game. Tones of different areas to explore and a load of enhancements to make. You have the choice to pay to advance or not; in this game it really isn't necessary to buy your advancement. Everything about it is worth while and you get what you pay for. Very good game."", ""Best mobile game of 2020! Finally, a great game that's NOT a cash grab! When you really enjoy a game without feeling pressured to spent cash, eventually you WANT to spend money, and when you get a lot of value or your cash that makes you want to spend more. Few mobile developers understand this. At least these guys understand half of that, reduce your prices guys. AND PLEASE FIX THE BUG ALLOWING PEOPLE TO SELL BLUE ITEMS ON THE MARKET BELOW MINIMUM VALUE! I CAN'T SELL STUFF NOW."", ""Awesome game, I love how the game can be set on auto, i play while I'm at work and cant be on all the time. Some cons are the drop rates and randomness of everything..getting awesome stuff without paying with money can be tedious. Over all i find this to be one of the best free to play games on mobile..I am anxious for new additions to the game with future updates"", 'Extreme and grotesque levels of p2w here. Ignore that and it\'s probably the best mobile game there is of this kind. Be prepared to drop thousands if you want to be a wannabe pvp God ""like everyone else in line"". Rest of game is fine and enjoyable. The afk features are nice although some dont seem to understand it. Or its uses. Will give 5 stars when ninja releases. Most likely.']"

Great game, but I do have some suggestions. I think you should double length of the runways and and create more space on the island. Also, If you can, can you add a breaking system and flaps and other controls? That would make the game much more realistic. Also increase the size of the aircraft carrier so bigger aircraft can operate there. And the causes of crashes are unreasonable. We shouldn't crash just because. Please fix this!"", 'Pretty good. Easy to learn', ""Love it, seriously yo! That said, it's time for you guys to create some new levels. I've been waiting for like forever yo.

I'm flying a Leer jet and a 747 but I'm not allowed have a glider???"", 'This game is completely annoying. The physics and flying mechanics are complete rubbish and make no sense. For some strange reason, all airports on land are elevated from the ground. And most of the planes cost real life money, and way overpriced. The adds are horrendously frequent and long, often without a skip button and is a video you have to watch. All this game does is make money for the dev. Not worth playing. Definitely not a real flight simulator.', 'Well put together game. Graphics are not the best, but are plenty for the game scenario. Many great planes available, and alot of levels!

How about some upgrades??? Target practice? Air combat? Having fun killing ballons with a Stealth, but... :)', 'So, heres my thoughts! I really dig this game, but now its time you develope another level? Like how about we go across the ocean and ya have to land on an aircraft carrier for fuel! You only get one chance to land or you run out a fuel. But if you can get fuel, than off to japan you go, huge sky scrapers light up, real cool view, but now you have to land at the airport and because of only being the only port to land at its very busy, so you may have to circle around a few times lol. I rite code', ""Love the game, only one problem, the last level is not out , and I don't think it's ever going to be out, but if it does come out, the developers should add some more planes like Concorde or the A380. Otherwise I really recommend the game to anyone who wants to be entertained for hours. The ads are short and most often, you can skip them . If you're getting overloaded by ads, just turn of your internet."", 'Concept is great but they ruined it with the ads and this gold digger algorithm. From time to time you get discounts on expensive planes that you ""surprisingly"" cannot afford tripping many players into buying coins.

Other than that, I've had zero problems with this game, and I really enjoy playing it"", ""Really fun to fly around but the controls are atrocious. Also, I am kinda dissapointed in the planes you can buy with real money, there are loads of them and they don't differ at all from the in games ones (except for the paint job) you sh/could bring some more variety in those. Please just... Fix that, if you care about your players. Thank you"", ""Too many ads. Like, an obscene amount of long, unskippable ads. I get it, it's free. But, there is ad after ad after ad.

This game is not realistic, the cockpit looks like someone (like my friend) made it (badly). The checkpoints are circles lying flat on the ground when they can be in the sky as rectangles or circles facing the player. In conclusion, these creators are prejudices for their game."", 'Game not really fun. There is only one control choice and the game developers decided to make me control the plane with tilt.

It throws you right into the main quest without giving any idea of what the plot of the game is, and the gameplay isn\'t intuitive for someone playing it for the first time at all. I also didn\'t really like the gameplay itself. And to add insult to injury, despite picking a female character, I got referred to as ""he"".', 'The game is a nostalgic tumble into the past. I spent too many of my teenage hours playing the PC version of RO so when this game was released, I immediately decided to try it out. There are pros and cons to this mobile version. The game can be glitchy, the translations are off oftentimes and the game is very heavily geared towards those who can pay more to win. I still enjoy the game enough and have been able to befriend some good people so overall, the game has still been worth playing.', ""-UPDATE 27/01- The devs, for some reason, tried to fix what was not broken. They reduced the WOC/WOE PVP time, making the game mostly PVE. Then, they reduced the amount of times we could join an instance (we didn't get any additional rewards by entering more than one time. we just did it to help our guildmates) Right now, it is harder for a F2P player to catch up due to these changes."", ""ROM is clearly dying and devs don't care how each update is unpolished. Thus, the devs focus has turned this game into a mindless cash grab aimed at loyal fans as a form of monthly/fantasy gachas. What upsets me is with all the money they make, there are still many bugs in the latest update, episode 6. The game is still F2P though. Many new players will have to grind alot to catch up to the rest of the players. This maybe a turnoff for some."", ""It was good and reminiscent until I found out the truth... After lvl 40 job change or so, I realize that theres a friggen limit cap on leveling. And the game is a grind fest in itself which I have no complaints. But when you limit the grinding time, at least let it recover somehow instead of wait 5 am every morning. Ok. So now you are forcing us to play the game fine it's fun and all but after 130 minutes I cant even enjoy grinding anymore.

This game constantly crashes on the IPAD - it's actually gotten worse with each new episode release. I literally crash - meaning the game completely shuts down as if I never logged in - on average 20 times per play session. Others in my guild on IPads are having the same problem. When will this ever be addressed? It's so bad now that I'm not sure I even want to keep playing the game and I'm about to demand some refunds for my subscription fees. If you say it will work on iOS then is should WORK consistently - it never crashes on my second account which I play using my android phone. Come on Gravity - fix known bugs already. Additionally, this month (Feb 2020) I have applied my subscription to my IPad account and it's acting as if I have not used the ticket. I cannot use more than 7 chains, teleports you get with premium are missing, etc. You guys are about to lose a user with 2 premium accounts, not to mention the other purchases I make!"", ""I'm a very big fan of the original game and love that they brought it back mobile. Reducing combat time generation to 150/day and max 450 is a disservice to the players. You've done a great job of making the game less enticing to botters and creating a shop to replace the possibility. It also creates a better income. Great job. Return combat time to 300 and max 900 and make premium item account wide and I'll give 5 stars. I just want to be able to play the game, seriously 2 hours of play a day."", ""Started playing as I reminisced about the PC version until players had to start paying.

The translation is hard to understand, low quality and sometimes nonsense. That needs to be fixed."", ""This is it for me, I had to quit. The latest update episode 6 they added a bunch of new runes that power up your character. The only way to get S tier runes is by spending real cash or combining class A runes. Here's the catch, the S runes you buy with real cash wont even be guaranteed to be a skill for your class, actually 90% chance it wont. You will need to buy 5 at a time (about 15$) in order to get ONE FOR YOUR CLASS. Then it still might be a bad skill.... LUDACRIS."", ""Game is ok just takes time to get anything which is fine. Ironically enough, I know the old game didn't have skin color options and nobody cared and neither did I but it was such a long time ago that I'm so used to being able to pick a skin color other than white at this point considering that I, myself, am not white. I feel like adding the option would be a nice touch. Already have a trans option. Might as well give a skin color option too."", ""I want to give a 5 star for this because i play since primary school. I give 3 star because maybe got some issue when playing. Problem is when i leveling, monster same level with my character only got 20 base and 14 job. So i think maybe need to attack higher level then my character. It takes me have to use potion and mana until the monster die and still the same got 20 base and 14 job. Really disappointed and really feel like didn't want play anymore. Please fix it. Thanks"", ""As a former iRO player. This is a nice update! Many complain of pay walls, which is true, but the game offers plenty of free to play aspects that need patience to obtain. Real money only boosts how fast you obtain items, gold medals, etc. To sum up this game: auto/manual play, looter, boss hunting, PvP, PvE, GvG, forge/crafting. The game takes time, you can't enjoy it if your impatient! 3rd class alone will take you a few months and to obtain the proper gear will take at least a year or longer."", 'After 6.0 came out the GM fixed a lot of proplems.

Characters mysteriously vanishing without a trace, unexplained crashes in battles (right after you start, taking the clan boss key) and no answers to support tickets. The Discord forums have all been changed to have insanely long slowmodes (30 minutes in #bug-reports). I played this game for a year, but I'm done. Problems happen, it's how a company deals with them that tells you everything you need to know."", ""The game went from great to trash overnight. With the latest patch that was just released on 2/12/20, the game just kept crashing, bugs/glitches all over, and they just implemented everything for mainly heavy spender. We can see what audience they are targetting. If you dont have the expense I suggest not to start. I have made my decision to quit and I think it's the best thing moving forward. It's a gotcha type game and they dont care for their consumer needs. New players be warned.."", 'Unfortunately this is one of those ""Amazing Potential"" gatcha games mired in it\'s own problems. While the game play itself is pretty solid, they haven\'t put out anything new since September. We\'ve gone almost 6th months and the only thing they have put out as ""Content"" is a battle pass, and numerous balances. Nothing new for players to do as a whole. I really do like the art direction and general game play, but over all it\'s becoming more and more apparent they either aren\'t giving their dev team enough support to put things out, or just don\'t care because the spenders are indeed keeping them afloat at the moment.', ""The game itself is excellent. Graphics are beautiful and the gameplay is relatively friendly to low-spenders. On the other hand, I've been disconnected due to server issues every day in the last week. Further, the company itself is horrible. They lie about events, make unfair changes to certain player's accounts, and generally ignore community feedback. Do yourself a favor and check out the forums before giving them any of your money."", ""Game was awesome! New battle pass is terrible. Blatant pay to win now. Extreme disadvantage for free players. Would spend a little here and there before, won't spend another penny now. Not even subtle costs.... $40 a month. clash of clans did the same thing but it only cost $5 a month.

The compensation for these losses is hardly a fraction of what was lost. Personally, I would not recommend this.', ""Game is becoming exceedingly pay to win. The new battle pass is a joke. You have to pay $25 to get two of the 3 features it has. Did I mention it comes with 25 free levels? Also gold members don't receive the benefits for free which seems money thirsty by the company. It seems now that the game is getting popular, it's going to turn into a pay to win microtransaction money grabbing scheme. If it wasn't for these reasons, the game is great, hence my 3 star rating. Sad to see it go this direction."", ""This game is fun to play, I won't deny that at all. All in all it has great content but the greed is way too real. The new battle pass is a disgrace to battle passes. I've never heard of a battle pass that 1. Cost more than $10 and 2. Has to be bought with real money instead of in game currency.

If you complete every daily challenge every day you still can't reach max level rewards in enough time without having to buy level boosts in Battle Pass.

This latest patch introduced peanuts of game play and it's taken them hours after it going live to make the game stable."", ""If you like bugs, server maintenance, lack of content and spending a fortune. This is the game for you. The CMs lie, the game does not go 1 day without several server reboots and everything is monetized. If you're thinking about trying to play this game F2P, don't bother. There are zero events that can be completed by a F2P player without months of planning. Developers tease patches, fixes and new content that takes months to arrive or just doesn't arrive at all."", ""I feel there's one major con above everything. Yes it's our choice to make a purchase or not. Yes there are new people and content all the time... But seriously, every single time I open the game I spend almost 2minutes clearing out the ads and popups that I'm not wanting. It's every time the game opens up, whether a few minutes or half a day. The rates also I'm hoping can be more adequate because drops and summons are starting to be a joke and waste of time. As well as the artifact upgrades...""]"

You don't need to spend money to get a JRPG experience, although I did end up getting some currency to support the devs. Plenty of free gacha rolls for new party members. Controls are smooth once you get used to them, battle system is easy to learn yet hard to master. There are some very minor graphical glitches that can be distracting to look at but don't effect gameplay."", ""Probably the best mobile rpg. This feels like a full console rpg and not like a gacha. The music, graphics, story, characters are all top notch. There is a gacha, but you don't need to use it. You can play through the entire game with the free characters you get. I hope most mobile games take a page from Another Eden and this becomes the new standard. Thanks Devs for making such an awesome experience."", ""Another Eden is the type of game that no matter how old you get, it brings you back to the heart of RPGs. Storyline sucks you in. Keeps you wondering what is next. The battle system is easy to use and navigate. The graphics and dialogue make you feel like you should of bought this game, but yet it's free! And best of all, it's an RNG game so it just gives you the element of surprise and suspense everytime you unlock a new character! I'm only about 5 hours in, and I am extremely satisfied!"", ""If you have trouble downloading or updating try clearing cache and restarting device, then put device near router. Always works for me and the game is totally worth it. I also see people complain about grinding but it gives you something to do if you're waiting on new content and there's no time limit on anything except banners. No need to rush. All rpgs have grinds. Take your time and enjoy the story. Thank you devs for such an awesome, high quality, free game"", ""Great game it is one of the best in its genre!!! It needs some options tho, in my opinion you need to be able to sell the gears that you don't want anymore in the game, also as a single player game it would be great to be able to play the game with one account in multiple devices so I can save some battery for my phones daily use, the final issue I had with the game is how it downloads the entire game data for every update, nearly 4GB is a lot for a mobile game"", ""Just one complaint: Why do you guys make it so hard to do data transfers? I literally had to download the entire dataTWICE to do ONE transfer. It's annoying and time-consuming. Just allow us to tap on the help screen and transfer our data BEFORE downloading everything. Is it that hard to do that, because, that's how Memoria Freese works, how can't it work here?"", ""I'm still early on into the game but the graphics and voice acting are nice and the story seems interesting thus far. Although right now it seems all over the place, I'm waiting to see how or if everything will connect. I wish there were ways to skip through some of the dialogue and that there wasn't a 3 second delay every time you accept a quest. For a game with such nice graphics and art, the skills and abilities are visually lacklustre. The kids playing DM6 had nicer looking Flame tornadoes."", 'Really good game experience, very easy to understand and to learn but is not one of those games that you get bored of 3 days after. Regarding the music, this game has one of the best OST that I have ever heard. To put it in a nutshell, I will encourage everyone to try this game, either you are an experienced RPG player or you just started playing RPG, you are gonna fall in love with it!', ""An old school RPG with a modern day twist that'll satisfy all JRPG fans. Yes, it has gachas elements, but there's absolutely no paywall to keep you from enjoying this beautiful single player experience. The combat and gameplay are simple and satisfying, so you'll never feel the need to find a guide to trudge along for the best experience, just play how you want! Sit back and enjoy in small burst or long sessions. This is in my opinion the gold standard for single player mobile RPGs."", ""The gameplay is very fun and can bring a proper challenge, the story and Characters are very likable, not the best story but it is enough to get the player be invested to the story. The game is very time consuming, such as every JRPG and there isn't a time where the player won't have anything to do because of the sheer amount of content that is in this game."", ""In terms of gameplay Most games like this start out fun, too bad the dialogue is painful and unskipable, like usual there's no real depth, no progression, no options, everything is diminishing returns, its more Grindy as you go, you don't progress in your earnings, every summon has less value than the last, every act becomes monotonous, leveling slows down, combat wasn't very good in the first place - now it's a chore, now everything's a chore, and the game sours..."", ""One of the great ftp rpg's on mobile. No play limits like energy. A lot like the chrono family of games."", ""Here I thought this was just going to be another generic gacha game, but man I was wrong. This game truly exceeded my expectations and I'm honestly shocked at how much effort went into this game, with it being a mobile game and all. The game itself is amazing! It's got a pretty interesting story, great graphics and animations, and it's got great music also. Definitely recommend you give this game a shot if you're a fan of Final Fantasy or JRPGs. Even if you aren't I'd still say give it a chance"", ""Sadly after having to uninstall temporarily, re- installing and downloading the app does not work for me. It says I do not have a stable wifi. However I do. My phone is not old either. (Galaxy s10e, btw). I think I missed the whole P5 collab because of it. I'm going to have to uninstall and just forget the game. I liked it when I first played. Oh well."", ""Honestly this game deserves 5 stars. The one grief I have is with new updates which are nice the download speed even on a good connection with high speed takes FOREVER! Be warned you'll have to leave your phone open and downloading for close to an hour the first time and then about 25-30 minutes for each update. That's the only real problem I have with the game though. It really is a ton of fun"", 'This game never fully downloads it says i have a network error when i dont my internet is great i missed out om 4 events especially the persona 5 event. Fix this!', 'Uuh, i lost my phone a few months ago, now i wanted to play this game again with my new device, but i cant start the game, it says ""save data compatibility check failed(UH)"". Help please? I love this game', ""So far the gameplay has been very good as well as the art style and the soundtrack. The only thing I can complain about was the download which was interrupted and restarted a couple of times from 0. I will update my review once I will get further into the game/story but so far I'm quite happy with this game plus I'd doesn't have so many annoying microtransactions like many other mobile games/whale hunters."", ""Possibly the best jrpg on mobile. It's a full on rpg, with great story, writing and no freaking stamina system. Doesn't feel pay to win and the art style is nice. I came to play because it's from developers of Chrono Trigger, but stayed because it's just a great rpg on mobile, which is great or non existent on this platform. Try it out and form your own opinion."", ""This is honestly my favorite mobile game. Gameplay, art, and story are honestly perfect; it almost made me want to pay the microtransactions (and I am f2p only player!). The only reason why I don't invest money in this game is because of how expensive it is. Each gacha roll costs about 4 USD, and the rates for getting a 5 star character are one of the lowest I've ever seen for a gacha game. From past experiences I usually roll the 10x banner 5 times to get a 5 star. That's $200 USD or more.""]"

I hate the need to constantly download content. I can't continue with the chapters without having to download anywhere between 50-300MB that adds on. Not everyone has unlimited storage, a pain to have to do consistent, and you can't play without WiFi. Without that game would be better.. a lot better"", ""Any RPG fan will love this. Great soundtrack, the story seems solid although I'm not far into the game. The mechanics work well, and the characters are really well done. Small touches like giving every character or dragon you summon their own little story when viewing them is what sets this game apart. Seems like a lot of work went into making this unique and not another reskin of all the games currently on the app store. Overall, great story, soundtrack, and gameplay. Cant complain bout that"", ""I love this game. There are a ton of great characters to collect, and the game is very giving to F2P players. Assembling strategic teams and leveling them up is fun. The gameplay is great. There are a ton of different things to do. You can play a lot of content real time with other players. You can autoplay when just grinding for things or turn the autoplay off for more challenging stuff. The story is great. There are updates for special events. It's an all around great game."", 'I enjoy the gameplay, but the sheer amount of money required to get non-guaranteed, one-time-only-ever crossover heroes/dragons when you keep getting ""featured"" regular-pool heroes/dragons instead has almost completely turned me off of this game. Getting crossover units in the past was not this BS way, and on top of this they split the crossover units into multiple banners, with both banners having those regular-pool ""featured"" units to destroy your odds of getting the crossovers. Awful change.', 'The 3d model are black. The game runs well, but the characters and some of the other details are just black figures. The ""team"" page for example is mostly black in the middle. Is my tablet just not strong enough? Do other people have the same problem? I tried messing with the settings and nothing happened. *Update* I bought a better phone and the game runs perfectly. Also figured out the ebb and flow of character progression. Great game; love the MH update.', ""Beautiful and well polished game, Grundy but fun. Menu animations are a tad slow, which menus were faster especially since there are a lot with lots of stuff to do. File size is immense and even on the lowest graphical settings, my Samsung Galaxy S7 struggles from time to time causing it to overheat too. Hope they add the option to have reduced quality textures and even lower polygon count so my phone doesn't die."", ""A game that would have been better served as a full release on the Nintendo Switch instead of a mobile cash grab. Lots of potential for RPG elements to be endearing. The desire to invest time and resources into characters and dragons is real, but the wonky power requirements for missions don't make sense. So much potential had Nintendo decided to make a fully fleshed story instead of a F2P campaign with microtransactions to get the full experience."", ""I love this game! I love how generous Cygames is and I love the designs of everything! The main story could be written better though... Also I don't really like the controls. It got better with the AI getting smart enough to dodge special attacks, most of the time, but it still doesn't feel great to play. This is due mostly to how so many of the commands are rather similar (ie: it can be difficult to get a heavy attack off when I just end up running) and how clunky moving around feels."", 'Outstanding mobile game experience Great polishment on story content, very good soundtrack, eventa really well made(compare with Pokémon Masters events for example), nice unique bosses, the ratio of free to play currency is pretty good(you will get more than 15 5* units a year with that much currency spent on Gala banners). They listen a lot to the community, they game improved tons since day1. Plays great both on Redmi Note 3 and 5. The only very punishing content is endgame content.', ""If you want a game so generous that it gives away the currency needed to summon regularly, once a day free ten pulls, and every unit be usable then chose this game. Plus it helps that events don't require you to dump enough money to fill the Marina Trench to be able to complete certain events like Fire Emblem Heroes, or Puzzles and Dragons."", ""I played this same from launch. It started kind of rough but has seen steady improvements over the past few years. Dragalia Lost is pretty rewarding for F2P players and there always seems to be an event or crossover coming up to keep the game fresh. I'd definitely recommend it!"", 'I have been super impressed with this game ever since it came out. The developers are constantly improving game play and are trying hard to appeal to veteran players and new player alike. I am so glad that the game runs new and original events and crossover events. I am hope they continue to perfect this game and know that their hard work is appreciated.', ""Dragalia Lost is by far Nintendo's biggest and best game on mobile yet. Cygames did an amazing job developing this title. It's menus and UI are very similar to Fire Emblem Heroes, but the gameplay is so much better. The only game I think I'll enjoy as much as this is Mario Kart Tour. (Edit) Mario Kart Tour sucks."", ""Good game with tons of content. Summoning can be quite punishing with no guarantee and being pity-broken by off banner units. If they add some sort of token system that allows us to choose our unit after so many tenfold summons, I'd give this 5 stars. The gameplay has some real depth and most units are viable, but absolutely requires having people to play with if you want to be successful. The game is a bit laggy on my Motorola G6 Play unfortunately, but it's probably just my device."", ""One of the few mobile gatcha games that feels worth it. It's simple Legend of Zelda style gameplay with charming characters and simple but feel good stories. The microtransactions are tucked away rather than in your face like most games, but the risk and reward of this game doesn't feel unbalanced. The dev team constantly rewards players and consistently balances the game as well. If you only play one Gatchapon game, this is the one."", ""I honestly can't praise this game enough, it doesn't get the love it deserves and coming from a guy that plays lots of Gachas I feel confident in calling this game the gold standard of Gachas. Unfortunately it doesn't have the built in fanbase other successful Gachas have, but if you look past that you'll find a balanced game that caters to all players, not just whales, lovable characters and world design, an interesting story, constant updates with a close ear to the community."", ""The interface is appealing and sharply designed. All of the design elements are just terrific. The story and characters are well written and well acted. The controls are simple and intuitive and actions have satisfying feedback. I really enjoy the depth or the upgrade and customization systems. Overall, this is one of the best mobile games I've played. Excellent effort!"", ""I've spent a lot of time playing Dragalia Lost and it's been a top tier experience for the most part. It's got a great hook and will have you coming back for more everyday. It's 'gotcha' mechanics are mostly fair but are too addicting and not always rewarding. I've spent well over $400 trying to summon a single unit and never got her. For this reason, I'm done with Dragalia Lost and hope that players out there will be more responsible with it than I was. I'm done throwing my money away. I'm out."", 'Amazing Game! My only problem is that the storage this game requires is MASSIVE! Tgis is the ONLY game on my device and its prompting my low storage warning. There needs to be some form of update in the future that will minimize the file size at some point. Otherwise the game is awesome and fun to play, honestly im surprised that it took me so long to play this Gem', ""This game used to be fun. It's got some fun mechanics and enjoyable experience but it's very very much pay to win. 10x summons rarely give you useful characters, the event characters included. Plus a 10x summon is $25. That's ridiculously expensive for something that doesn't even guarantee a useful character. Plus the game is very misleading with how strong you have to be to progress, and doesn't teach you how. Very very poor treatment of a great idea of a game."", ""The game itself is fun, the action and mechanics we're good and the music is great! But this game has one of the WORST % for it's Gatcha aspect. When you do 4 of the 10 group pulls (40 pulls) and you get one 4*, card? The rates are absolutely terrible. I got a 5* pull on my first group pull, and never got one again. I think your rates are artificially up if you've just started playing to get you hooked. Other games at least have a rising % or a cap that you'll get it after a certain amount pulled/rates won't go down. This is a terrible gambling game for these rates, and it's why Myself and my husband stopped playing after two weeks."", ""Gameplay is decent, plenty to do for quests (albeit pretty repetitive) and very generous with free stuff but literally the worst when it comes to gacha rates. You can drop hundreds of dollars on a rate up banner and never get a single character that's featured or only get dupe of a character that's not even the featured character. Terrible rates and absolutely horrendous money to game currency ratio. Would suggest keeping low expectations on pulls and play purely as f2p."", ""Came back to try it for the Monster Hunter event. It hands everything to you up front, then tosses a massive wall in front of you with the Dragon Trials, poor design. The crafting system works on the first tier, then doesn't flow/explain how to upgrade weapons and costs way too much to disassemble them in case you messed up trying to figure it out. Leaving again, not coming back anymore, Nintendo you're a joke now."", ""This is my favorite mobile game over FEH, FFBE, and Last Cloudia. The story is a little silly, and people online in endgame content are real jerks about who they will play with, but overall it's a really fun game, not pay to win, and amazing player support from the devs."", ""Great game! I tried it Day 1 but quit for 8 months. QoL is a huge plus for me and being able to auto-repeat stuff is great for grinding and the new revive feature is well done. It lets you redeem yourself after a mess up. I recently did a run of eHMC where i misread my alliance mate's sticker and got us both killed. Once we got up, flawless run rest of the way Finding a good alliance with a Discord or something is essential DL is also super generous with summoning mats and it is the cheapest"", 'Its quite enjoyable. In terms of gameplay it is very similiar to diablo. The dodging can be quite wonky at times, but if you can get use to it, its not to bad. The soundtrack is very nice and gacha rates are relatively high.', ""Jumped on this immediately when I saw a Monster Hunter event and it has been a good time so far. . Controls are a little frustrating on smaller screens but still plenty simple so it almost doesn't matter. Beyond that...probably one of the best free RPG apps I've played!"", ""It's an awesome game, but I cant get into the game pass few days. It goes to the title screen once you hit start its frozen. I have tried uninstalling an reinstalled it. Still doesn't work please come out with a hot fix to fix the problem"", ""Interesting game, I'm enjoying myself a lot but I feel like it's be a lot better if I could use both my hands. Just using my right hand is tiring. Overall enjoying my start of the game so far, unlike other gachas the rates aren't terrible ."", ""Love it, the collabs have really pushed me to come back and show how much this game is truly the dominate gacha game I've ever played. Albeit it isnt perfect, but the things it does well, it does it superbly."", ""Dragalia Lost has a horrible expensive cost for pulling units, and with the lack of any safety net system you can see the horror stories of casual players losing $800+ chasing the current meta. It's a fun game, but a very dangerous gamble for staying on top of the meta for end game content."", ""Great game that's super generous with currency and free pull tickets. One of the better games story-wise in terms of gacha. F2P friendly, especially in events, but can be grind-y at times. Love that they're doing crossovers now. Overall really fun!"", 'Better to start with rerolling, but lots of fun and SO GENEROUS with in game currency! Was my initial experience, however recently they have been a little predatory. For example they recently started splitting banners (which by itself is pretty crummy), and delaying the better half so you waste your saved resources on the first.', ""Early impressions of this game: great art work and animation's, engaging story, the english dubs foe voice are nice, characters a unique enough to encourage diversity. The real money options seem pricey, have done thay yet. Will update this as i play more."", 'The reason why I am rating this as a one star is because I can\'t play on mobile devices like my iPad or Samsung phone meaning I have to play it on a computer but I for one don\'t have a computer. Therefore please fix this glitch because when ever I join dragalia lost it says ""authentication failed due to a network issue"" but I can go on youtube and my other apps that requires internet connection. So my internet is working but I can\'t play.', ""Best gacha I've ever played, hands down. If you play the game like a casual multiplayer game, you'll have a great time. Devs are receptive to feedback and always implementing updates and QoL. You will be treated like a player, not a money bag."", 'Fun game with surprisingly good writing, gacha rates are gacha rates nothing changes there. The soundtrack is addictive and they seem to actually listen to feedback which is nice, Qol improvements are added for free, and game only seems to get better.', 'They have fixed a lot of the bad things they had at the begining and are woking on ways to make the end game content slightly more accessible for everyone. Cards are out of the summon pool which is finally a great change. Many trap banners before events so watch out.', 'Good game, but the only annoying thing is that the summoning aspect leaves a bad taste in my mouth without a guarantee/sparking system, and people can spend $1000 without getting what they want. Also add Magisa', ""I would give higher, but the RNG in this game is absolutely ridiculous. Only found out about this game through it's connection with Monster Hunter, and after approximately 150 summons, still no Hunter Berserker. With the event ending tomorrow, I'll never get one now, which is a massive disappointment tbh.""]"

They focus on events which you have to pay a lot of money for in order to have enough energy to play, or you can pay massive amounts of money for the event awards. In app purchases cost too much. New characters are lazy recolours or reskins of existing ones. Often new characters use old characters animations. Disgrace to the Maiden brand. Do not bother."", 'Always been a fan of Iron maiden. So far the game has not been living up to the band. It had crashed at several moments. Worst being the damn gauntlet. Where I loose the use of my players. It seems they are happy to collect money. But not willing to address the elephant they have. Called connectivity issues, which end up screwing players out of the use of characters. Like i previously mentioned. Thus causing you to have to wait. Until you can get back into the gaunlet.', ""This game went from good to bad in a matter of a month. The difficulty spikes are insane, the pay to win gets more and more shoved into your face as you realize the game is so incredibly difficult that you'll need to farm for good characters and talismans, some battles are outright impossible without the right play. The arena is full of enemies much higher than you and theres nothing you can do about it. Game needs a serious rework in its difficulty"", ""Great music, fantastic graphics and art, and an absorbing storyline. Obviously lot went into this game; it's not just another ad server. The only downside is that it seems it would take a lot of time to learn and play competitively. Unfortunately I don't want to make that kind of commitment right now. But I wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone who wants a fun, engrossing challenge!"", ""I have been playing for a good bit, not too too long but even then I notice some things that arent too well done with this game. The game has a hard halting point near the end of the underworld and even if you manage to scrape through or even do just fine with it, youre stopped again with a huge difficulty spike at night city. Along with that the objectives on some of the skulls quests are ridiculous like 100% health by the end when there's enemies that die upon hit."", ""I love the characters and the background music, etc... Pretty much everything about the game. But the loading time just to play it kills the fun for me. Waiting time is ten minutes for the game to load up (on a good day), and by that time I can't be brothered playing it anymore. Fix this issue and I'll play it again, until then, I'm uninstalling."", ""Game has a fun and interesting concept and very nice artwork. I like that some degree of strategy is needed for progress too. But it has a lot of issues. UI in some areas is terrible and bugs make it hard to enjoy the PvP part of the game. Also, frequent connection errors and server crashes can drive anyone mad. All in all, it would be a great game if bugs and servers got sorted out. In this current state there's a lot of wasted potential."", 'In the spirit of things I would like to say this game is totally RAD! ;) Truly fantastic design and gameplay! The artwork is brilliant and has that classic Maiden feel. Really brings you back. Very generous with rewards and providing what you need to have a fun experience playing without having to spend any money. Tons of creatively designed characters to play, ways to customize and upgrade. Fun PVP battles and challenges. Thank you so much for such a great game!', '""You can fully enjoy the game without ever spending a penny!"" What a bunch of BS now. They have made it nearly impossible to win arena battles and dungeons while playing for free. I\'ve worked so hard developing my characters and it seems like it\'s been all for nothing because I just can win anything anymore. And they charge so much on power up packs and all the extras you need now. It\'s clearly turned into a pay to win and that really bums me out. I used to absolutely adore this game.', ""I grew up listening to Iron Maiden. Funny thing, I never had to spend money on Eddie or Maiden because there was so much around me. The game is alright with all it's little Legend of Dragoon and Diablo references (among others). It works great, looks great, and sounds great!"", 'update (january 2020): the opponent stats do not match actual battles. therefore, it makes for lopsided losses to your team and this needs to be addressed or you will spend a lot trying to make it week to week. plus, it makes the game boring. original (december 2019): my new favorite app or game. the graphics are ridiculously great! the play takes some learning. once you get the hang of it and actually learn to play, kind of like guitar, it unlocks a world that others will never know. have fun.', ""I am a huge fan of the Band. The game is awesome, but can be glitchy! like today, I cant get it to load !!! Would be a perfect game if Technical Support would actually respond!!! 5 emails and not a single response in 2 months!!!! That is going to cost you 3 stars!!!! EDIT: 1 STAR!!! THEY CHANGE THE TIME ON A DUNGEON FROM 8 HOURS TO 2 HOURS AND DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING!!! PLUS THEY STILL REFUSE TO RESPOND TO EMAILS!!! SUPPORT IS THE WORST EVER!!!"", 'Would be WAY BETTER if you would stop the constant updates. Sometimes they\'re huge and take forever and dont seem to change anything. Other times it just takes forever, and it\'s unannounced. I have, literally, lost days worth of ""check-ins"" because of your stupid updates. And there\'s no cooldown clock for the ""check ins""....dumb. Other than that, I love it. Been playing since day 1', ""If you like pay to win, bug bugs and more bugs, with service tickets that never get answered, and developers that just don't care, then this is the game for you. This joke of a developer brings shame to the IRON MAIDEN name. Avoid at all costs."", 'Excellent team building game. Steady in-game currency flow and regular shop deals that make it feel worth the price. Varied skill sets and additional talisman abilities make PvP and PvE very interesting. Overall, a great game to get into if you have the dedication to build a roster of awesome characters.', ""Love the new Christmas theme but You got me good today with that 25% off angel or gambler Eddie fragments. I spent 1000s. Enough to get both & got NONE* i recorded it BTW. also game still doesn't work, pauses or shuts off when doing special events to collect shards, it won't let us. Can you unblock me ** & it Wont work on older devices. & instead of an actual 5 star, all we get are 3 stars with every purchased crystals/soul. We will record proof every weekend of unfair play."", ""It's a fairly good game the only let downs are. When Eddie dies all your fighters die not very fair. Considering some fights the other opponents steal turns and it takes multiple revives to get past. The other thing is to progress you need to collect skulls but it almost impossible to get them."", 'Totally rigged,unfair & unleveled this game has become stagnant. Even Google play won\'t let you mark this game as ""difficult"" just not sure or yes..... Never is this game simple ""No"" it won\'t let you. Can anyone say rigged all the way to the Google store and beyond,Shame! Don\'t waste your time iron maiden the band should say something about this game and it\'s seriously major flaws and it cheats the first forever game to play even after you die! Pass on your account info to fam & friends 😶', 'First off huge fan iron madien and this game covers about every inch of there discogrophy it is an awsome exerience. There is a lot of character building in this you have to really focus on what is good to use and big tip tailsmain are your best strat. The game is moderatly diffcult until you get to the fourth world then all hell breaks loose this is where your build matters you will be crushed if you didnt take care of that. over hundereds of champions to choose is worth the download.', 'I Love The Battle Criteria for this game just a very good foundation and a phenomenal Experience for players. Only thing arguably dislikable is the bugs that usually keep me from playing the game. 5 stars is perfect but I believe there is 100s of things to approve upon. But on the other hand this game is perfectly executed and a good game for any player to enjoy. 10/10 Irons Up', ""Fun but there's a learning curve. The instructions on how to play are confusing at fiest. I learned more from reading the player forums and guides on the internet. That said, once you DO understand how the game works, it's a lot of fun, possibly even a tad addicting. :)"", ""Great hero collection rpg with a thick metal album cover theme. The sound design and the music are worth giving it a whirl. If you love Iron Maiden, you can't go wrong."", ""Shame on YOU.

I was able to reach to level 24 to the power level of 218,000 with almost all legendary gear to the max level as fast as I can. And finally, I've reached the point where doing quest, arenas, and dungeons became super difficult. I really like this game, but it is not worth spending a dime on this game just to get better."", ""It's not a bad game, the ads aren't in your face constantly. And the artwork and graphics may be cartoon like but for cartoon they are nice in my opinion. There's a lot of going here and there, collecting different forms of currencies, but I don't mind, it helps kill some time. The story presentation is really nice. I've got a few hours into this so far. The style of combat is different from anything I've seen. Whoever did the art and story, good job!!!"", ""So far it's a wonderful game. Doesn't bog you down with ads at all, which is such a common practice in the current market. There are SOME menus where you can CHOOSE to watch an ad to get a little extra loot, but it isn't necessary. It's not invasive and anyway. That's the main thing I like about this game so far, is that they don't shove ads down your throat, so unlike what is normal these days. Will write a better, more detailed review after I've played the game for another week or two."", ""Fun game, but can be come repetitive. I've played for 2 months, manage a lvl 3 clan, player lvl 80. I've enjoyed the game, as even though there are pay-to-win elements, pvp is totally optional. Your arena rankings are the only thing that get effected by opting-out, but that's not a huge boon to your experience overall. It's a good past-time that can be challenging at times, so it makes for a good mobile game (in my opinion). Worth downloading and giving a try."", ""I've had this game for about 2 months now, while yes at first it's a pretty fun game it quickly dwindled into a p2w, most of the events now are literally impossible to complete if you don't spend money for an absurd amount of gems or keys, upgrading moves is also such a tedious process that you end up giving up on after they reach level 4. It's also a MUST now to stock up on all your items, which is annoying to no end and takes the fun out of the game, just for an event with bad rewards."", 'I love everything so far! About half an hour in and I have all of these snazzy items. I love how satisfying it is to level up so quickly and gain items quickly, unlike other similar games. Customization is pretty good, thank god for being able to chose gender! Great time killer, occaisonal freeze for around 3 seconds, but other than that the graphics are great.', 'I believe that this game, for seems to be early development, is fantastic. I usually stay away from VIP games and games that use matching, like the default fire, magic and healing matching ""flames"" but this one caught my eye. Very unique gameplay and I have enjoyed it so far, hoping to play a lot more. I have played up to level 9 or 10 and have so far enjoyed the PvE, and I am very excited for PvP. CCG\'s almost never give me what I have experienced in the short time I\'ve played. Great game!', ""Review after 1 week of playtime. Decent ideas and seemingly feature rich game. I've found myself not actually enjoying it and here is why: 90% of my playtime consisted of clicking through dozens of windows to collect whatever freebies the game throws at you. This isn't really optional, since you won't make progress otherwise. Also the game has many synergies from items and whatnot, but everything is waaay too clunky to not become insane when checking stuff and regearing all day."", ""Was a lot of fun until the newest update. Now I feel like in order to get anything meaningful I need to spend a lot of money. The game is pretty generous with gems, but in order to actually participate in the constant events you either need to hoard everything for a long time or break out the credit cards and spend - just using gems won't cut it... it's a shame too as I was really liking the game but this greed really killed it for me."", ""I'm loving this game so far. It provides the player with a TON of different things they can do. It has an awakening system that ALL RPG players love. It has a creative 2D-type character design. The controls are simple and the game provides you with an array of missions, events, chests, and gear to go through as you progress throughout the story."", ""These devs are genuinely dedicated to their game. It has a surprising amount of depth to it. The gameplay isn't particularly enthralling but it's a very social game and the events are fun. The slow grind to the top is pretty satisfying and they're constantly updating. I think they get a bit greedy at times but I haven't spent a cent and am still gaining on people who have spent money. It's a strategy game at heart which is why I enjoy it."", ""Ok so when I downloaded this game to be honest I didn't expect much I just it was another one those games where it basically paid to win, too easy, and it was boring but I was wrong it is actually a fun game and I genuinely enjoy this. Try it out and see if it fits your tastes. ALSO beware ther are loot boxes."", 'Good game so far. Lots to learn, but also lots to do without spending money so far. Seems like purchases are fairly priced, if you don\'t want to grind, but the grind is fun! Edit: More of a ""keep up with a bunch of other stuff rather than actually playing a game"" type game. Advancement was quick to start, but has tapered off now that I\'ve gotten beyond that. Don\'t spend money until you\'re sure you\'re going to play for a long time, cuz I got bored after two weeks.', ""It's intresting enough to play but, boring to progress. The game has a pretty nice reward system however it's not worth putting actual money in it. There are no class systems in game and sometimes you just lose becuase of bad rng. Getting new moves or upgrading your current ones will take forever and the ones you do get seem to be worse then the starting moves."", 'The game is great. There is only one thing that can be added in my opinion, there should be a way to awaken orbs. I am only level 34 , but i have many legendary orbs that are close to level 100 and i have one that is. And i wish there were a way to accede that limit. I hope you consider this suggestion.', ""Game is detailed, nice graphics but lags at times with a decent battle style. Appreciate the auto battle & quick access to quests. Bought the elite pass but not really noticing if its active or why it doesn't count towards VIP status. I think the Skip feature in fighting takes away from the enjoyment of battle-unless you got 3 stars. Dont like how ads for premium purchases are the first thing I see when I get into app. Max Energy should increase as you level & equip type info shud be available"", 'Always ""waiting for server response"". It\'s kinda annoying to know that for every button I click, I had to experience 10-20s of ""waiting for server response."" My Internet connection is fine, so don\'t ask me to check my provider about this', 'Game is so in depth. It has such a range of different items and weapons. I really enjoy been apart of a guild and chating and partaking in different events. I would love if they had tournaments where you could first other place and have rounds leading to the last one standing. Anyway greatngame I highly recommend it😊', ""I played this game for over a week hoping that this might be grind F2P. I have realized that this is a pay to play game by greedy developers. The battles are not that fun anyway, glad I didn't spend any money before deleting."", 'One of the better turn based games I have played this far. Yes there is option to pay to win, but there is also a lot to achieve without having to spend any kind of real currency as well. So far so good! Keep up the good work. 😎😁', ""Only played for about an hour, but it's fun so far! More like a casino than an RPG, so I wouldn't play this to get an engaging story or interesting battle mechanics. It's a time waster, but it's good at it!"", ""First day of playing have played now for 4 hours in real time and the only negative I can account for is the auto feature, for players who don't have alot of time, Great Feature but any player wanting a challenging early on game, not so much. Will carry on playing and hopefully I'll write more."", 'Extremely fun game. When I got it I played it nonstop for 4 hours. The only downside is that you use gems for literally everything. But overall, a very well made game.', ""I'm only just beginning and I'm already absolutely loving this game, it immediately engages you in the game and gives you stuff to do. There are so many aspects but they all work together so we'll."", ""Great turn base battle game, equipment upgrades and variety, don't need to pay to play, but that's always an option. Avatar or character maker, awesome game this far can't wait to see what the upgrade or add to it could be the next summoners war"", ""I'm not that far in. It's pretty fun with a neat combat system. I'm a bit put off by how in your face all of the in-app purchases are, but I haven't hit a glass ceiling without them yet (only 2 hours in though)."", ""Brooooo this game is so fun, I love it i love it i love it. It's easy and it's a cool game to earn things become strong and tbh kill sometime. Thank you for this awesome game guys I think I made about 4 in-app purchases because it's jus so fun and I needa be rich to buy cool stuff. Thank you so much again. I'm bearly a level 8 and already got lots of legendary stuff. Again thank you and plz continue to update this game"", ""I am enjoying the game a lot so far. I don't like the auto-play option in fights because it kinda destroys the gameplay. You can turn it off though so you don't have to use it."", ""I'm only level 8, but so far, I love this game. I like the battle system, the upgrade gear system, and how you can send your hero out on a quest while you're not playing. The idle income is nice too."", 'Really fun and entertaining game. Simple easy controls. Only down side is it is pay to win but otherwise a very fun game to play when bored.', 'So far so good for an RPG. Not much in class selection. Kinda linear, but the beginning gets you taught on how it all works pretty fast. Fun to upgrade.', 'This is a great fun game, the developers have put a lot of effort into the game with very little advertising used only to speed up certain events but this game is super fun with great in depth gameplay.', 'Very good game, good graphics. It gave good reward. I am going to update this review when I get more time with it. But first impression, very good', ""Lots to do. Rewards are not worth getting. Last update destroyed game. Chest spins are just money ripoff. PAY 2 play. Lucky they don't charge you fee to login. Greedy devs! Good app! Ruined by money grabbers."", 'If u keep improving it will be better, but the fights are kind of boring and not much interesting goes on. If they fix that it will an awesome game.', 'Fun in the beginning. However, it quickly turns out, Questland is yet another free-to-play but pay-to-win game. Disappointing', 'Pretty fun game starting out! I hope the changes they make can continue the storyline as it already is going and make it as interesting as it already is.', 'completely different game from a year ago. When I first started playing, the game play was fun and you could compete with high dollar spenders. They have changed every aspect of the game and reduced ability to level up with f2p significantly. Developers have copied pieces of different games and mashed them together, poorly. I have uninstalled after a year of game play. I did pay for monthly contract and occasional boosts, but no longer worth it', 'The game overall is great and has potential to become a enjoyable and fun game. Though at the start of the game u need to be a bit nerfed.', ""So far it's a fun a game very generous with rewards. I like the art style and the fighting mechanics are unique in my opinion.""]"

And if you spend money the sky is the limit!! I love this game!!!!!!', 'There is nothing you can not buy which means total pay to win. Within an hour of a new server big spenders will own the best equipment and heroes which will take months for moderate spenders to achieve and by that time the server is over. Not a problem if you are not matched against them but the war system is able to be manipulated so weak players ALWAYS have to face the very top players in every battle.', 'So far so good. I have only just begun playing and like most mobile hero collection games, pay to win exists. Lucky for me I am a PVE player. PVP is where this game can get a little rough, mainly because you can buy legendary pulls. Like I said, it may even out late game. Who knows. Fun for now though!', ""The game is really fun, and I like that you can still level up offline. I'm glad the game gives players the chance to get s rank characters often, other games don't do that. The only thing I would recommend is a guide somewhere in the game to tell players how to equip there characters. Also what line ups would work best. Thanks for the great game keep up the good work!!"", 'Seriously cool game. Plenty of rewards. A game whoch is actually concerned about the satisfaction of the players and not the makers pockets. The artwork is excellent. But just one suggestion. Introduce a function to manually fight the battles too. This will be a new step towards making the game one of the best. Great job devs👏👏👏', ""I rarely leave written reviews but I actually want to praise this game. Most games like this (AFK heros and others like it) often get you to a point where it can take days if not a week or more to make actual progress unless you open your wallet to do so. This game does have grindy points but they are easily able to be passed and don't require Microtransactions to do so. Overall this game is player friendly and well thought out. It can be Bulky feeling with the menus but nothing's perfect."", 'Just another idle team builder clone. Not the worst ive played but incredibly far from even a good one. Game isnt explained clearly enough, terrible ascension caps, super weak summons (especially considering this is the biggest draw to the game), and reasonably mediocre art. I would skip this one.', ""Excellent work! I've been playing (as pure F2P) your previous game Idle Heroes for years and this game feels very similar in the way I enjoyed but also very refreshing with stunning graphic. It's still quite P2W but that doesn't effect the game it self it just takes longer to obtain things. Overall I am very happy I just would recommend to reconsider in terms of graphics some characters feels having a little bit unnatural posture."", 'Love the game great graphics and good drop rates but xp is so less after you hit to lvl 45 its hard to earn xp and since you will be unlocked everything it takes you like a 10min to complete everything and wait for auto to lvl you up wich takes days .. i wish there were more things to do or allowing us to earn xp from other things too. Great game at the begining but after certain lvl it gets boring cus there is nothing else to do please add new options/dungeons i really love this game', ""Amazing graphics and characters. It's very lovable game but if character action has 3d effects and some live critical damage shot that would've been more impressive. Over all it's a very nice game with very artistic approach. Just what I feel is that while playing it gives you a flat feeling. If it has a bit realistic impact then it would be cherry on cake."", ""I could forgive everything people are complaining about in the game except the lack of vision for long term play. This is not a game you'd want to spend on. Servers die down too soon leaving you with no choice but to quit. I've dropped big money and restarted 10 servers forward after the one where 1st account is died. New server dead too after just a month with 4 newer servers out. Will change this review if this improves if i hadn't uninstalled yet... *** Eh... i already quit. You're welcome."", ""I haven't had any bad experiences this far. But I'm only level 35 with 6 level 100 characters. S class. Which is nothing. I'm sure thing will get way more difficult as I go. I know from what I've seen in the arena I'm not gonna have many good experiences with that. I've got my ass handed to me Everytime I even think about pressing that arena button. But the character artwork is amazing in my eyes and so far game play is good. May change rating later, may not... Love it so far."", ""The game makes you lose to an inferior group of Fighters at random. Even when you are twice their strength. And if you do not watch the whole battle they will deem you as the loser. Even if you are three to four times stronger than the other team. You can sit at 300,000, and lose to somebody who's only 97,000. Completely unfair battles. Spending money does not make a difference you will still lose to an inferior group. Complaining does no good no one answers your email. Just another crappy game."", ""It is really simple, you run through dungeons with your team of hero's that rank from SS, S, A, B, C, D and fight enemies. This game has multiple servers and each server is full of players. Then there is an area where you can fight off other players and raise your ranks to get rewards at the end of each week. After that each hero can be equipped with runes, and equipment to make them alot stronger. However it takes so long to finally fight enemies your might that for the first 24 hours you ..."", 'Grate game so far its very nice to new players, has a lot of things to do and gentaly intrtaining the only thing i feel its missing is a better way to understand your heros strength and what i should upgrade and so. (I could be missing somthing) other than that props to the game waiting to see what it will ofer on the future.', ""The game has got some longevity to it. I've been playing longer than other similar games. Level 63 with 2 SS level characters for only $20 invested over the last month. You could easily drop a bomb on this game if you're not careful but you can have fun for about an hour a day without spending money"", 'Looks good, but there is no gameplay to speak of, auto battle, auto equip, have to wait for ressources to generate to be able to improve your heroes when you are stuck, and there is nothing to do in between. Most pointless game i played so far, and i did try idle games. But well, to each is own, i guess.', 'AMAZING GAME This is like Empires and Puzzles without the Puzzles and more action and custimization. Also ALLOTT CHEAPER WOW!!! I dont see why anyone would complain this game is 80$ cheaper to play and you get so much more value and nobogy should be here complaining about prices. The games graphics and universe is amazing NO ADDS this is a top guality game 5 stars all the way... Finally a great game that wont rip you off...', 'Pay to play. Bad customer service. Refuses to reimburse for any game issues. Get same worthless characters over and over. Very little instructions. Shops keep same items. Guild war is a joke, places you against teams over 100 levels above you so your entire team dies in 1 hit. Game gets boring quickly. After 2 weeks you are level 70 and have to wait on auto grind to progress. Everything for the day can be done in under 10 minutes, then you have to wait 24 hours. Stay away from game.', 'the game looks good and all but for me its unplayable in some way. Every 2-3 minutes i get disconnected. Im playing with normal wifi connection. Im assuming its because of far away servers from my home. Im playing from Albania. Let me know when you guys solve this cause i wanna get back on playing the game, since i like it. For now im uninstalling. No hard feelings. Good job though, game looks really promising!!!', 'Edited review: after playing for a couple of weeks and even paying for VIP, I got tired of the RNG aspect of acquiring heroes by using ""scrolls."" Having to get lucky enough to get a card, then lucky enough to get multiples of that same card to upgrade it, is just terrible RNG odds. I spent $15 on the christmas pack and literally got duplicates of cards I already had. I would rather pay and know what I\'m getting than to pay and get nothing to advance my team of heroes. I uninstalled.', 'Free game progress ends at equipment level 5 after that you have to spend real money to buy evolution stones to upgrade hero equipment! Also leveling is very slow if you don\'t buy privilege card what gives you 300% exp. bonus! So ""free"" game progress ends right at item level 5!', 'Honestly like it more than idle heroes. Just wish that the auto battle x2 speed was faster or that there was a x3 speed. Another annoyance is guild wars always pairs me with the same person and if i make myself a little stronger to try and beat that person it changes them to an even stronger person that i now face over and over. Balance this and take away level caps for stages and would be a better game.', ""Oh it free to pay, but lots to pay for. I actually love that they have a lot to pay for, but too much & too $$$ much is too MUCH...lol That said it's a great game graphics are Great. Only real negatives are I wish we had more control over our characters (in battle) & need to make the x2 (speed of the battles) faster. Too slow if you ask me."", 'I was amazed that DH can make such a game. Great Graphics, great concept, diverse idle game mechanics. Its still a money grab, but not as much as idle heroes is. However the summoning rates are really terrible. I dont know what kind of luck is needed to pull a valid S hero and not the insignificant S ones. On top of that, you would need 3 copies of the same valid S hero inorder to promote. Luck based games dont last long and arent worth the effort or time. What a downside and disappointing...', 'I gave this game 2-stars previously. The main reason of dissatisfaction that I had was the insane monetization in the game. Like all mobile games, unfortunately, this game suffers from the greed disease, spreading in the gaming industry (sad). I gave it 2 more stars because I realize that the game has great support, good gameplay. Points I wished they worked on: The exchange system is great, but I see it pointless to change a HOLY SPIRIT pay the rare shrine totem and get her again. The way this game progresses is quick, and we get rewards in the beginning as some sort of a bait to play more and spend more money. I would hope there are better optimization regarding the economy. The Pros are many though: 1- No energy (That is gorgeous) 2- exchange system (needs fixing) 3- 10 hours auto farming for gold 4- Guaranteed S-rank after 10 Legendary summon This is just a review... I believe this game has a lot of potential and could take the spot and get us rid with the Greedy gotcha games Like the ""Youtube Biggest recent Sponsor (RSL)"" There are so many ideas that could make this game better!', ""Overall fun game with great artwork. I was pleasantly surprised with how the game kept drawing me in. As for paywalls I haven't seen any. The game seems friendly to those not wanting to spend, but provides plenty of options for those looking to build up quickly. Easily stands toe to toe with the other game's in this genre."", ""Great visuals, diverse amount of heroes, good amount of content, balanced, easy to learn, time saving, i could go on with the compliments. This game's only drawback is that it's a bit harsher without the privilege pack witch is quite expensive at 5$us for only 7 days 1.50$ or so would be better. But i wouldn't call it pay to win it just give the player more opportunities."", ""Game is literally trashed once you stopped spending money. In game progress is very slow. In other words, don't spend money or dont waste time on it. I spent somewhere $70 - $100 all these times but now I stopped once I realize my mistake."", ""Would get a 5 but for the poor store. This game is great except that the P2P packages are way too expensive for the very slight benefits that they give. Also, buying diamonds is pretty much worthless due to their limited usage. They have a store but there aren't many good items and those are limited to numbers that aren't often worth buying."", ""The fact that this game literally copied the Ad of Idle Heroes (An actual decent game) just shows that these developers don't care about creativity they just want your money. This app literally stole ALL the elements of the Idle Heroes ad. The only thing they changed was the look of the game. The name Idle Heroes was replaced with destiny summoner and the female voice was changed to compensate this Everything else is a straight copy Not even worth trying, just installed to make this review."", ""Game is allot of fun but guild war is broken. Why do I face the same overpowered guy every guild war. Every single fight that I've done has been against players who's team consists of 1 or 2 heroes who's combined power is higher then my team of 6 heroes. It's boring and unfair. Also, please let us skip campaign missions fully, not sure why we can skip everything in the game except the last level of a campaign stage."", 'Edited review* i think we can all agree that its definetely a very cool game but here are two major downsides. -game file is now massive way over 10 gigs for a mobile game? Wow prepare to piss money away on a large memory SD card at least 32 gigs-64 depending on your phone you have no choice in the matter sooner or later you will need one small and large updates will not stop eventually the game will likely at one point be over or around 20 gigs. -Guild war and arena Unbalanaced', 'Now that i play the game for sometime now! There are some problems : players progress is block heavily, summons limited and neft abyss reward....to encourage players to buy packages to move on! Those packages are plain pay to win mechanics that give those who bought them way more advantage over others! The game can not just have the skin only and rip off players like that so i will not keep this review positive anymore', ""I'm not much for idle games but I kinda like this one. Nice graphics and smooth gameplay. Not very clear when it comes to tips, how to play or how to do certain things though, you just learn things as you go. Pretty cool game though. Good potential."", 'Well for starters i love this game because of my friend. He suggested it to me so i gave it a try. And i love it. It really cool how you can attack online people and kinda gamble persay. So i rate it 5 star because why not!!', 'Its been good so far there are options to persay P2W but i feel like they give you enough resources that you get stronger naturally over playing the game. It doesnt feel like you are wasting your time to the point that you feel like your only option is to purchase anything avalible, not many games accomplish this so thats why I am giving it 5*', ""Good but broken. Barely earn gold through the story so you're forced to buy. GUILD WARS IS SO BROKEN. I can only battle between 1 person. Even after refreshing multiple times, it's the same person. I can forgive other things wrong but that I cannot. Fix it. Fix it. Fix it."", ""So I bought the pack for all rewards without watching ads. NOW i dont get my rewards for the 4x video. It's only giving me half of my idle gold every single time now. What's the deal with that? I was loving the game until I bought that pack. I'd rather watch ads now to get my full value of the 4x offline gold"", ""Pretty good turn-based game. You don't need to spend money to get good heroes and level up, you just gotta login a few times a day. Kinda missing an oomph factor; there's nothing that sticks out about it. But it's a great time waster for whenever you're waiting in line or bored anywhere.""]"

Good luck, Brave Hero!","[""Great game! 5/5 1) advertising doesn't match real game content. -1 2) even played lvl you need to play again to farm items to promote your heroes. Its boring and donators can do it really faster. -1 3) skins give real game advantages. It's super stupid. -1. 4) donators can do everything. Want energy? Emeralds can help with it. Items? You can free raid missions. Gold/exp/anything... -1 Oh, it's 1/5 for now.) Of course you can by each star for 15$ - price of one skin WITH DISCOUNT. Don't play this"", 'Overall, more interesting game content. Unable to save measurements. Every day, help them win the Titans and Heroes Award. The amount of this property may be small. This equipment is required so that the depth of the new equipment weakens with increasing surface. Brings an integrated strategic plan. To join the organization, however, I want and Im not going to jump. We make the most of changes every day. Christmas gifts to take care of each other. very good.', 'It\'s cute, not as interactive as I would like. Pretty basic turn-based game. Don\'t be drawn in by ads that show the ""escape"" puzzles, there are only a couple of those here and there. Not sure where other reviews are coming from with comments on high cost. I\'ve made it pretty far in the past week and haven\'t spent a cent. If you\'re someone who **has** to advance super fast then yes you\'ll have to spend a fair amount of money, but most of these games are that way. Patience-replay some levels.', 'It\'s mediocre at best. It\'s funny that they\'re adding those little puzzles from the advertisements, but there are only 2 in the very beginning. The first one doesn\'t load correctly and it graphically glitchy. The gameplay is cute, but boring. It fights for you, and you control when to use the special moves... or you can set it to auto, meaning the game plays itself. Dear company, pick your ads to actually show the game, not BS interpretive dane to show the ""essence"". You\'re false advertising.', 'I start my morning by collecting energy and finish buying experience potions. Great game a lot of fun to play. I wish there were more ways to get emeralds because so much depend on them. I also play the extra puzzles and social post (like this). Sometimes the reward you with some amazing things. I recommend Watching the videos. They help. The trivia is fun also.', ""I really like this game, you don't HAVE to pay to play, just depends on how much you want to play. Would have given it a 5star rating, but I original downloaded game because I really liked the puzzles in the ad, unfortunately only 2 such levels at beginning of game. No other levels like ad shows, so if your interested in what they show in ad, don't bother it's not here"", ""Fake game ad. It's an epidemic. Fake ads are found in other games, and that needs to stop. The ad is misleading and the actual game is unrelated to it. **RE: New reply from devs: So show the actual game and Not a puzzle of saving your hero from drowning! That doesn't exist. What a ridiculous reply and weak excuse. I know why you use fake ads. Don't pretend with me."", 'I like Hero Wars, first of all for its players, countless friends, everywhere, with great competitive hearts and good teammates, secondly because in itself it is a great game made for competitive people and lovers of challenges and the strategy, a game where you just want to improve and be better than yesterday, and be able to improve yourself tomorrow, a game where a defeat, only inspires you to want to improve your team again and avenge that defeat, a game where Discover your skills, your Strength and His companionship, a game that rewards and loves its users, could continue for several more minutes, but in short, I play Hero Wars mobile, because it is the best game and I the best player. I want a big hug from Spain. and Merry Christmas.', ""After recent update game is very laggy. Lags a lot of things - hero selection, chests opening, screens switching. Also there is some strange label with version and fps, and somme annoying exclamation mark on settings, that can't be dismissed. When opening Christmas quest - game crashes sonetimes. Please fix it, or at least roll back to previous stable version!!! UPD, finnally lags are fixed. increasing my review mark."", ""Game is fun but it's an obvious predatory cash grab. I've spent about $200 and found this out: You have to buy emeralds of you want to get anywhere. Multiple game modes but you can only attack/engage ANYTHING 5 times a day. Each conflict lasts about 1min. None of these give emeralds naturally if you may be asking. Any more and you have to PAY in emeralds. characters cost $30 and most actions translate into 100 emeralds =$1. Every marketplace, energy, battle regen=$.50 each. Any skin =$15 each."", ""Well, I liked the game so much - it doesn't have any ads inside, and its so well designed in graphics. The gameplay is easy and intuitive after you finished first 3 chapters. I have made four in-app purchase to progress a little bit faster but after reaching level 60 I realized the investments I did were in the wrong heroes! So, i decided to move to another server and re-start the game again BUT the PURCHASES and VIP level gets reset :( I get really disappointed since in the game was mentioned the VIP STATUS WAS PERMANENT..."", 'Download war hero puzzle music on the phone and play before playing. Shortly after the match, the techniques and skills developed and I found me as a team for only 76 months and a half. Some modes, defeat, anger games seem to thrive, since then war heroes do not play sports, but my next hero is purple and worked to increase the number of my kingdom Is.', '..... I only want to do the puzzles.... that\'s why I installed it... now that I played through the dialog stops the battle progress which is dumb cause the battle is slow enough you are just preventing me to skip through the battle... and you are forcing me to do all this ""tatorial"" rubbish when I Know How to play games... I just want speed up my progression with no restrictions. Other than that the short time I\'ve played this game it\'s been very very disappointing and a waste of time.', ""I saw the ads and thought it was a puzzle game, it was super misleading. The game is so pushy it blacks out the screen and forces you to go through a constant tutorial and max out your ability to upgrade characters in one shot. Because I had to upgrade your characters, I was destroying enemies before the dialogue at the start of fights ended. The 3d-ish side scrolling maps made me motion sick. It's just a normal RPG."", ""The game is HEAVILY ON THE P2W side of things. There are soooooo many things they want you to spend money on. Even the energy Regen is absurdly slow to the point that if you don't spend money on the game you will only be able to log in and play for maybe 30-45 mins a day tops assuming you're in a guild. At a minimum the energy Regen rate should be doubled or tripled so people can at least play the game a bit more."", ""I only downloaded this game because the ads made it look like it would be a fun puzzle game. It is not a puzzle game at all. They should market the game towards the correct audience instead of tricking people into downloading a game under false pretenses. Complete waste of my time. I don't understand why they would use such misleading ads."", ""False advertising. The game makes you think it's a logic puzzles game, when it's really an rpg. I've reported this game, and encourage everyone else to do the same: * Open the Google Play Store app ￼. Go to the detail page for an app or game. Tap More ￼￼ Flag as inappropriate. Choose a reason. Tap Submit. Btw, Homescapes, Gardenscapes and Zooscapes all have the same type of puzzle ad, when those are really just Match 3 games. I've reported them too."", 'I enjoy this game, however I choose a task to earn gems, completed the task in about 12 hours (12 real time hours playing another game), and then Hero Wars will not honor the task rewards. They have rejected my request for assistance getting the reward, not explaining why. If you fix this major screw up, I will change my rating, but as of now, from my perspective, this company cannot be trusted, and deserves no more than 1 star. Please honor your commitment, and give me my reward.', ""After last update, game crashes constantly for no reason. Video server doesn't work, and half the time you don't get rewards. Gameplay is non-existent, just a grind. Every single package costs an extortion rate, and you really can't progress without buying. All it really has going for it is looking pretty. No story. No real advancement. No connection to characters. It's an RPG in name only."", 'Very fun game. You are severely handicapped by the lack of gems, energy, and gold, especially later on in the game seeing how the requirements to evolve a character are ridiculously high. Also, if you guys are gonna make almost every chest in the tower yield tower coins, then put something worthwhile in the tower shop.', 'slot machine not game... this game should be renamed ""sunk cost fallacy"" as I think many players keep playing due to spending hundreds and thousands on in game upgrades. this game *truly* is only for big spenders as that is the only thing that matters for character advancement. beautiful graphics and cool squad battle animations will draw you in. this game was probably developed by behavioral psychologists who are quite informed at commerce.', ""This game is so heavily monetized that it's taking predatory micto transactions to a new level and I didn't even know that was possible. I've also had numerous things go missing from my inventory and reach out to the devs when this happens only to get zero response. The grind for mid to late game is just not remotely fun. Finally it's BS, having done a ton of tower runs it begins to make zero sense. The enemies at one shot health and low level doing crazy stuff like not dying and repeating ults."", 'i wish it had much less p2w capability. Have to add to simply avoid this. The developers dont know what banace is, and create and keep a clear imbalance of hero power and usefulness. The pc version may be a different story, but I advise staying away from the mobile. its simply a constant cash grab that will leave you with spenders remourse unless you spend on very specific heros. You cant have real fun with this because you will be forced to both spend and copy pasta the same meta heros', 'Expertly designed to separate you from your money. Enough different game modes to keep you interested with lots of different upgrade options available with different currencies which are doled out sparsely enough to make you want a bit more, which, of course, costs real money. The real challenge is resisting and playing for free.', ""It is definitely a well designed game, the problem is that in order to really have any fun you have to pay. It really sucks that you can't really progress without hitting a roadblock and then you have to wait a day for certain energy to regenerate. It is designed to annoy you until you fork over cash after getting frustrated with low progress. A sad waste. I already made 2 purchases, but the game is relentless in getting you to make more in app purchases. Why cant I just purchase it?"", 'Heroes of War is one of the biggest games. It allows you to return to any level of power, and youre interesting. I have never experienced a fun and beautiful game like Hero Wars. Keep up the good work, and as usual I can wait and see what happens. The game is constantly evolving and is not new every day. Even without a gift, I persisted eagerly.', 'Truly disappointed. Do I recommend this game to someone else? Absolutely not. Lets be honest, the pricing is really high and to be treated like liar when you report you didn\'t get what you paid for is really unfortunate. Really seems ingenious to say ""there is nothing that can be done at this point"", when they truly didn\'t attempt to help you. I don\'t know why I just expected to at least get half of what I spent in credit. I don\'t want the money back. Just wanted something, but not nothing...', 'Its ok, like many other games that require to spend a lot of money to get ahead. While most reviews are pointing out. Advertisement is very false. I was expecting to get a different game when i joined. Anyhow, what kept me hooked is that while you can spend hundreds of dollars on it, you dont have to. You can advance in all parts of the game for free. There are no hard limitations on what you can achieve, and ive tried a few where there were plenty of those.', ""ive been playing this game for a month now and realize that the algorithms in this game are garbage.. it's rare to hit a multiplier when you desperately need gold, dungeon challenges constantly choose your weakest titan element to attack over and over til you have to lose early. also their time limited discounts aren't discounts, the prices don't add up to their consistent market.. greedy people.."", ""I Like this game but it takes so long to get anywhere. Everything is expensive and you dont get alot of coins. You basically need the emeralds for everything but they dont come up often unless you pay for them. There is a free option you just have to download a game and play the game and you'll get them. But it's a lie I downloaded the raid shadow legends and got to the level it told me too but I got nothing."", 'Mobile needs work for titans. The dungeon misses the bonuses that the online version has and is harder to clear the higher you go because of it. It also would benefit from the tickets and auto 150 for being VIP. The only good thing is that they havent brought the lvl 130 yet so many people are pretty even and it is just adjusting teams.', ""Great game, but you are at a HUGE disadvantage if you don't spend money on the game. I am not a big fan of this. I understand paying for some premium features, but the general culture of the game is that you need to pay to win. I am definitely against that. I am also okay with one time purchases, but you gotta spend over and over on resources to upgrade your players fast or you are left behind."", ""I like the puzzles and was waiting for them to get harder when the other type of gameplay interrupted. It consists of just watching your heroes walk right slashing demons with borderline no input from the player. I get that devising puzzles takes time but I don't wanna spend 10 hours watching a boring cartoon for 1 hour of puzzles..."", ""Poorly developed, every little thing needs long loadings. I would gladly keep this game if it was only the puzzles and no stupid fight. The puzzles are rarity in this game and a lie for the ads. I played for 20 minutes, 2 minutes was puzzle and 18 minutes watching the stupid characters fight meaninglessly. It's a shame."", 'Do what I do with another hero I love and join the fight. In addition, completely independent (other games). Everyone is wild and powerful, the game is a gift, and there are various bonuses that will help you make your first team. Major events as well as special events. Thank you!', 'Nothing like the ads where you try to solve puzzles. Most game play is just watching characters go to ""war"" on autoplay. You only have control over their special powers. The most common activity you\'ll do is hit ""ok"" when the characters give you useless information.', ""I was initially attracted by the ads cuz the puzzle seems interesting but turns out there's only 2 in game so far which is kind of a let down. However, that's not the biggest nuisance. The biggest problem with the game is that it's very pay 2 win-ish. There're too much in game currency that require players to pay more if they r 2 have a better gameplay exp. Also, tho there're constantly sales going on yet not much of them r really good 1. Still, I'm giving it a 4 cuz there's no 3.5 available"", 'War hero I love to play. There are many heroes and know their skills. I play every day since the download date. Since then, it plays.

I love heroes! etc', ""This game is false, click bait, all videos showing different puzzles fake you get two at start that's it, everything costs money, can't do nothing if your not VIP, all you get is campaign, allowed 5 fights in arena then u need VIP 3, upgrading hero's is joke, also, honestly farmville better this 90% is just computer fights don't waste ur time or data, There no other puzzles as advertised"", 'Game is good apart from when you get to a higher level, you have to either buy stuff or ""earn"" crystals.

Sdorica is a classic fantasy strategy RPG that uses the classic team combo of support, attacker, and tank. Remove the orbs strategically to cast spells, save the world, and achieve your fantasy. There are also adorable monsters for you to breed, and a cooperation system that allows you to fight along with friends and guild members. This fun and fascinating gaming experience is awaiting you!

【Massive, Epic Storyline】
Sdorica has an enormous worldview and an unprecedented epic story. Season 1 takes place in the corrupt Kingdom of the Sun that seems perfect on the outside...but darkness lurks within; Season 2 opens up the Desert Kingdom that's constantly engulfed in the flames of war. Besides the compelling storyline, to make the game more lively, we've invited well-known Japanese CVs to do the voices for each character.

The story hooks you right away with its art and comedy. The combat is exciting and unique, each character has a role and can be used in many different ways. You got to think about each member and how they can contribute to your team. The game has many different modes and each have a purpose. You have the story, events, exploration, sub stories and much more. This game is very free to play! 10/10', 'Please read this. This is urgent. I was on chaoter 2 and then after finishing some of the missions, someyhing pop up and said, failed to write database.. dude 2 servers already andi cant play them anymore. If i change the server same prob occurs. And then my save data is gone. Nothings appearingon the screen. Load and load then back to press any to start. Then load. Load. Then again. Main menu. Please reflect. I love this game. I already uninstalled the game andinstalledit again. Same prob occur', ""I really like this game so far. I wasn't sure about the battle system and it may not be for everyone, I honestly thought it wouldn't be for me; but I was wrong, I actually enjoy it a lot, it keeps me thinking and involved unlike most hero-collectors that have you mostly watching than actually playing. The story, characters, and scenes are very fun, cute, and well made! I really enjoy this game's style, you can tell a lot of love was put into this."", 'PROS: - GREAT art and characters - Fun and unique gameplay that is easy to pick up. - A solid amount of daily and earnable free stuff. - Lots of updates to keep invested CONS: -The more expensive gatcha draws could use some balancing as drawing 1 common material as frequently as I do can be disheartening, and more-so for new players. - The way the exploration camp/quests/ facilities work can be a bit vaguely defined and over-complicated due to their sheer volume.', ""I've been playing for 2 months now and it's honestly a really good game. My only gripe is the crashes that happen fairly frequently. If you play more than 3 hours, you'll probably get 1 or 2. There's a lot to do from character missions, to dailies, the main story, and exploration for materials to upgrade the Exploration camp. The character stories in my opinion are the best part. Followed closely by the main story. All of their stories so far have emotion and are well told. Even Puggi kinda."", ""It used to be a good game but for some reason the recent updates makes it increasingly difficult to get to the title screen, stating that I need a stable connection even though I have a stable connection. When I do connect, it gives me the error box regarding can't connect/please confirm you have a stable connection. Again, there is nothing wrong with my internet, Sdorica just lets me get to the game when it feels like it."", ""I really do enjoy this game (i especially love the art and storyline) , but it gets really frustrating when I can't play the event. My game has crashed at least 20 times now since the new event was added. I cant even play 2 minutes of the event without crashing the game."", 'Art, music, story, voice acting—all are beautiful. The choir has this Deemo -Reborn- feel. There\'s a bit of redundance with words and few grammatical errors but that\'s about all I can address to improve the game. The way they use ""All in all"" instead of ""Anyway"" or ""Regardless"" is a Rayark trademark I have noticed, even in Cytus II, which is humorous in a way.', ""Phenomenal! I love game with enriched storyline and memorable characters. Last game i played that have this kind of storytelling is FF Tactics and now Sdorica is on the same level on my list i'd say. The gameplay is very unique and you can build your team freely and creatively. Anyone who like good story should try this game i can guarantee it will hook you up."", 'I was introduced to sdorica through cytus II and i did not regret downloading the game, it is fun strategic and the graphics are just amazing but the one thing thats keeping me from giving a five star is because when you use certain characters the game starts to lag when you run or sometimes lag in fights for example the new collab character Neko, i hope you can solve this lag problem as i really enjoy this game and so that others may enjoy it to the fullest as well thank you.', ""I used to play this religiously. It's an amazing game. The art is superb, and the music breathtaking. The story is even well done. However I keep running into a bug where the game tells me the server is overcrowded or my internet connection is unstable unless I disable my perfectly fine working wifi. Turning it back on after login works fine, it's just very annoying when I run into it every time I want to play. Still, first game I ever botheted to spend money on."", 'Very fun but laggy is what I can say. From my experience of playing the game for the past few days that I have realized that the cause of so was the background animations. Ive gotten to a few battles where it uses little to no bg animations and it ran very smoothly. I would like to propose a suggestion for the players to have the option to disable it as it creates a laggy gameplay, plus it overheats my phone, and its not only me, other players from discord also have this issue. But superb game', ""So far I think that this is a great game. The only issues I have with it involve bad connections to the server (which could be on my end) and occasionally the combat controls dont register right away. But that doesn't really detract from the experience."", ""This game has amazing story, humor and gameplay. However, this game has a serious problem of repeatedly crashing not only the app, but my entire phone. I can't tell if this is because I have an old phone or the servers are unstable. If I had to recommend this game, I'd advise to have a very good phone. Also, this game can rack up to 2 GB of cache data so you need to clear it on a near daily basis."", 'What happened to this game? It\'s literally impossible to play due to the ""connection errors"" ,and yes my connection is perfectly stable and good. I\'m sure that you already are, but please try and fix this before the cytus event. I am very interested in playing this game again and would hate to not be able to just because of this.', 'It is a good game but not quite i was expecting, it is a story based game that is exceptionaly good but the way it progresses the game is quite dissapointing. I was hoping of a side scrolling or just plainly an open world in progressing the game so i can be inverse on the events of the game but it has good graphics and story but i just dont like how it progresses the game as choosing different levels its a pretty common thing. I was expecting the Another eden type one or evertale', ""Possibly the best game of it's kind. Fantastic story and characters, rich world and lore. Awesome and strategic gameplay where every single character is useful and you have to craft teams that synergize well together rather than just having the highest level and rarity to win. Also, very f2p friendly. Many people say this, but this is the type of game where 90% of people won't spend anything. I've played for 2 months and have 85% of the characters at the highest rarity."", ""I've only played for a few hours and so far I like the characters and the gameplay, matching orbs adds a different level of strategy than smashing attack buttons, and the story is pretty good so far, with each character you unlock having their own unique story outside of the main storyline. The dev also has a unique character that acts like a storyteller to guide you through the first parts of the game which is pretty welcoming, but can feel a little pushy at times."", ""EDIT: FREQUENT CONNECTION ISSUES IN VARIOUS NETWORK, idk why sdorica is picky some network let you play smoothly, some network can't get into the game at all nice visual, nice music. pretty generous to free player. for me its not a game that you can play all day, its a game that you can play once in a while. best gacha game i've played so far"", ""I don't normally review mobile games, but this one really hit the spot for me. I've been playing for about a month now and it's still just as refreshing and rewarding. The graphics, music, and illustrations are lovely, and the gameplay feels so polished. If you like anime, puzzles, and leveling up, this is the game of the Fall."", ""It's been a while since I played a game like this that ACTUALLY has good story and gameplay! This game is very friendly with it's in app purchases; everything in the game is attainable without having to pay real money. You don't have to grind much either cause you can gain items and any currencies quite fast. I appreciate all the effort put into this game hence why I'm leaving this with 5 stars. They deserve it for making such a good game with non-greedy monetization, unlike other similar games."", 'I play this on a Vivo Y15 and it always has connection problems. Its must be with the game alone bc my other games seem to work fine with no connection problems. I really want to play and enjoy the game so it would be nice if this was optimized on more devices. For now i can only give it a low rating on the basis that i cant play 5 minutes of it without getting a connection issue.', ""Though it's a classic* don't pass this one up. For fans of RPG's with actual gameplay and no auto battle, this one is for you. If you're looking for a cookie cutter Vanilla phone game, I'd pass. The game seems to emphasize good party comps to clear content, not the biggest numbers, so it shall remain to be seen if the Gacha is too toxic. *Classic meaning old, when did this release? 2017? -Based on about 5 hours of playtime. Review to be updated if anything changes."", 'The storyline is great and interesting, the characters are well developed and the graphics are beautiful. the fact that you are able to continue the story without worrying about having rare characters is actually good for my wallet. Totally recommended for people looking for a good adventure game.', ""I played this game when it was just released globally... And I feel sad that performance wise, the game gets harder to play. It gets frustrating that I crash every 5 minutes and I can't even play the long awaited Cytus collab event . If somehow there's a way to optimize this game and play it like I used to."", ""I've been playing this game for a while. Been great until yesterday, when I update my firmware to Android 10. I'm going to inform you that I'm basically stuck pitch black at the first loading screen (when the Rayark animation should be). I'm hoping you could assess this issue and update the game."", ""Combat is well designed. A hybrid of turn-based strategy and color-matching. Content is plentiful and adequately challenging. The art style and music are incredible. The story is surprisingly really good. And it's also a fairly F2P friendly game - ranking up characters is simple, if a bit grindy. But, seemingly as a result of this simplicity, the summon rates for even R ranked characters feels far too low. Despite that, Sdorica is a good game overall."", ""I love the art style and music most of all, but the game play itself feels very unique and challenging in its own way. I played this game once a little while ago and my attention eventually wandered elsewhere, ad it does with most games I play, but I'm looking forward to starting over again and staying focused better this time!"", ""One of the most engaging phone apps I've played. The story is interesting, you can delve into brief histories of the characters, & though gems are scarce, it wont stop you from making characters better. The events can sometimes be annoyingly grindy, but the game itself is very interesting. The combat is like a turn based puzzle, but making a match of 4 is sometimes not the best move. It is genuinely fun making a party synergise & calling it your combo. Also plenty of 'husbando' and 'waifu' here."", ""Wow I am really amazed with this game! The graphics are smooth, bright and colorful. The gameplay is rather new to me but it makes it a lot more fun because I can get many combinations from it. The game itself doesn't need stamina so I can play whenever I wanted too and most of all, it isn't pay to win!"", ""I really love this game for its stories and concepts. I think it's very original and the fact that is continually expanding its universe is amazing. However, every update makes the game slower and take up a ridiculous amount of space in my phone. I used to think it very deserving of a 5-star rating, but now it's just a 3-star game to me."", 'A very fun game with an interesting battle system, has a very nice art style to it with great characters and a good story, the gacha system is rather expensive at times, especially if attempting to get a character you may want, but you are give a few ways to get the gems needed.', ""This game looks great and really feels high quality BUT it is not for low end phones. I have a pretty decent phone but everytime I finish a game, it crashes. I would love to play this game and give it a high rating but it's not optimized for low end phones. Please devs. If you can't optimize the game, please have an option to atleast lower graphics. Thank you and I hope you consider this."", ""Not going to lie I think the art and style plus storyline of this game is 11/10 no questions asked. But for some reason each time I play the storyline during a loading screen, the app closes and sends me to my home screen. This has never happen to me before until the recent update came. Please fix this and i'll change this to five stars please!"", ""The animations that have been added to the beginning of the game since I last played it really bring the story to life. The gameplay takes some getting used to but it's satisfying to master. The characters are all charming, and the way the game is set up encourages you to raise as many of them as possible and try all of them out!"", ""Writting 10/10 Multiple story arc, each character have their own story to tell, one of the best main selling of the game. Gameplay 8/10 Mix of Match - 3 with turn based system, rng is involved like in FGO but there's a way to manipulate the orbs. Every fight seems unique because of it. It's fun for some people. Artwork 10/10 Husbandos and Waifus all great Overall a good gacha game, in my opinion Sdorica is best for side game due to nature of how leveling works in this game."", 'Game is sooo slow and buggy. It needs an overhaul BADLY. Less is more at this point. Finally got in. If you have perma-black screen, game needs permission to access storage in order to get in. As said previously, this is a great game. It caters to casual gamers however, so dont expect too much from it on a daily basis.', 'Incredible game with innovative gameplay, well-made characters with minimum repetitiveness, and great presentation. The number of quests available in-game is staggering, but thankfully only about half of them are at all mandatory to collect important daily rewards (crystals & crystallines). Game is vulnerable to lags though, which can mess up orb input which can be fatal to your team at high level battles. Also, Exploration-related features lack decent tutorial which make them quite confusing.', 'Very good game, played it for one year. it is very detailed it goes pretty well with the more art on the story the game is very simple connecting 2 or 4 flames of gold purple or silver and tapping the advisor of your team which is either an enhancer attack or healer i like how you made all the collab characters more detailed aswell as the other characters but the only problem is i start crashing over and over again since the beginning of the game and it was getting annoying in quest pls fix it.', ""I never thought I'd see myself enjoying this game after getting it. I expected more on the gacha salt like game, but no, it's great story driven game with good characters. The art and gameplay is also praise worthy, in my opinion. I'll recommend this to folks who want some story.""]"

Lord McBucket","[""I've played the game for a few days and I really enjoyed it, but now I can't see chests in shop! There are only in-app purchases, which is unacceptable! How can I progress? Only option is to pay money? ZERO STARS 👎 P.S. I think you should inform your support and help. If I go through all the support things, I'm better of deleting the game and problem solved 😃"", ""New players be warned. The new update system for runes, which is a big part of the game, means you would be upgrading 1 rune every 4 to 6 months of daily playing. It will lock you down, because you cant buy the runes necessary to smash into a stronger one. The game has it's fair share of bugs, and the devs are out of touch with the fan base. Tl;dr is you are better off with other games."", 'Amazing game, so many events and achievements and things to do. Very good graphics also, for a mobile game, i would only like to add that sometimes, my loafing screen takes very long even tho i have good internet conexion, but anything else is working exactly how a game so good would. I recommend it ! And i also hope for a multiplayer in the later updates like co-op, pvp or pve :))', 'Starting w/ the PROS: the game was entertaining with funny story & rpg like customization. Graphics were also nice with cartoonish details. As for the CONS: can only played ONLINE, in-game options & UI constantly lags in comparison to other games of the same genre, & ads like the interactive ones causes the game to stop. My suggestion is to lessen loading time & add low graphics. Overall, only recommendable to people with high spec phones & fast internet. P.S. please fix the questions below.', 'Been playing for about 2 months and was enjoying the game as F2P. This week they unveiled a new rune upgrade system that just killed the little enjoyment in the game. This game is very much pay to win but the new rune upgrade system makes it damn near impossible for free to play players and also anyone new trying to start in the game. Ubisoft make the system better or roll back to what you had before.', 'Good luck getting prompt support. Also, once you do get support, dont expect it to fix the issue you are having. Further, don\'t expect them to take any action in your case other than the technician/s repeating generic suggestions which are easily found on the web but will not help you. Ubisoft may apologize but they wont help. Useless. Now, months later.. they never tried to repair that issue. Except to make some empty meaningless comment that they ""care"". Thoughts and prayers are no substitute.', ""I thought pretty hard to find the negatives in this game and all I could come up with are the nutty microtransactions, akin to any modern Ubisoft title. Controls are good, there's lots of content, satisfying level up rewards and cool events. The game audio is quite nice and the animations are very smooth. I've actually found this game fun enough to put money into... So there you go. You win this time, Ubisoft."", ""I have been playing since launch and like the game a lot. The dev's have made some great improvements BUT for every improvement they change or add something that makes the game worse.The most recent change being the rune system. Players have been asking for a non RNG system for upgrading runes. Devs finally implement it but cost of upgrading runes is now 5X's what is was before even with RNG. Making it almost impossible for new players to catch up to people who have been playing before update."", ""Downloaded this game today, was enjoying the gameplay up until the application kept crashing when loading ACT 1 Castle 2, under adventure. I restarted my phone presuming that would help but still the same issue. Can't even play this new adventure and each time, my energy points keep getting deducted as though I played when Castle 2 forced an exit of the app upon loading to a 100%. Disappointed."", 'Good game. Very grindy as you go through the castles. Literally EVERYTHING is monetised, however, they are very generous with challenges for free premium currency. The only downside is the time limited events, where people who pay win every time. Its impossible to win these events without paying. However you can usually get the limited items at some other point eventually.', ""Fun game but very unfriendly to new players. I started playing because as a For Honor player I was interested in the Valkyrie event but it's nearly impossible to play the event as a new player, you barely get any rewards, meaning you have to get through MTXs to have a chance at getting the Valk gear, and it's not cheap. The Battle Pass is the same,most quests are for high level players so even if you buy it you probably won't be able to get all the rewards. Decent game but that ruined it for me."", ""I've been playing this game for a while now and I can safely say I'm still enjoying it. However, it seems with each new update comes more reasons to decrease my rating. The latest update reworked the rune upgrade system and it is now more tedious and expensive to do so, it also made the guild boss' attacks invisible making it very hard to dodge them. Ads everytime you return to the main menu gets annoying but aside from the negatives, it's a game worth playing. Moreto saybutnot enough characters"", ""I liked the game,the people are nice,the graphics are good,the game's simple but nice although after the recent update, the rune upgrade system became a bit disappointing since the price to pay just to upgrade the runes seems to be overpriced even though it's okay that now we could use leftover runes,but i think, as well as others think the price doesn't suit it, it is getting longer and harder to upgrade runes and very unfriendly to new players as well."", ""Seems pretty smooth in terms of controls, the gameplay lacks a little and struggles to keep you drawn into the battle. Visually satisfying but also quite bland and boring which means it may run well on most devices. The tutorials that you get dragged into back-to-back when you first play this game is insane, it just keeps going and you don't get a chance to freely browse the menus until you are finished 30-60 minutes later. By that time you realise the lootboxes."", ""I very enjoyed this game a lot. So, I decide to make a subscription to get my experience with this game to another level. However, I don't get anything as described for subscribers. Then, I made a complaint about this via email a couple of days ago but there is no response from them. So, beware to subscribe to this game. It's a scam!"", 'This was a really fun game until the newest update. Made leveling runes way to expensive and unobtainable. My guess is to make you spend more money. I did have a subscription to this game but just canceled it until they resolve this and make it more obtainable.', ""Overall, the game is quite nice, addictive and fun. Nevertheless, the pop-up ads are really annoying, this game is amazing and it is sad that ads are ruining it. I'm ok with the ads that you have to go through to open chests, but the pop-up are just taking my fun away with no reward whatsoever."", ""You're definitely stealing everyone's money on lootboxes. The sum of each event pack cost (In Mexico) is a total of $1,278.50, that's a complete price for a new and even better game on an Xbox (AC Odessy as example) and purchasing all event packs doesn't guarantee that you got the full set armor you're promoting!! 1,278.50 are 100 tries of the lootbox, which I have done and NEVER got a complete set of week! and you do this every week, as if everyone has the money to buy a new AC Odessy each week"", 'Ubisoft done a pretty good job at this game, easy controls and super easy loot. The only issue is that I would like for this game to have more options in the arena, rather than just a free-for-all. Like, defending an objective, a 4v4, etc.', ""I wish i there are control button for player to chose to set up, at least when after the character roll up, it won't just stop at there. This is where i find the control kinda stop the whole combo motion for me. Anyway, i love the grinding, graphics, n gamplay. Thank you :)"", ""Bought a key pass in game, and never received it. Left a review stating my problem, they contacted me and gave me information that was incorrect. They said there was an option in settings I could use to contact them, but that option didn't exist. They also gave me a site link to contact them with, but apparently you have to have an Ubisoft account just to receive support from them. Plus they apparently had my original review deleted. At this point, they can just keep the money. It was only $5."", ""Too many ads and micro transactions. If you could pay like 3$ to avoid being splashed by annoying ads every 5 minutes, it would be way better. And there's so much stuff you can't unlock because it's behind a frickin paywall. Please Ubisoft, make a paid version. Thanks"", ""The game is good but energy takes too long to to regain, money and keys are also really hard to get. But other than that it's an amazing game and I can't wait too for more update with more armors and different types of weapons."", 'I thought it was the best game, but Its not. I think I lost my account, everytime I log-in it says ""connection error. Network issue"" my internet is strong. I already ask for help from support but nothings happen. 2weeks I cant play, and did not finished the season pass. :(', ""Not bad, simple but real gameplay. It would be 5 star if this game didn't have so much advertising. Guy's, we know that it's very hard to stay cool when you can make so free money, but you have to be more humble."", ""This was a great game, but they have increased the ads almost to the point of unbearable. It's one thing to watch an ad for a free chest, it's something worse to have to watch it because your switched menus."", 'The game is ok despite it being massively P2W. But the one problem that is extrly annoying is the adds thay you are forced to watch in the main screen.

Beforehand, I did every single discounted 1st time 11x draw for characters and weapons, and didn't get anything but 2 and 3*s. Since then (especially with all the recent free scouts), I've been getting 4*s often. In the last week alone, I've gotten 4x 4*s. Grinding to lvl them and their gear is still very time consuming, but now it at least feels more justifiable and satisfying to put in the effort."", 'I love SAO. This is a very stiff representation of the series. Plus the LIE about the game requirements! 58 mb? Not hardly. Immediately you have to dl another 56 mb. You are then put into the tutorial. After that you are prompted to dl another 1.5 GB! Really? Why not disclose how much space you need up front? Does google protect even cover this huge dl?', ""Good game, ftp freindly, only thing i find really annoying is just about everyday they have a small update a hot patch if you will... but the frequency that they do these is so annoying if you get lucky and they don't do a patch update well they will the next day so don't worry... also i don't have the time to no lofe this game which is needed if you wanna stay ftp the events don't last long enough for me to grind most of the time i miss out. Developers are great and respond quickly to issues"", 'The game is quite fun, now im a pure SAO fan but the game feels slow to get from one mission to the next and the scouts dont get me started the drop chance for the 4 stars you want, forget it. Iv played since release and grinded for hours on end for all the memory cubes i can get out of the game... and yet the only 4 stars iv gotten were given freely by the game... i love SAO but i think im going to uninstall the drop rates are so awful as i really wanted to yuna and like always i get nothing!', ""Terrible game with imbalanced and horribly unfair gacha. There is a gun and bow user, but everyone else uses swords. Just imagine sixty characters that have swords but only two with alt weapons so out of eleven diamond rolls, three of your weapons are not even useable. Garbage. AP makes the game slow, which is sad considering how good it looks on the surface. Bad bad game. Don't spend money on it whatsoever. Don't waste your time."", ""For some reason, my old review isn't here anymore. But, my main problem is the 4 star guarannteed ticket. I got it from Custom of love, but when I checked scout, there was nothing. I couldn't press the • • • option in scout. Tried again in the confusion event, but no dice. Both took alot of time, and i'm pretty angry about it. Fix please."", ""This is one of the best SAO games i played. The turn-based combat can really make you think, and the items arent that common so you can't lvl up to max right off the bat, which makes things fell more balanced. Plus the events give great info about the background of alicization. So yeah, good stuff."", 'This game really reminds me of the old Pokémon days we had! In a good way I like the nostalgic vibes of the battle system. With that being said, love the graphics design and characters implemented from the original Sao saga. Great touch! Came here from SaoMD and I think I like this better :))', ""Bandi fix your damn game. I did the new scout that JUST came out for the endless blue skies Sinon and I got it on the free scout but I didn't see her in my characters. I wasted 225 diamond cubes and got a R2 bow for the weapon thinking I had her and I didn't and I ended up wasting ALL my diamonds. Can y'all do something about this please?"", 'By far the games really good! Love the gameplay and how they cover more of the story background of Alicization. This is by far the best one for mobile unlike Memory defrag this is more free to play friendly. Keep up the good work! as I am looking forward to new upcoming contents. Otherwise only thing that looks funky is how they look during gameplay head angle etc and the adventuring animation how they move reminds me of Scooby Doo running animation.', ""Game falls off with characters. Everyone wants to start off with Kirito and he's next to impossible to get. I don't want to be stuck 100+hrs playing with characters that look like 1yr old girls until I get a unit I actually want to play. There should be at least a 1x character select at the beginning of the game. The game is decent otherwise playing boring characters."", ""Looks good so far... plenty of story and resources, but can't be played on the go. It's missing a star (and I uninstalled it) because it is unplayable on mobiles with battery saving on: when the screen turns off, instead of locking the app it loses the session and it has to login again and navigate to the same place."", 'Huge fan of SAO, great work. Much more engaging, simple yet strategic, and more immersive than the previous mobile SAO games. Feels more like the original games from console, but less time-intensive. I love the creative use of cut scenes which make it feel more like anime!', ""Great for SAO fan AND non-SAO fans immersive turn base gameplay faithful to the anime the story mode is that good, the rates are what you would expect from a recent gacha game but makes it reasonable with a discount summon for each new banner gotta be careful on what you summon on between the weapon scout or character scout would suggest investing on weapons since they're less costly and useful for future units also the events and story will provide you alot of in-game currency great Content!"", ""This is a great game for SAO. But seriously, fix the gacha rate... I'm close to quit though, each of your boss event is disastrously hard without a matched element : The last two event is wind(I don't have any fire unit, spend 1000 cubes in Valentine banner for nothing...) and the next event is a dark elemental( I only have Kid Alice as a light elemental). You need to make the game enjoyable even if players don't have specific unit... I really ike this game... Except for the creepy rate😂"", ""Of what I've seen so far is this game hits more to the anime series then the other one. All I can say for now, as I haven't played enough to say much more. Edit - I'm assuming if your phone died and didnt save psw and all your game died with it and no way to recover."", ""It's kind of boring. And you need energy/stamina to do quests, which is pretty bad. Also the chance of getting a good weapon is really low.. They've updated the weapon chances, I recently have six 4 star characters and 4 weapons, they have changed the chances of getting 4 star weapons, I currently have four 4 star weapons!"", 'I probably just dislike the missing of a ""No Battle Animations"" but this game it\'s absolutely fantastic, it not only give you an amazing gameplay they also make little short Animations that have sense with the history. 9/10 P.D. best pulling rates for 4 stars could also make this game better. I think every 4* below %1 it\'s a little bit unfair having also weapons from pull mechanics', 'Good: Beautiful interface, characters and stories. Bad: Horrible gacha rate, 0% for 4*. Overpriced IAP. No sweep or skip battle function even if you max star a stage, so players have to meaninglessly run their phones 24/7 to power up, which is rhe worst leveling mechanic ever.', ""Had to bring my review down from a 5 star to a 1 star as I can't get into the app at all as it force closes immediately. I have tried everything to my knowledge except uninstalling as I did not set up a transfer and will most likely lose everything."", 'mini alice dupe from ordinal battle vol 4 only give 10 freaking trash alice crystal? furthermore there is no description whatsoever on the shop until we buy it and get scammed. stupid move bandai, very very stupid, as if the SS rank rewards is not bad enough. damn I really2 dissapointed. time to say goodbye for good I guess. you stingy ass publisher', 'After 30 minutes of the game forcing me through tutorials and skipping a few dozen cutscenes I turned it off and deleted it. Really frustrating that the game wants to play itself instead of letting me experience it for myself.', 'Summoning system bad, i have been grinding diamonds but the rate they offer are so trash that i have been getting nothing but 2-3 stars character or weapons. Thats not all, they honestly need to fix the bug which i sometime cannot open/login into game to claim free stuff.', 'This is a really great game to actually play! But the luck on getting 4 star characters or weapons is a bit way too low....... Maybe try to higher it by a bit??? :D', ""Needs a step up banner with guaranteed unit on final step up, have used money and it's not worth it to just end up getting 2 and 3 stars. I'll just stick to f2p from now on and pray I get new characters on the first discount pull."", ""Feels more like an anime than a game... I'd rather watch the show instead. If i could have completely turned off animations i would have liked it more."", ""It's a great game, great controls, great gameplay, awesome animation, though getting new characters and weapons aren't cheap..."", 'I would give it higher but it seems to crash often on my phone in the middle of battle and in field, great upgrade from pervious games though.', 'The game is great. The problems are the continuous messages of disconnection in game and during download and various error messages while playing.', 'Fun game and lots to do but they need to allow me to skip animations when farming takes me far much longer than needed. Edit. Although I still love this game I had to unfortunately quit due to terrible rates, when you play a game from launch and have yet to pull anything outside a guarantee banner here and there its very disappointing to say the least. Please increase rates every 10 pull you dont get a 4 star character, maybe after 50 plus a guarantee.', 'I just started and had mixed feelings due to people reviews and with a short time I believe its a fantastic game. But again just started, the only thing I could say is the control is different instead of tapping. The combat system Im familiar with from other games are good but still learning the ropes of all its features. Lastly, the graphic is not that bad granted it does consume alot of megabites of the phone but creativity is spectacular. I hope this helps further development in the game.', ""Its a good game so far. But its not really balanced mostly for character. 3* in this game is pretty useless, cause it doesn't do much damage and other. So 4* character will be very needed to do some stuff on this game. And there is one more thing, i don't know it is a bug or not, but you have to download the file again after doing Data Transfer. If it was a bug or glitch, please fix it. Thanks"", ""Having issues with 4* tickets not able to be used after hours of grinding for them and it's only available until the end of February"", ""I like this game and the fact I can earn scouting without having to pay is awesome. My only complaint is the VS mode. If one person lives on the enemy team you lose. So if you have all 5 and they only have one person left with one health and your out of turns that's it you lose. It should be based of party and health percentage."", ""I love the graphic. And play this game for it's story. If you're looking for full action this might dissapoint you in a way."", ""C'mon this is so unfair when I play the game yesterday it was just good with no bugs but today just this morning when I open it it wonk work and when it did my progress was gone ."", ""My biggest rant for the game is in upgrading character. There's a huge difference between 3* and 4*. 3* character only need 20, but 4* character use 100 upgrading mats. Developer should consider lowering this requirement. The strong point and most useful game mechanism is auto play. I think developer should explore to provide more customization in that area. Thanks again for this wonderful game. As a SAO fans, I'm looking forward for it."", 'Awesome game! Love the anime. But.... I have contacted support and they are utterly useless. I question their probability rates for scout and suggested there might be a bug in the system. Has anyone here scouted ""Budding Justice Ronie"" more than 10 times on every single 11x scout??? Cause I have, on both gems and tickets. Out of every character listed I only get her. I\'m now at the point where I\'m scared to use my gems. I just scouted the new event and you would never guess you I scouted!!!', ""I edited the ranking because of some errors encountered. 1. I cannot limit break the ring from Dark territory quest. An error code was detected. 2. From the Squadron Event, when I finish the main story as well as the boss event. I can't access the hidden story even if I have 2k+ keys that can unlock the hidden story. Please do something about it. I really love this game. Shall revise the rating once it's fixed."", 'Good art, almost no bug ingame. BUT why is there so much update? Like way too many. 3 to 4 update a week is NOT normal. This game is definately not a slow mobile data friendly. I rarely play this anymore because of this. When I just want to play for login and doing some quest, it always says update. Please, just make the update once a week. And one more thing, I know that the update come from new event, but you guys have toooo many event. Let the player rest.']"

It's meant to be hard, all these ADHD kids want is a point and click adventure and this is way beyond their comprehension. One of the best Android games out here right now!"", ""This game is incredible. And it's quite hard as well. But the hardness itself is what makes this game so addictive and unique. The hunger system and weapon strength limitations are essential to this game, and those who complain about it clearly don't know what a rogue-like game is about and why it is fun. If you want a game that is easy, than don't play this game."", ""The Starving to food availability ratio is way off.

A classic game and if you enjoy it I'd check out the modded varients."", ""Last floors are pretty impossible. Even with everything maxed. The enemies are too powerful. Also last boss is sane. I get that it shouldn't be easy but... that's pretty impossible. And add more secret stuff. Like the rat king room. A secret story could be great. And secret boss with secret ending. Like the idea of choosing to finish it when you get the amulet or go back to the top and finish it there. I mean its the same ending both ways it's just not funny."", 'Ive played many different mod PDs and I think this is the origional but: -With no update in five years I didnt even consider donating -U pick up items imedeatly apon clicking on them to move to that spot which messes U up in fights -Dew doesnt go in Ur vial, instead goes in Ur health first and when U have max health & vial it just disapears when U tap it Thats what I gathered after playing 3 floors I quit after that because theres games that fixd these and are just way better than this rn', ""Amazing for a free game although it can be quite difficult - I don't think this is updated at all but it could certainly use a variety of difficulty options.

Many different builds to try out. The luck aspect is a little infuriating some items work well with another item but not well at all by itself.

The game requires tremendous patience and outmaneuvers. Other than that 5 stars.', 'The gameplay was cool, but It was kind of hard. It just dropped you into the game with no instructions at all. It was cool though. But also, sometimes the pirannahs or monsters would be really swarming all the time, and You would die instantly. It was a big challenge though.', ""The classic! One of the great dungeon-crawler roguelikes. But I think it's best feature is that it's open source and has created a huge and fascinating culture of mods. Remember, if you like one of those, to come back and show love to the original."", ""This game punishes you for taking your time. It punishes you for not taking your time. It punishes you whenever it can, even when you do everything right. It's just a complete mess of arbitrarily randomized nonsense deaigned to be punishing for masochism's sake. The dev BADLY needs a therapist because someone obviously did horrible things to them for them to create this thing. Its not a game; it is a cry for help."", ""One of my favorite mobile games. It seems simple, but the more you play, the more depth you find in it. I will admit, it's incredibly difficult though. I've been on and off paying for almost 2 years, and still haven't beaten it, though that's part of what keeps bringing me back."", ""For the people that haven't played this yet, go ahead and give it a try and get a feel for it, but once you get fed up with your armor and weapons breaking from repeated use after upgrading them, you're probably better off playing one of the mods. This is a brilliant game that's ruined by that dreadful degradation system. Please, game developers, I'M BEGGING YOU, FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT IS FUN, GET RID OF THAT HORRIBLE TRAVESTY OF AN UPDATE!!! Do that, and I'll give this game 5 stars."", 'Very enjoyable to play. Very challenging - you need to enjoy the game and not the winning. Very well written code. It could use a more diverse skill system (other mods have tried). But it keeps the game simple.', 'This is a great game that many people automatically give a negative review because it is too hard. Give it a chance; once you get more experience, the game will seem amazing!', 'This game is the best! The music is buetiful and gose along very well with the setting. The game is randomized everytime making this game adictive. Props to the team who made this wonderful game!', ""This game reminded me of a game I played on Xbox 360 I can't remember the name of. The enemies seem as difficult and other aspects of the game seem very similar. Somehow though this game is harder. Whether it is because of more fat finger mistakes costing precious moves leading to faster deaths or the ui is just scaled to be more difficult, I'm not sure. I just know after a week of playing and never getting much further than the second boss, I'm sick of dying all the time. Bye."", ""I love this game, it is one of the few rpgs that doesn't have demonic or spiritual stuff in it which is great also. I would have given it a 5 but t does get a little repeative .

But worth it. Been playing this for years now and it has always been the best game ive ever played on mobile. Plus as a extra bonus. There are 0! Micro payments or adds. Thank you.', ""Challenging dungeon crawler. This game is rewarding if you're patient and VERY punishing if you rush too much. I enjoy playing even though I've only finished it two times.

Great design that many other mods have built on top of."", ""This game is honestly fantastic! If you love old school roguelike RPGs, this is a must try! Cons: I will say it can be frustrating, as the levels are procedurally generated causing it to be a bit random. Also after each boss the next area becomes MUCH harder. (Still haven't beaten the game yet...) But this lead into the pros... Pros: Lots of replayability due to the random generation. And because of the difficulty spikes it leaves you coming back for more, always having learned something new. Each class is fun to play and has things that make them each uniquely viable."", 'I loved that you could go around in this old school dungeon crawler and find items to survive. One bad thing is that the descriptions for each item is a little long and should be simpler. Besides that this game was awesome.', ""It's challenging and each game is random.

The Greedy Cave,com.avalon.cave,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.avalon.cave&hl=en&gl=us,"In a land far, far away there once was a vast continent called Milton. It was a land where the power of rule came by the sword and the arcane, where Men who devoted themselves to the blade or to magecraft, could become the finest warriors, wisest wizards or the greatest adventurers. In this land, there are several kingdoms divided by borders but united through history. Countless stories of alliances, upheaval, and moments of peace bedeck this tapestry, but that is a tale for another day. 

Our story begins in a remote kingdom to the north, Iblis, an obscure and oft-forgotten place. It is a wild and barren land, a place where its people scrape a living from the earth, mining minerals for the lords of the south. On occasion, adventurers would stop by for the night but never linger. Until one day, a fledgling adventurer lost his way and stumbled into a hole. The story might have ended then had he not come back, but return he did, with sacks of gold and glittering treasure. 

Like a fierce gale from the north, news of his fame and fortune fanned across the kingdoms overnight, and kings sent their bravest warriors and adventurers to clear the cavern of monsters in search of treasure. Even peasants wanting a part of this newfound wealth partook in these expeditions. In no time at all, a bustling town had sprung up in this forgotten place. People set up camps, and formed their own groups to explore the cave. Clever merchants not missing this opportunity, built taverns and shops near the cave, selling equipment and potions to eager adventurers. At first everything seemed fine. As explorers delved into the caves, they encountered new creatures and discovered new treasures. Mysteries continued to poured forth from the cave, yet nobody knew where the source of the secrets lay. However, as the explorations continued, the balance of wealth beyond the cave began to waver, and cracks appeared among those adventurers who had previously worked arm-in-arm. The latecomers or weak, limited to wandering the upper levels of the cave, could only watch as the veteran adventurers brought treasure after treasure from the deep. They began harboring dark thoughts as they watched the veteran adventurers grow arrogant from their largesse, ordering people around, hoarding secrets from the rest. The place became a festering pool of suspicions and greed, mired in jealous rage. 

It started with an adventurer disappearing in the cave. Rumors circulated he had found some legendary treasure and hoarded it for himself. Others said he had been guided to another world by some mysterious magic force in the cave. Still the unspoken belief was that he had been murdered by a rival party and was buried somewhere beneath the caverns. Nobody knows exactly what happened, but people have continued to disappear ever since. As more people have gone missing, some adventurers have called it quits, others cling to hope, and a few continue to wait and see. Which brings us to you, an ordinary young man, coming into this extraordinary circumstance with purposes unknown to others. May you find what you seek in ...

--------------------------------------------------------
In ""The Greedy Cave"", you are a brave adventurer tasked with exploring a mysterious cave and battling all kinds of monsters.

Use your wits to defeat them, learn different skills, gain mighty equipment, challenge evil monster bosses, and decipher the mysterious surrounding this cave...

Enemies are creatively modeled from what seems quite original; apart from the Tim Berton esk, Don't Starve vibe. For me personally, I didn't enjoy seeing other players that spent a lot of time in the game. As the idea might be motivating to some, the chore to ignore instinct to compare my adventure to other's becomes apparent. If there was a passive filter to show slightly advanced players, that might fix focus."", ""Update: Reinstalled after updates passed. Works great now. It's honestly a pretty neat game but just missed the mark for my currents interests. I prefer something a little more long term grindy rpg feeling.

For example the company could start with the fighting pits cleared with the exp and gold, slightly upgraded equipment and such.

A great time waster. It's fun, and handles ok. However...there are flaws. Lemme be blunt. The combat is wack. It can be good, but there are several senarios you'll he faced with a large group of enemies. Most I ever saw was...10 or 12? And you only have 4 and that's with a perk. It's super unbalanced. When you have to rely on the random environment to bring a helping hand it's bad game design. Especially because enemies can easily swarm you. The quests tho are amazing."", ""I seriously love this game. It is exactly the kind of classic rpg I would like to play regularly on my phone. The storylines you can follow are interesting enough, they're not the most unique but are well written.

Maybe there's something like that later in the game, but I'm not playing the same game a fourth time when the combat is as boring and shallow as it is. At least take away my characters or something instead of my save file"", ""A nice rogue like game, but I have a few quality of life suggestions for the creators. First, it's kind of dumb that you have to unlock the ability to wait on your turn. This is especially annoying when having a monk escort; he of all people should have the discipline to wait on his turn. Next, what is the deal with archery? I don't understand it. The number of spaces one can shoot and what direction seems arbitrary. Take some notes from the d&d handbook, can't say more because word limit."", ""Absolutely love it. The only reason why this isn't a five star review, is probably because I feel that the resolve system is a bit broken. There should ideally be more ways to earn resolve, currently the girl who you rescue is the only one. I hate retiring party members because of low resolve caused by injuries. Otherwise the game is amazing, and it really takes me back to my old school RPG days. Can't wait for future updates!!"", 'Once you get until the flow and understand how the mechanics with this is a very entertaining turn based strategy game! The variety of general quests and character-specific personal quests makes the journey so rewarding with each playthrough. However the no-saves perma-death rule makes 200% TRULY a challenge!', ""This is honestly one of the best games there are on mobile. I love it and the only problem I found is that there is a lack in content after a while and there are few characters which are always the same on every adventure except for the founder. My suggestion is for your previous company's founders can appear as recruitable adventurers on latter adventures."", ""I don't even know what to say, I'm speechless in terms of how good this game is. I expected a dumb ad-filled mobile game, but instead got a classic rpg experience full of adventure, exploration and most importantly, fun gameplay. It's a game simple enough that I can pick it up and play it for a few minutes, but also a game I can enjoy during long gaming sessions. I would buy the ad-free version, but with ads I know I can support you infinitely. Pozdrav braćo srbi!"", ""A gem of a game. Hours of fun playtime, only few ads (which can be turned off for a fair low price, which gives bonus game options in doing so), doesn't require internet connection, no bugs, and an old school fun experience with surprises at every turn. This is a passion project of the dev and it really shows, no corporate bs and just plain awesome. I hope he gets more support so we can get those updates rolling."", 'This is really awesome game. I just wish it has more new map for more exciting adventure. EDIT: However, the enemy encounter option (Bandit) is a bit off. I think we could evade the battle without having specific character, but the chance are lower.', ""I love this game because in mobile, there had no games like this before. Simple. Interesting. And if you like reading aaand RPG you'll really love this game. Problem: I can't continue the quest in Capriss when a scholar asked me to go to Old Volinth(or something) to get his papers. When I got there there was suddenly a bear I wasn't ready and backed out of Old Volinth but when I came back there it says that there was nothing an was forced to go back. Edit: Oh thanks it worked ☺."", 'Honestly I think that a more in depth storyline would hook better maby a overarching enemy or a larger map the only issue with the game is that it gets a bit repetitive and you reach the border too quickly if you could add a much larger map it would be thrilling and a more in depth lore and maybe even magic would make it a even more unique experience', ""Honestly this is the only rogue-like game that ever got me attached to a pixelated character. I felt literal emotional pain when my favorite character died after a hard-fought battle. After that event I felt this deep prolonged emptiness whenever I venture with my newly hired adventures. ): It's a great game overall and definitely worth the time and effort to spend. Great job to the devs. 👌"", ""I only recently got this game and like it a lot BUT I am dyslexic, and the font used in the game makes it very hard for me to read. I love the vibes the game has, I just think maybe if the words words were a bit bigger it'd help?"", ""What a great game, the writing is very good! But the small map disappoints. I hope there will be an update which expands the world map with new regions, new maps to buy. Overall, I had a nice a gameplay which is only completed in a day which is sad. I wish there were lots of questlines in the future update. And Not just bears, wolves and escorts. I wished there is a longer questline, like factions questlines in skyrim! I'll looked foward in the next update."", ""really cool game that reminds me of retro rpgs. the writing and gameplay are well-thought out and fun. would get a full 5-star rating if there was a non-permadeath mode for sore losers like me that don't enjoy high-stress combat or those who aren't the best at this genre, especially since there's no way (that I know of) to gauge an enemy's skill or level. it's really disheartening to be punished with death when you're still learning."", 'It is too hard it is only my second day playing the game and i am already on my 19th try. Reason is everytime i need armor there are none and i encounter either wolves,bears,deserters,cultists, and bandits every five tiles even though i have the trait Menacing Aura. Also when i was playing in one of the encounters even though all of my party members had decent equipment 2 of my 3 party members still died so i was forced to start a new one.', ""Great game, pretty relaxed. I first played this game months ago, came back and it's improved hugely, I like the new health bar system, the optional challenges etc. There's clearly been a lot of effort and passion in this game, storytelling is great too! My favourite aspect is the level of customisation and also how your different squad members have different abilities and weapons can be purchased. I have a character who has knowledge with foraging etc uses less supplies amongst other traits!"", ""An amazing homage to old RPGs! I binged it for longer than I'd like to say when I opened it the first time. Theres too many idle clickers on mobile nowadays, so something like this sarasfies a craving haha. Please, please, PLEASE keep working on this game. Combat is very simple but still very good, the map could use more secret landmarks but travel has a good balanve with the ration system. I'd like more ways to increase the resolve of my party, maybe drinking at the tavern."", 'Great game. I love the concept and easy to master combat.theres just two things i would change....there needs someway to increase the chances of a member surviving lethal hits and just force them into retirement early.And there needs to be more ways of increasing resolve, perhap flawless victories and exploring should factor into the resolve as well.', 'An amazing game! There is nothing to hold you back on your adventure, the battle system is simple but fun, i only have one problem, sometimes i go all the way around the map but i can find no quests! You need quests in order to get supplies so it makes it really difficult ro play the game sometimes', ""Great game with a nostalgic feel. I like the exploration and the combat system. It's perfect for a mobile game. You're also not constantly blasted with ads which means you can focus more on the game without distractions. I look forward to more updates and more story progression."", ""Changed my all in all review, I was ecstatic when the damage are beginning to become chances of hits and how well the defenses are on one of your heroes, this was game changing, and I'd like to say again, this is a great game, I once had completed every path and ventured every corner, only reseting after a fellow party member died, I played that save for 6 hours, and it hurts to lose a member from the beginning"", ""Great game, takes a bit of work to master the battles but a few tips are. Get beside archers, they can't hit adjacent hexes. Keep back especially in tighter maps. Keep DuGrier alive, he's the 5th beatle. Put members with turn skipping to the front. Stops others advancing beyond them. Check out reddit for more tips. Have scored 100% last 2 games. More content would be very welcome."", ""I've been playing off and on for about 2 years. When the health bars were first introduced I was disappointed. But now I've realized that it was necessary to build in the leveling system which added so much more depth and immersion into the game. Overall I love the game and just want to see more, maybe new worlds or characters or weapons."", ""Difficulty is good only if it makes sense. Taking away the ability to skip a turn on a turn based game is just. Manufactured difficulty combined with stupidity. It makes no sense. Secondly being forced to command pointless npc escorts is also pointless. They will never see combat unless I rush then in. And again, no skip, so I'm forced to rock them back and forth in a corner. The games only strategy is unit placement and only one unit has any finnese. The rest just. Stand and trade punches."", 'Surprisingly engaging game. I would love to see that with some multiplayer capabilities! Edit: I like the lastest update, but it looks offscreen on my new Samsung A80 since it is widescreen and also crashed one time. Edit2: Thanks for fast respond! Yeah I guess it is pain to check for such devices.', ""I get that it's a small studio. but I didn't get a chance to leave the first city before an ad. Unacceptable... Never force ads. If the game is good, I'll watch ads for bonuses. Too bad, I might have enjoyed this game. after reply review: making me watch an ad before is too much trouble. how do I know there are no more ads in the future? a bit of a passive aggressive response from the dev there...""]"

If you click on the magnifying glass at the top you can see a description of anything. My only complaint is the placement of the consumable items because I will accidentally click them instead of the ability. You can buy morale, but it is NOT in your face. You can do everything in the game without microtransactions, and it does not feel like a grind.', ""Everything you could possibly expect out of a game like Cardinal Quest!!! Absolutely no paywall, everything can be unlocked by just enjoying the content, each area is procedurally generated (new layout each time), 3 difficulty settings to satiate every type of gamer, turn-based play that doesn't rush you at all, and very very easy on the battery! Most games on the app store barely make it 2 days on my phone. I keep coming back to this one anytime I need to pass some time on my phone. 6 stars!"", ""A free game that's extremely fun and doesn't expect you to pay for the other half of the game is rare to see. But one down side,the controls could be better but for a great game I'll accept."", 'Easy to pick up and play with everything explained. Other rogue like games can be a bit overwhelming and unclear on mechanics. Good game with plenty of skills and enchantments and variety to keep you interested', ""I don't care how many times I play this, I always come back for more. Definitely starts as a beginner's roguelike, the difficulty can get pretty unforgiving. It's rogue-lite elements give it more replayability, IMO, and a way for the less-hardcore-gamers among us a way unlock, not only small advantages, which can make all the difference, but entirely new classes, all of which present entirely new gameplay approaches."", 'Great game, keeping me entertained for hours. Sometimes the character moves in a direction I did not want, clearer guidance as to where to tap would be good.', 'The music sets a great ambiance, it reminds me of an old school dungeon crawler. Good job guys.', ""Great game! Doesn't pressure you to spend money, quite rare nowadays. Well made, simple yet very enjoyable. Items are useful and there are enough to satisfy a long time gamer. DL the game and give it a tried. I promise you won't be disappointed! I rate this a 5 stars! Game of the year for sure!"", ""CQ2 is a truly fun and efficient experience. It easily tops your typical hi-res, over-developed mobile game. Thank you for this solid product. I'm also a fan of Dead Shell ;)"", ""A good idea hampered by bad controls and unfair difficulty. So many times I tap to attack but wait a turn instead because I'm one pixel off. I got to the 3rd or 4th stage and all of a sudden I'm missing 90 percent of my attacks, enemies are invisible and take way more damage. It feels like a difficulty wall to make me stump up the cash to continue."", 'I really would give 5, if only control wasn\'t retarded to the level, where common thing is to ""wait"" near the enemy regardless of struggle to click area with him. It is really strange that game with such a controll gets 4.8 rating. It even got ridiciolous 4.1 rating of controll, when it deserves no more than 1 star. Overall really nice game destroyed by simple, fundamental flaw, which strangely still wasn\'t repaired.', ""Great rogue like game. Takes a bit of practice to learn the mechanics, but it's a fun way to pass the time."", 'You know, first going into the game, I only expected it to be a small time killer, but the variety of skills you can learn as well as items you can collect makes it more of a tactical rpg other than relying heavily on rng, making this game more fun the more you learn about it. Pretty great find', 'This game have been the best game I have played so far and I felt that something is missing, so I am asking for you developers that if you can\'t add more items, equipments, Acts, or hero, can you atleast create ""cardinal quest 3"" with new acts and new enemies with new story line to give us the best experience when we play this again so thank you for this wonderful game.', 'Brilliant game, played it for a few days solid. No advertisements and the paid content (only 1 class) I unlocked just by playing. Cleared act 1 with all classes and enjoyed clearing the other acts with most of them. Will try completionist this one', 'Fantastic. No pay to win. Great fun. Missed my stop on the tube more than once due to being to into the game.', 'Wow... I usually give some advices, here i can say nothing. Absolutely perfect gameplay, i already finished COTND on switch and few more similar here in play store, but this is by far the most complete and enjoyable. +3 buffed dog is op, but i would leave it this way because cuteness should always be op :)', 'Honestly a gem of a game, no need to pay and the mechanics are amazing, work of art for a mobile game!', 'Good game, fun to play, there are in app purchases but they are really unobtrusive.', ""Properly exceptional old school top down dungeon crawling Roguelike deliciousness. And its genuinely Free To Play. I haven't even seen a way to give these boys money. But I definitely will. Look at how long this review is. Gaze upon its turgid character count. Preposterous. This game is really that good."", 'Actual gameplay is okay, but controls and user interface are terrible. Tapping an enemy next to you to attack it and having the game registering it as tapping yourself will make you wait a turn while getting hit. This happens often and is frustrating. When you pick up a consumable, you cannot check what it does. Clicking on it once will consume it automatically. There\'s supposed to be a ""skill tree"" but the skills have one word descriptions so you don\'t know what you\'re actually leveling up.', ""Add more gear dedicated to the class please. It's really easy to target and piss off the scavenger with ranged weapons, is that neccesary because it is annoying. Fun game but it's gotten somewhat boring pretty quickly as all gear and spells seem to available to all classes."", ""Excellent game. One of those that feels wrong to have gotten for free, it's so good. The combat is intuitive and rewards creative thinking, the narrative is engaging, and the music is great."", 'Great app! Gameplay is fun and challenging. I really applaud the developers for not having advertisements in their game, level designs are interesting and there is a lot of replayability.', 'No ads, well placed comedy (using the book item while playing as a Pugilist made me laugh SO HARD! XD), so many items and abilities to make every experience different from the last and a amazing challenge to play and finish! Love playing it! ♥️', 'Simple and fun game for mobile. I liked the idea that you always need to make a choice between items and skills: either keep or trash. Had fun for around three days.

I think they should make those the default controls to avoid those complaints.', ""Captivating turn based rogue like RPG. Once you install and try It out, you'll lose many hours by playing the game."", 'Cardinal Quest is a classic. One of my alltime favorites.

You are an astronaut awaking from cryonics not in the solar system, but... out there... in a far and unknown place of the galaxy. In Out There, you will have to survive, tinkering your ship with what you can gather drifting in the void, and spot garden planets to refill your oxygen supply. 

Space is an hostile place ; dangerous and mysterious adventures will mark each step of your travel. You will not only meet intelligent species that won’t care about you, but also deal with ancient powers linked to your destiny and the fate of mankind itself.

This is a perfect middle ground for complexity really, a 12 year old should be able to understand this easily. I really like this game actually, I for my part have my derelicts enabled in settings, haven\'t found any yet but surely in the future i will find one, am interested to see what it says about it when it happens.  for some reason fuel seems to be on the inner planets closer to the supernovas (sun) and metals further away when in truth the heat of the supernova would burn the gases off, but it is a video game.. as far as a story and all I have to admit I have enjoyed the bit of this I have played. I have been looking at this title for a longtime and been unsure about it for a longtime, I am glad I finally picked it up, now if google would stop removing stuff from our accounts after we pay for them it will be all good, but you know how it is, Esau is ALWAYS busy.', ""It's a good fun game but it has issues.

No stupid action sequences, no finicky controls, just you and a deep system of mechanics to explore.

Enjoy the atmosphere. Embrace the challenge. Die alone. Learn from your mistakes. Repeat. Decent port of a cool little game, but achievements seem to be broken. No big deal--just an observation. See you Out There.', ""Don't get me wrong, I love this game. I am just so upset that the ACHIEVEMENTS DON'T WORK, especially after finishing the most difficult ending and realizing that fact. Once that small issue is addressed, then this will be a 5 star review instead. The music is great, the story is interesting and enigmatic. I would still suggest buying this game, for sure."", ""I don't usually go for mobile games, but this one is really enjoyable. It has a loosely told story, though the real seller is the survival. It can be frustrating to see about 2 hours, and 60 star systems worth of progress end because of chance, but that's part of the game, though It is still doable. The music and art style is really well done, and sets a haunting tone for the game. It's not action based, but if you don't mind a slow burn and a challenge, you'll enjoy it."", 'Really fun Sci Fi survival game. It actually feels like a light weight FTL, in the sense that you jump from star to star accumulating resources to reach the end game. You find things like technology, discover the language of the gods, and find derelict ships you can take over (including all your own lost ships). It is fun, but can sometimes feel like a pure game of chance.', 'In short this is a dark, story driven adventure game with a heavy emphasis on resource management. Of the few dozen games Ive played on Mobile, this is my favorite. Its not a free game but it is worth the money. No microtransactions or ""pay to win"" type gameplay. Its a complete game with several endings depending on the path you choose. The galaxy is randomly generated each time, which makes some sessions harder than others depending on the hand you get dealt.', 'Loved Out There for its great story, beautiful visuals, and peak roguelike mechanics. Got a new phone (Samsung Galaxy S10+) and now it freezes on the homescreen. Unfortunate for how much I want to keep playing this.']"

- Fancy control scheme with no virtual buttons or sticks to fumble over.
- Unlock new areas, for increasingly punishing difficulty.
- 13 area types, all with different monsters, potential traps, and rare encounters.

The game play is fun and well balanced, if you're focused and paying attention, you'll do well, but it's still hectic enough to feel rogue like and chaotic! I highly recommend, definitely worth the time and money."", ""I understand that some folks enjoy pixel art games, but I'm not a fan of retro chic. I've found a few exceptions (usually not overly pixelated), but this game isn't one of them. There are so few pixels in use that I couldn't tell what I was looking at most of the time. Did I pick up a map? Or is it a candle? Or a small zombie? Is this a trail to follow, or is it a bush that will block me? Sound is great, animation is smooth, and it's obviously made with love. 4* but sorry I couldn't enjoy it."", ""I'm enjoying the game, perhaps the most entertaining RPG dungeon crawler on android. Easy to pick up with great controls, there's never a dull moment in this game unlike other RPGs which tend to get boring in the early stages. Definitely worth every penny. I highly recommend!"", 'This is one of my favorite phone games of all time. Its feel is sort of like classic 2d zelda mixed with dark souls, really getting to know each character and how to fight is a really rewarding experience and each playthrough of a level is unique enough that I keep finding new events, hidden boss fights and pieces of lore even after playing a level a dozen times. No microtransactions, and unlocking new content through your actual gameplay and achievements feels so satisfying! Highly recommend.', ""This game is awesome. Only problem is, sometimes it requires me to go into the Play store just to validate the game, and if I don't do this, it doesn't allow me to play the game! What the hell did I pay for? I bought the game already! Please update this game to solve this issue."", 'Great, challenging, and amusing. A very challenging Zelda/gauntlet style game. Each enemy class requires different strategies, and the controls are excellent. This isn\'t simply a ""blast your way through"" game. There are randomized story encounters that add nice backstory flavors.', ""Noodlecake releases yet another satisfying game. Lots of replay value like they say and it's easy to pick up. You're not just going to be standing there swinging or slinging, you actually have to try. The music is chill making the whole experience relaxing while still fun."", ""This game deserves more praise. Its a perfect mobile experience. The controls I honestly feel are top notch and I wouldn't want them any different.Each character plays very differently this allows any persons style type to find a character they like. I hope to see more from this company in games like this. I'm sick of being robbed from f2p games and refuse to play them again. When I saw this game It brought me back to when I played older games on old consoles. Times when skills were key to win"", 'I\'ve installed the game a second time to see if it would run and it runs! Good thing, too. The game is fantastic! It\'s a progressive rogue-like in the sense that death is death, but you get some things carry over to your next run. The controls are tight, the music is good, and the gameplay loop provides that addictive ""one more time"" sensation. Excellent game!', 'good time killer, my only wish it that it had a cloud save feature so i didn\'t have to start over completely if i switch devices or factory reset one, thats all ti is really missing. The second update section mentions the same thing but that was a year ago and it isn\'t there yet.. Edit:Still no cloudsave? You gotta be kidding.. so planned ""second update"" will be never right?', ""It's fun up until you get to the catacombs, it's almost as if that level isnt meant to be beat.

I miss off axis of my attacks so awkwardly it just pisses me off, otherwise very good game.', 'The touchscreen controls for this absolutely skill based arcade style dungeon fighter are flawless. The game is quite difficult, and replay value is there just learning how to fight with each character and finding solid strategies against each enemy. I highly recommend the game.', ""Game overall is fun but could use some tweaks. I like the movement, but the ability actions are lacking and I almost wish there were buttons instead of the swipes. Also, the dungeons textures can be very similar to one another and make it difficult navigating at times. Worth playing, it's fun"", ""Game's great! Only problem is if I exit the app and try to re-enter all I get is a black screen."", 'It was like installing a virus on my Samsung 10e.

Hard and random.', ""Its awesome with only one problem. its crashed for several times now which is annoying sometimes even in the mos inconvenient time like when im doing good against amaranth with great scrolls and full health i managed to damage him quite a bit and it crashed. but one time it does one thing good. im at tower floor 6 and it crashed. im pissed but when i reload the game it says i unlocked spellsword which ive been trying to inlock.. and there he is unlocked without clearing the tower yet.. he's my favorite. if you fix the crashing issue that would be much appreciated. thanks a lot."", 'Very hard game , fun , not too much in depth like a light rogue dungeon .', ""The music is so good, that I sleep to the soundtrack every night. The gameplay is challenging, fun and unique for each character. The story is fun. You will die. A lot. But when you finally best that person who's killed you 12 times, it is the best feeling. I already bought and played many hours of this game on iOS. I bought it for this because it is a necessity in my life."", 'Broken. Infinite spinning circle on the logo screen. Even on a Pixel 3.', 'Charming graphics, ""ok"" story, varied classes/characters (different gameplay style and tactics), good amount of enemies, nice ambience and soundtrack. The upgrades are too expensive: it takes A LOT of time to get the required gold to get all of them for a SINGLE character. Also, most of them don\'t make much of a difference. Some forge upgrades are very lackluster. The game is hard and punishing. It has been too long since the ""next"" update has been announced.', 'Graphics are great and has good pixel art. Gameplay is simple but fun although one thing just bugs me alot. HOW. ON. EARTH. DO YOU EVEN REGAIN HEALTH?', ""Game doesn't work when trying to load my game profile, if I play not signed in it works fine."", ""It starts off great, but the later levels get incredibly grindy and unfun. The floor count increases for some reason, artificially inflating the rewards from your runs. Some enemies will actively run away from you to poke and attack when it's least convenient, losing precious hp. The only reliable source of regaining hp is by leaving the floor, which forces you to skip out on loot or secrets, and you can't go back up. Random item drops are too rare, making you conserve what you have too much."", 'Pretty damn good. Made me care about the characters, regardless of their cardboard cutout nature.

I ALSO LOVE THE FACT THIS GAME HAS NO ADDS AND CAN BE PLAYED OFFLINE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!', ""Bought this game for the SECOND time because I switched from iPhone to Android but unfortunately the game does not fit to my Pixel XL's screen correctly.

TBH I'd think this game would be really nice on the Nintendo switch"", ""Doesn't start in Android 10. Seems to have been abandoned by the devs."", ""I'm not sure how I feel about this game. Sometimes I love it, sometimes it just feels meh. The graphics are awesome and the controls are pretty smooth, but sometimes there's too much going on and it can be confusing. I do enjoy the game though, and works great with a controller."", 'Fun game, but it crashes too often.', ""No notch support, the game is also very unstable. They just need to update this game already... it's been abandoned now for months."", ""The xp system is dumb. The upgrades are all terrible unless you keep farming the dungeon again and again..... I admire their no IAP policy but forcing player to waste so much time isn't fun either... Why couldn't the upgrades be better or cost less coins?

The game is fun to play it's just a shame I can't play it on my tablet. I would rate it a five if not for this issue."", 'The game was alright. Basically just a hack and slash. I like that you have the ability to build your character stats any way you like, but with the game being so short and shallow there really isnt any advantage to building a character thats not just a straight forward fighter', ""This is a game that reminds me of titles such as Neverwinter Nights and other RPGs of that era. A story driven game with fun quests that quite often have lots of different possible outcomes depending on your choices. This is the kind of game you would expect to play on a PC a few years ago. The graphics still look good despite the fact that the game isn' t brand new. The story, dialogues, choices and RPG elements are solid and create a very pleasant and imersive experience."", ""The game itself is well worth the price. If it feels *short* to anyone, it's coz they're comparing it with PC games. Most of all, the conversations and music set up a better ambience than I had dared to hope for. All in all, I had a good time! P.S. Please roll out the next part(s), the story is very engaging!"", 'Long and quite funning easily 5 to 6 hour game. It is better than most rpgs on the store.', 'One of the best games available on Android. Well worth the buy and much more.', ""love this game, when is the sequel ? because I would definitely be hooked on a franchise like this. I won't spoil the story but I will say it's a lot of fun playing it, and rightly so as you can tell there's been a lot of time invested into this game that its easy for players to really get engulfed into it's story. It's so rare to find a good rpg to play on the go, so I would definitely recommend this one as it is an absolute stand out in the market."", ""I'm currently playing Darkness over Daggerford module for Neverwinter Nights EE, and as it got me intrigued, I just realized that this is made by the same guys who made this game! And surprisingly enough, I played The Shadow Sun before their other works. Compared to Darkness over Daggerford, I'd say this game doesn't have much love put into it.

Looks nice, has decent if generic RPG elements and makes for a good mobile game. However it desperately needs controller support for people who use Android consoles or controller attachments.  Most big games support controllers (GTA series, Ravensword, Quake etc.) so this is an oversight on the developers' part and the reason I rated it only 3 stars. What's the point in making a good game if you're going to gimp it with touch controls?"", ""This is a mobile game?  It was such a blast that it got me away from my computer.  Excellent pacing, balanced character development, story, originality.  It's hard to believe this game isn't for the pc (coming from a die hard pc fanboy).

Excluding the lack of controller support the Shadow Sun is a perfect game, better than KOTOR, and I highly recommend it."", 'The game is great and huge with lots of things to do and interesting conversations. It is definitely worth the price. However, having just changed phones, I realised it does not have cloud saves.

It will be more than welcome. :)', 'This is an amazing game. I opened to play it not expecting much despite the reviews, but found myself an hour and half in and not wanting to put it down. What a gem of a game. The only gripe I have is that the controls are a bit on the finicky side, but not a game killer - that is they just take a bit to get used to. Well worth the 2.99 asking price. I purchased it through the Google opinion rewards, so not a big deal and once again, well worth it. Good job developer!', 'A very good born-mobile game in the tradition of Neverwinter Nights or Knights of the Old Republic, but with a unique (Dark-Sun-inflected) fantasy setting. The score is fantastic, the writing fine, and the character customization a nice balance of old-school detail with few enough options to make most skills seem distinct and worthwhile. Combat is passable but not too annoying.  Very enjoyable overall package.', 'I LOVE this game, can you pls and more stuff to the warrior starter pack because theirs no exclusive weapon to start out with.

No need to cheat. Smooth every step of the way', ""What an amazing way to ask for a review! I know this game is rather old but I've been going thru the Asdivine games chronologically and they do not disappoint.

Storyline is phenomenal and gameplay is an improvement over its predecessor.', ""It's a fine game l guess."", ""Let's run through the categories one by one: The graphics are very detailed and they evoke that old-school JRPG feel. 8/10. I like the sound for the most part, but the battle themes are a little too rock-ish to fit entirely in this setting. Also, characters are only voiced in battles. 8/10. The character types and their interactions are fairly entertaining, but nothing that really grips me yet. 5/10, subject to change.

That was a really nice way to bring your players to review - same goes for the other games. I think it's one of the best KEMCO games there is. Athough, there are some typos and such. Periods and a few sentences which are hard to understand. The story plot is really great, although, it could be a bit confusing. As to why and when Izayoi has lost his power.

Imagine my disappointment when I realized that all of my in-game purchases (the gameroom items, classes, etc.) not only have to be re-purchased, but now cost diamonds instead of gold (which, at this point in my playthrough, I\'ve found no way of earning diamonds) which severely limits gameplay options. May not be installed long', ""I absolutely love what they are trying to do here, unfortunately the execution sucks, especially in regards to the monetization of the game.

Don't waste your time, it'll all be for nothing. Just play real D&D instead."", ""This is what you should expect from Paradox, I know as a registered Stellaris player. They make a good, finished game but decide to chop it to pieces in order to make it cost YOU more as a consumer. There's virtually no way to earn gems to unlock or buy anything at a decent pace which is my biggest gripe; if I could watch ads back to back for unlocks, I'd reconsider playing. In summary, I'd enjoy it as a pixel game if I didn't have to buy anything because it's moronic to buy pixels."", 'I paid for the full version (&DLC) years ago. The fact that Paradox Interactive is so greedy to change this to a freemium game, DELETE ALL OF OUR SAVES that I personally spent 20+ hours on, and then just compensate with in game currency that I would never have paid for in the first place, and then trying to force us to pay for more with in-game prompts is ridiculous.

Its one of those games that you have to farm-play to get the cool gear, also its ONLY worth to buy the extra stories and characters because they are really fun!

I've supposedly unlocked several recipes through investigation (in fact, I've completed all investigations on the main map), but none of them appear on my recipe list. Other minor gripes include the slightly inconvenient dungeon navigation system and traditional RPG fiddly inventory micromanagement. Otherwise this would be 5 stars."", 'This game is full of bugs. Having looked up those bugs for solutions, the reason becomes clear. A new developer who is hell-bent on getting every cent from the game and locking up parts behind paywalls, making things grindier just to convince people to pay more... a decent developer would have added new content, bug fixes or quality of life improvements. Sadly, paradox entertaintment is not one of those.', 'I loved KoPaP 1, and I loved this one as well. I happily bought the game and its expansions and played through the majority of it. After a few months I decided to play the game again,only to find my save deleted, and the entire game reworked into a free to play shitshow. It was a fun d and d esque game that harkened back to old rpgs. Now it is inflated to make the gold grind harder and less fun. The new version is in every way worse, and they have given no way to access the game I paid money for', ""The game is fun for sure. Very nostalgic. However because it's a free game everything costs way to much in game currency. There is a point when it's hard to progress without a brutal grind or paying for resources. I'll probably buy the full version on xbox as far as I know it doesn't have all the extra gold costs."", ""SO...pay for the full version. On PC. They hit you hard with the grind on any of their freemium versions, give you jack all for premium currency outside of spending money to unlock content and for any free players, gold is scarce. So much so you're better off just buying the full versions off mobile devices and restarting your account/playthrough. Yes, free to play versions of their games are THAT bad."", ""Started out fun, as most free games do, but soon turns into a slow grind for gold to buy over priced gear. And even if your the same level as a standard monster one crit can kill you out right costing a large chunk of the gold you've been saving to up to buy gear. I can easily overlook micro transactions if the game is enjoyable but this thing went straight for the cash grab."", 'The game can be fun, but the only way to have any fun is either pay a lot of money or endlessly grind on easy monsters. To high a barrier to entry to try and like a game. You cant afford anything with buying in game currency yourself, the enemy crit ratios are to high, and some quests you cant do even if your overleveled. Again it can be fun but youll be gring yourself to death to reach that point.', ""Total cash grab! Got this game and was hoping the in app purchases wouldn't mess the balance up but its awful. Absolutely everything in this game is designed to get people to spend real money. You'll be outmached by every enemy within an hour. One hit kills are standard and it costs money to resurrect characters. Could have been great with a flat price and proper balancing but greed is king I suppose."", ""Great game I really love it but I recently lost a valuable item somehow to a glitch when swapping gear around other than that I would have given 5 stars. Okay guys seriously I replace an old weapons. With a new one and my old weapon disappears this is the second time this happened and I'm so pissed I lost the turrasqe claw and that was only available to obtain once and now it's lost forever really starting to dislike and that sucks cause I loved it so much I actually spent money on this game."", 'For as fun of an idle game as it is, it constantly infuriates the player with inaccurate stats. My character with lowest threat is recieving more attention than everyone else. This particular mechanic wrecks the game every time I play it, with my weakest zero threat character being the first target at best 1/3 of the time with three characters. Most of the time it just gets hit keeps getting hit back to back until it dies. Is the DM metagaming the encounters?', ""If you don't play right you get punished way to hard by making that the enemy's level there damage more then you can defend. And it's not hinted at at all that you are doing so. After sometime playing, that damage of the enemy's gets to a critical point and you are practically soft lock. Or if you want to farm low level enemy's for a very long time, you can escape it. But it's not fun.! All wen you know about it, it becomes rather fun game"", ""Pros: Pretty fun turn based rpg. Simple, yet engaging. Animation is cool. Seemed like the items were gonna get pretty good. Cons: That grind wall around level 13. That's it. Once you get there, it seems like if you don't drop irl money, you'll be spending hours upon hours grinding up xp."", ""Great game but unbalanced to the point of being a money grab. The gold prices for gear and items need to come down. Gems need to be rewarded more often. I need to at least feel like if I put in enough time I can eventually buy something with the coins and gems. Time=ads=$$$. And right now, I've stopped playing because the grind feels pointless. As a note, I found this game on Steam and bought it. It is So. Much. Better. Its balanced and makes me miss D&D. Please add more DLC."", ""Honestly a fun ride until you get a bit in. This edition has insane scaling Resurrection costs, and no way to rez party members without spending a disproportionate amount of gold that you can't farm because your characters are dead. If you want to continue, you have to spend gold to go to a town, and more to travel BACK. The RNG is out of control, honestly compared to the first one or an actual game of DnD. Basically it's designed to make you buy gems. All the content is expensive as well."", ""The game is ok, constant grind if you dont want to spend money, not bad to fill in time. The biggest issue with this game is the imbalance in combat. Yes i get a critical can do a lot of damage the fact that you will just randomly get killed in 1 hit by a monster 3 levels lower then you is not right, especially when it's a barbarian or paladin at full health. Huge cost of resurrection is another issue that needs looking at."", 'I absolutely adore KoP&P2 on the PC, so I was excited to see a mobile port of the game. Unfortunately, fhis mobile port is yet another shameless cash grab in an effort to squeeze money out of people. Everything costs way more money, enemies are more difficult, drop rate is severely reduced, and extra content is locked behind a pay wall that ends up costing MUCH more money than just buying the PC version. The core gameplay is great, but I would have rather paid 10 dollars to get a true port.', 'Stupid and broken. The table top rpg game that dorsnt understand percentage chances and kill your characters off so you spend money. My ninja who has 2 threat aka a 0% vhance of getting attacked is crit hit 8 times in a row instead of my warrior or my paladin who both have 58% and 42%. Also said ninja has 20 crit and has not crit once since i got him but has died by ""random"" crits from enemies. Tldr game forces units to die so you spend money on gold to get them back.', ""This game used to be incredible. I spent hours on it and couldn't peel myself away. After I exhausted all the content, I deleted it. I redownloaded it recently only to be massively disappointed. The commentary is still super witty, but the gameplay is a slog now. The monetization hurt this game a lot (and possibly other gameplay changes slowing down the game). It's simply not fun anymore."", 'Knights of Pen & Paper has so much promise, but cannot escape the fact that it just wants your money. Whether you are a fan of tabletop RPGs or not, there is a lot of fun to be had here. However, it is chalk full of microtransactions. Farming gold is slow, and everytime a character dies your only options are to pay gold or experience to revive them. Worse, the cost of revival goes up every time. If you wanted some money for your trouble, you should just charge for the app. Good, but Greedy.', ""The game itself is fine and enjoyable, BUT the cost to enjoy the entire game is ludicrous. The cost to unlock all characters, classes, and adventures is $70. That doesn't include the upgrades that you can get to make your party stronger. The cost of getting and upgrading all of those are at least $650! These aren't silly cosmetic things, these are actual game altering purchases. You CAN get free premium currency, but only $0.025 at a time EVERY FEW DAYS. I suggest that you skip this game."", ""The game is alright, though I feel as if it's not properly balanced. I can go into a quest two levels below me, and have my ass kicked by enemies who get constant critical hits and deal massive damage, plus a condition. I barely get any decent gear for my level, either. But my biggest complaint is that I've opened my chests, two free and one of the 175 diamond ones that guarantee a legendary, and got none of my items because I didn't know opening them in the menu sends them to oblivion."", ""to be fair I'm not that far into the game but I have both of my characters at level 12 but there's no way to get the supposed other three characters that are shown the pictures and video of this game. It's basically false advertising when there's only two playable Adventures, instead of 5."", ""Honestly, this game is amazing! I'm a huge rpg player and I love the feeling that I'm in the party as a player as well as the Dungeon Master. Personally I enjoy the grinding to get stronger, it adds a nice touch. The pay to be stronger method on the other hand I don't like, because other players can just buy gems to get way stronger than they need to just so they can be better. I really love this game and I would highly recommend playing it, I would love to see more of this in the future."", ""Very fun, gems are needed to buy expansions, but worth it from what I hear. No paywalls (I've beat the core campaign), so no microtransactions necessary, unless you want the expansions. That said, the game is so enjoyable I bought some gems just because I was already having so much fun, and wanted to support it while gaining the in-game benefits"", ""Graphics are nice, the game is free, and that's about the limit of nice things to say. Prices of items and services are crazy high, and with major gold sinks from resurrections, investigations, equipment upgrades, it feels very strongly of deliberately frustrating design to incentivize microtransactions. One can only buy game room gear via premium currency. Death is frequent and expensive. Both the original Knights of the Pen and Paper & Galaxy of Pen and Paper are better games."", 'Great concept, but the game is grindy as hell. You wanna resurrect your characters? Sure, just grind for gold for the next 15 minutes. Oh, one of your characters died in the process? Too bad. Level scaling is pretty much non-existent, stuff is insanely costly and the overall experience is horrible and a pure grindfest after the first dungeon.', ""A great game ruined by bad microtransactions and a lot of gold farming. Everything costs more gold than it should. New area? 100g. Weapons that actually do damage? 700 to 5000g. Character died? 450g. This wouldn't be such a big deal if battles gave you enough gold to survive, but instead a battle may get you around 35g and a tiny bit of EXP. You can avoid this with diamonds, which you can get with real money. But you want enough diamonds to unlock a new class? That'll be $10 minimum."", 'The other version of kights of pen and paper is much better. I payed for the special characters in this version and when I came back all of my progress got removed and I have to pay for the characters again. I wish it would have saved my purchases at least because everytime I try to restore my purchase nothing happens. Whatever you do, do not spend money on this game', ""I was willing to overlook the microtransactions, which you pretty much have to do to get anywhere. But then, the final boss. This is practically unbeatable. The final boss goes first almost every time, and immediately kills one of your characters. Tl:dr The game almost forces the microtransactions, and the boss is practically unbeatable. Don't waste your time, or money. I spent about $50 to be greatly disappointed."", ""I remember when the unlockable content was free. I even made a Paradox to keep my data. However, premium purchases do not count if they were unlocked for free, thus corrupting your previous save data on the cloud. Others have also brought up the issue with their save data and you have done nothing about it. Like you want people to pay for what they already had. Doesn't make it any better when the only free gems you give aren't useful. Just . . . Uninstall it everyone. I beat it already anyways."", 'Looked like a fun game and I did enjoy it to begin with but it got to a point at level 10 where my guys (apart from 1) was at the correct level and enemys started 1 or 2 shoting me, not enough rewards are given to make grinding fun, dungeon dont seem to offer rest points so even if I can deal with the enemys il just run out of health and magic, only consumables found drained all magic, too much reliance of having gems to get gold needed to play this and have fun and items are way t0o expensive', ""Loved the story, progression and character race/class and skills management. I would love to see skins or other ways to visually customize your character. The art style, dialogs and descriptions are pretty nice. Items are balanced and there's a daily dungeon that gives some juicy drops. What i didn't like is that dungeons not only progressively increase their difficulty, but they also increase their floor and rooms-per-floor number, which make them, in my humble opinion, unnecesarily harder."", ""A fun game to play, but the in game economy is horrible. You can buy an item in the wrong place for 48,000 and then sell it for a measly 300. The quest rewards don't scale well AT ALL. A level 18 quest gave me a dagger, something you can get easily at level 1. In app purchases are ludicrous. Everything is upwards of $10 for something it takes you nothing to create. Just another game that doesn't understand the word MICROtransaction. There's more issues but I ran out of space."", ""It's a great game, it really is. But it only wants your money now. I remember playing this back when, and I loved it so much! I redownloaded recently and what I found was an awful monstrosity of microtransactions and the game begging you for money. If you want money, just make people have an option to watch an ad for extra stuff, like everyone else. You used to be good, but now you're a disappointment.""]"

Additionally, it doesn\'t work very well - rather than a gradual increase in difficulty, at some point the game seems to decide ""that\'s enough"", and (wherever you are, whatever you are doing) spams you with enemies until you die. that\'s not a game - you may as well just watch a sand timer run out.', 'This is a brilliant early 1990s RPG. It is well written. Nothing breaks. If you live to parse rules and/or treaties, then track commodities on a spreadsheet. This is YOUR game. The game will slowly kill your character.

Controls are a bit awkward, and it can be a challenge to get all the info you need. Not sure how it feels at higher difficulty levels yet.', ""As a pragmatic software engineer, I deem this game to have very serious game-design problems. - Popups come and go so quickly that I struggle to read them before they vanish. - On the world map's help, it does not show faction icons in the help, or planet names by the planets. - It is unusual when I know which action causes a loss in faction reputation (this might be exacerbated by the problem of not being able to read the popups) Fix these issues and I'll adjust my review."", ""on the surface it seems pretty hard to get into but once you understand how the system works it a lot like Tradewinds or any other resources hunting and trading game. it's fun, I got in on sale and never looked back, I even got the pilot and ship builder dlc because they do what good dlc should, add to the experience (and for a buck each who could complain, I totally paid for this game using Google opinion rewards)"", ""One of the few mobile games I can play open parentheses I'm blind close parenthesis. It's actually really fun and reminds me of Eve online"", ""I absolutely love this game for all the different things that you can do in it I wish that they would update it I know that they have a newer game but that one's junk comparison to this one I love having two different factions that I can work for everything is all right there it's easy to understand and very challenging if you need it to be been playing this game off and on for a few years now just really wish it would update this game it has a lot of potential"", ""It's a lot of fun. Big quadrant to explore. Write down where you hide valuables. They're easy to lose. Difficult game to play straight given all the faction conflicts. Combat is a little clunky, but even then it's interesting and provides room for different tactics."", 'May i suggest something ? I feel that this game is lacked something, do i play for reputation only, a bit dull, no meaning.

Like I said I've bought it twice."", ""good game. lots of options, lots of things to do. but too many texts and too much to read. would be great if there's a quick access to events, conflicts, and logs. overall good game"", 'Very difficult game unless you read every thing that is shown on the screen. Even then a lot of the game seems to be based on luck... I think the game is very complex and requires a much more in depth tutorial...', ""Good game to pass the time.

Removing features of a game i already paid for and locking em behind pay walls is ridiculous.', 'So random how much things are worth,and where the missions are sent too. often would get missions in the beginning that i had no hope of completing.

Some achievements don't unlock their rewards."", ""Honestly, there's not much to say. It's a better Star Traders RPG. The gameboard bigger but you don't have any extra time to compete quests. But, the quest rewards are bigger. Its a lot more cutthroat that way."", 'This is a great game. Plenty to do as a captain of a ship along with a large galaxy to explore.

This update also includes minor bug fixes.","[""Great, but not meant for large phones... So the game itself is the best quality of its peers that I have seen, and I have played a lot of them. The only problem I have with the game is that the screen doesn't fit! It's extremely awkward on larger phones as the game window only takes up a 2/3 of the screen. Now they have a stretch mode, but that sort of causes the text to become confusing and generally makes it glitchy in other ways. Fix that, and you'll have a loyal customer forever."", ""Hands down the best Pokemon-esque game on mobile. Creos look awesome, the element/evolution system is pretty good though I prefer the standard evolution mechanics that we're used to, I like the addition of healing moves and replacing pp with cooldowns and it doesn't force MTs down your throat. It has a few issues imo though. The ability bar looks old and out of place, only having 5 Creo with you at a time, the map is too small, the game is waaay too easy and it relies on status effects too much."", ""Could be fun but sadly ruined by greed/ gacha mechanics and some odd design choices. Catch rate is basically impossible for anything decent, forcing you to spend real money if you want good mons.. I wish they'd just increase the price of the game by a few bucks and get rid of the pay2win garbage. End game combat is anti-fun hax spam. Also ability descriptions are missing vital information so it's more of a guessing game than a strategy game."", ""Nothing special. There are too few things it does well compared to the cons. If you want an offline monster collecting rpg for a decent price, thats what you'll get. But expect to look up info on the game, because its as discriptive and insightful as pokemon red/blue."", ""This review is a long time coming. I was first introduced to EvoCreo on my OUYA. I was looking for a Pokemon-style game and this fit the bill perfectly. I also loved that I could play it on the big screen. Fast forward to today and the game is still wonderful. I am no longer able to play it on the big screen (no Android TV controller support) but the touch controls are easy to use on my phone. That's the 10k foot view from a dad. From my 11yo, she absolutely adores this game. She's a self-proclaimed Pokemon expert and I often find her coming back to EvoCreo as it does a number of things really well. First, the ability to see the strengths and weaknesses of each type simply by tapping on the Creo type while in battle. She finds that super useful. Second, she loves the variety of Creo. Third, the story is good and she feels like there's more to it than simply trying to become a champion. For me, the dad, I'd love to be able to play this on my tv again. It really is a wonderful game and we've enjoyed many many hours of playing it. Keep up the good work Ilmfinity and we're looking forward to EvoCreo 2!"", ""I've been looking for an alternative to Pokemon and a lot of the games out there on mobile advertise themselves as being similar but are actually pay to win. Evocreo is a full game with gameplay very similar to Pokemon. In some ways the mechanics are better. You can get healing moves like in standard JRPGs which make a massive difference and moves have to recharge so you can't spam the most powerful move. Overall it's a brilliant game with really creative monsters and mechanics."", 'I saw the trailer, looked interesting. So I paid the reasonable price, was hyped about the game. Played for 10 mins which turned into 3 hours later. This game is simple, addicting and beautifully done. Will definitely have to buy the extension packages.', ""Well, I really like! Tbh I prefer it over most Pokemon games. A lot of creo designs are really pretty and nifty looking as well, like Valnot and Furen. The world feels p full, not like how it is in BotW where everyone had a motive and life, but it still felt nice to read dialogue that made sense and was placed well. For improvement, I would suggested adding more. Add somethings for those of us who don't care about battles. Like maybe a pagent for creo? Or perhaps camping and things like that."", ""I love the game. I realy like the battle scenario when there's a different moves that can be used for each creo, so one creo will not use all its slot moves with all powerfull moves. It make the battle more exciting because u dont need to expect a creo use a powerfull moves constinously. I also love the storyline, i didnt expect the ending. Hope double battle will be add to Evocreo 2 and with more awesome storyline. Great job"", 'Honestly this is the best mobile game I have ever come across.Really does scratch that pokemon itch, no comparision..I would even go as far as sayin it beats the modern pokemon games on ""monster"" designs.. hands down..absolutly brilliant game, hours of content...My only gripe would be this, I am doing a second play through on a different phone than the first, and for this second playthrough, I keep getting game freezes, where i have to reload the game and loose all progress since my last save..', ""This is a great game! It isn't easy peasy like some other turn based monster games and has cool mechanics and I love how the game looks and artwork of the creo. This is by far the best monster turn based game. I can't wait for evocreo 2 as they said will come out in a year or two."", ""I usually don't buy apps and games, but having tried the lite version, I was really impressed. This game is way better than Pokemon. The sprites, music, battle system were excellent. Wish if the game was a bit longer. I'm looking forward to play evocreo 2, when it gets released."", ""Tbh, probably the best Pokemon fan type game I've played though the thing with Google + being shut down doesn't let multiplayer work or even other saves. Probably should use other accounts such as Facebook or Instagram if possible. Sadly I wish I could play with my friends for I love this game"", 'This is an excellent game, whilst it does have slight bugs, its much better than pokemon in terms of designs of the creo and the types and battling mechanics. However one thing I would like to see in the new games is similar to something that is in pokemon SwSh where there is a wild area, not like the park but with different areas of snow desert, furthermore more developed towns like the final city in Evocreo. I love the inclusion of the creo that can evolve into many different types like naja.', ""Only issue I'm having is accessing the storage for my creos it just goes to a black screen and I can still here the music playing in the background other than that issue it's a wonderful game to play with the graphics and controls if the issue gets fixed I'd give it 5*"", 'For me i gave it a 4-star because the game is really beautiful and all but the in app purchase is a bit expensive i really really love the animation and for me it surpasses the GBA pokemon Games because the story is long and understanding so that is it', ""The game are very addicting but after finishing the game you will get bored because your enemies are still the same and also when you're catching creos. The man in Hydro City is right. Wish you'll add something special to the game."", 'Honestly, i thought this was another fake pokemon game. but it blew me away. the game is better than Pokemon, with vast Creo, prestige and more...... and it was just a dollar. best game I bought, keep it up imfilmity. and i want to see this on Switch i would buy it no matter the cost. u guys rock keep making the game better we all love it u guys. dont listen to haters 😜😜😃😃😀😀🤗🤗💪💪', ""Love this game. Have played through and beat it before and was wanting to play through again before the second game comes out. Just as great as I remembered only issue I am having is when I open the Creopedia my screen goes black. The music still plays but it won't let me do anything and I have to reset the game. Now I can manage to play the game without having to look in the Creopedia, and there is a creopedia online so not huge problem. But I'm on an LG Style 3 if you wanna look into it."", 'The best adventure, capture and battle monster game. The graphic and animation are awesome! But only one thing which is multiplayer, if it fixed I will give 5 stars. Overall its a very amazing and fun game to play ^_^', ""It's very similar to a pokemon game and it's pretty fun.It can be very addictive.It doesn't need much space and you can even play offline.It's totally worth spending some cash on it.If you don't like this game it's because it's not your type not because it's bad."", 'This game doesnt get old to me no matter how many times I play. I beat it for the first time the other day and its still fun but...now I wish the adventure didnt have to end. I have the dlc wit the extra Alphite story..but even thats not enough. Give this more updates at a time and add maps and Creo..make it live on!! Not a lot play still but I do, hoping some sort of hype hits this game soon. Anyway. Great game overall and still love it.', 'It really is a great game. I love that you have so many creatures to choose from! Its a really great game that at first seems like a rip off of Pokemon, but it really is just that same form of game rather than a blatant recreation. The mechanics are similar only in the form of rpg it is, even then only in battle, but other than that its entirely independent and unique! 10/10, would play again!', ""This is one of the best games I've ever played! Some additions though, would be amazing: -More quests. After I beat the colosseum, it was pretty boring. -More moves, abilities, and traits to the creo. Once you've unlocked all the moves, its just the exact same moves. For some creo, they aren't even that good. -A multiplayer setting! -The option to have more than one game slot. Thank you, though, ilmfinity, for this great game!"", ""This game is very good. Definitely way better then Pokemon. I love how there are a lot of features and tactics you can use. I'll for sure get evocreo 2 when it comes out."", ""I would rate 5 stars, but the game doesn't load, only showing a black screen. The game used to be amazing and I loved the story. Please dix the bug asap. Edit: The game loads now and I love it. Just seeing the variety of creo and NPC's is amazing. Although I would love to see more quests, creo, fights, and areas added to the game."", 'THANK YOU SOOO MUCH DEVS FOR FIXING THE BLACK SCREEN! I APPRECIATE YOUR EFFORTS SO MUCH! I don\'t experience the black screen anymore ^^ edit: Hello ilmfinity! sorry for bugging you devs again, but I have another problem. While using the game, I clicked on ""creopedia"" and then the screen turned black. I Constantly restarted the game, it didn\'t work. I couldn\'t use my creopedia anymore. Sorry if it\'s another black screen problem, haha. Again, I\'ll appreciate it if you all can help! <3', 'Really fun. Quite unique take and very unique attacks. And the difficulty is pretty high which keeps me very interested.', 'I actually really like this game, mainly due to how it differentiates from pokemon. The mechanic of evolutions based on the elements used is great and it seems you all tried hard on this. The designs are also consistent across the board with only one I didnt like much. I have a good feeling about the sequel and I hope it will be great. :D', ""I'm not sure about this game. I played the free demo and I was intrigued enough to buy the full version, but I don't know... Battles get kind of repetitive after a while and there's just not that same incentive to explore the map as other similar games... It just... It feels kind of dull after a few hours of playing."", ""I absolutely love this games,I think it's great,it could improve on the story a bit and you finish to quickly but overall it's a good game,part 2 really sucks tho"", ""This game is very very fun to play if anybody has free time. Me personally I enjoy every minute that I play the game. Can't wait until the Creator's come out with something new for the game."", ""I just wanna recommend adding more ways to earn prime gemmas like daily login or smthng.. I really love playin the game and I still play it even though I have completed the game. It would also be good if there are more ways to enjoy the game like battle tent or something.. The only thing I do now is farm for shinies and genetically modify creos and it get boring on the long run. Btw I'm not complaining, I do enjoy the game thats all"", ""It's a super fun game and I've honestly enjoy playing it. I am however having an issue where when I try and open the Creopedia, my entire screen just goes black and I can't go back to my game, even though the music is still playing. I really hope they can fix this issue..."", 'This game is great and really fun. It is also really calming to play and it is well made. I love all the Creo and over all it is great to play!', 'Disappointed. The game freeze when i want to meet the mom and i cant pick-up any gem. Moreover i cant sync the account with my google. I already play free version of the game in the past. I decided to buy the pro ver and i got a big expectation. Sadly, so many bugs and i cant play multiplay. Will play again if these bugs are fixed', ""I personally really love this game. I find it fun and it's definitely worth the price, but the only reason it's not getting 4 stars is an issue I have when using the creopedia. Everytime i try to open it I get a black screen that doesn't seem to go away."", ""I really enjoy this game the only problem I have is that it tends to freeze every so often. Not sure if it's just my phone or what"", 'This game is fun to play! So much creo to find and places to visit. The design of the creos, the battle mechanic is unique. After the latest updates, everything work smoothly! Overall, I love this game.Thank you for the hard work!', 'The game is really great but, whenever I tap the creopedia option my screen would be all black. I tried tapping the others in the options and it works fine. I also tried clearing my cache and restarting my device but it keeps happening. Pls fix this problem...']"

If you have never experienced the funny, and mighty powerful Bard, then get on the Bard train! This single player medieval, fantasy RPG is a very good game. Sometimes I admit the levels later in the story are kinda repetetive, they still bring great amusement and time consuming deathly fun, you get cool minions, they are summoned using musical instruments by your Bard. Also lots of cool weapons and some armor's. (Add more armor please!) Great story too"", 'A very special rpg. Fans of rpgs and fantasy storytelling alike should get a kick out of this. Very witty dialogue and scenarios satirise all the usual tropes. The voice talents are top notch. Cary Elwes (Princess Bride) feels right at home here. The Bard is an irredeemable, selfish, nitwit the likes of which pop culture plays with again and again. However here, they never attempt to make him sweet or cuddly, which somehow makes the game all the more funny.', ""Tried to load the game twice.

B******* cuz I really love this game"", ""I have this on ps4 but it runs a lot cleaner on this version. I'd suggest you pick this one up since it's cheaper and runs better. I just wish I could play it on a bigger screen. Great job on this one!"", 'This game is excellent, this is what you call a quality mobile game. Great story Great graphics Great audio Great controlls Great, great, great. Very easily deserved 5 starts.', 'The game is really exceptional for mobile though the humor is a bit dated it is still interesting enough. Fourth wall breaking is a bit tired these days and I think the game would benefit without it.', ""One of the best mobile games I've run into. It has quality graphics, voices, sound, scripting, etc. You don't have to spend a cent to finish it all either. Gameplay is easy, for instance if you find a better item it automatically replaces the one you have. No need to struggle with item management. It is even pretty funny with well written conversations, musical numbers and a nice plot twist at the end. My only complaint is I wanted more."", ""Look, this game has a lot more to it than a lot of Android / mobile games. The songs are entertaining, the dialog humorous, controls are decent. But... They do not tell you that if you have your cloud sync saves on (save games to Google drive), and you play offline for whatever reason (in my case, FIVE HOURS of progress), and then regain internet, that you're cloud save will likely overwrite your current save. You'll lose everything, and you can't get it back. It's not worth playing that again."", ""A real blast. The humor is just right and you can't help but empathise with both the bard and the narrator. The plot is actually decent, it being a parody. The camera can be a bit annoying at times, as with the movement scheme which may make you walk into traps you've spotted but neither are bug issues"", ""Game is excellent with some hilarious dialouge. The only negative are the few bugs I encountered where an npc or enemy will glitch out. One such case is in the Highland Park where Mell gets stuck and doesn't open the magic gates. All these can be fixed by saving and restarting the game, but it causes a lot of backtracking. Other than that, this game is very good and worth the price."", ""I can't believe every single character is voiced. Every shopkeeper is different. Brings me back to the good old days when games were complete and didn't need any updates or DLC. I think all game companies should go back to releasing complete games that need little to no updates. Awesome job!!"", ""Very good port, I missed out on this on PS2 but I'm happy to have it on Android. It's just as good as it was said to be in reviews"", 'Hilarious old school RPG fun. Good game play and graphics, a true homage to a classic. Highly recommended.', 'Love the game and all the wise crack that it contains wish you could edit the camera view as some areas are difficult to see the enemies. Also the game glitches sometimes mid play and battle. Still giving a 5 because I do enjoy it in all. Thank you.', ""Lots of fun! The characters are funny and story is interesting! I'm enjoying it a lot!"", ""Game was awesome, wish my ps4 controller didn't have as much lag though... that was literally my only issue."", ""Only 10 min in and i can see I'm going to love this game. Love the humor an the game play. I wish you could change the view but thats a minor detail, I'm willing to put up with a minor detail for such a great game. I mean seriously, I love my rpg, and no game pulls you in that quick like this game has already in just the short time ive been playing. Well back to the game, just wanted to write this post."", 'There is a bug in the highland park. The guy stoped opening the gates even the area on top of the stairs is all cleared.', ""Missed this one on XBOX, but so glad I got it here. · Touch controls are better than KOTOR, Jade Empire, and all the GTA games. (Plus you can customize them a bit) & there's an option for a games of you have one. · Gameplay is like a simple & fun version of Baldur's Gate (though the story & dialogue is much funnier) · Graphics are great. It's a PS2/XB era title, so it may not look as good as modern mobile, but it more than makes up for that with the level of options available (tweak it to your phone's performance) Basically, look... If you've ever searched the Play Store forever looking for a decent RPG that wasn't a soulless, sterile cash-grab hiding behind shiny visuals (hey Gameloft!) you can stop here, because this is it. Highly, HIGHLY recommend."", ""very entertaining game well worth the 2.99 and it's controller compatable."", ""Controls are easy to use with my xbox one controller. No clue about touch since I havent bothered to use them. The game is constantly funny, and sure to be worth every cent. No doubt I'll be playing this through multiple times, if only for the song in the bar at the beginning. Graphics seem like they could be a little better, but that may just be my tablet. Its fairly low end, and not very recent. I'll update on that when I upgrade next year."", ""I haven't been playing this game long, but, so far, it's fun! I'm hooked already! I've been looking for RPGs like this and they are hard to find. I had a little bit of a problem with downloading the extra file. It kept wanting to stop downloading. I had to keep exiting out the game and come back in and have it resume where it left off to get it to download completely. That was irritating, which was why I gave 4 stars instead of 5. I would definitely recommend this game."", ""It's a pretty cool game. You get the 3 originals for free when you purchase it. The top down view is kind of janky but otherwise it's pretty fun."", ""Very good game so far! But I hate the view from above! 360° view would be GREAT! I think I'd have to give 5 stars all the way around if you have 360° view. But overall good game, keep up the good work! p.s. The original Bards Tale was my very 1st RPG game on the Commodore 64 and it was GREAT!! Great job with that!"", 'Loved the humour, music and story. Want more please!!!!', ""The only thing that needs to be put in this game,... to make it the best thing since sliced bread is. Outlandish guns and more detailed swords and thanks again for making a game that makes you feel like a kid again. If you do this you'll make more money than you ever thought possible,.,..... maybe some sort of crafting ability"", ""Fun game with a lot of snark, graphics are so so but it's just an android game, so can't have too high of expectations"", ""Do you have a phone that can run this game? If your answer to that is yes... then why haven't you bought this game yet? This is seriously the best full featured game I have played on the Play store. And it runs beautifully on my Samsung Galaxy A3 2017 with the High Definition pack (3.5GB) with max settings (60FPS). Something that I enormously appreciate is the option to install the game files to an SD card. You can make this choice after you install the app and run it for the first time. I've only been playing for a couple of hours and I'm hooked, and so so relieved that the gameplay actually requires a bit of skill. I'm also a bit of a penny-pincher and I hate microtransactions, but I'm enjoying the game so much that I happily spent another $2 on a few perks (I like to earn my loot though). I'll update this review as I have more to report. Great job dev's! 😉"", 'The Bard is a fun and highly entertaining adventure. Some may not like the top down control view and linear path, but with many cut scenes and options for heavy sarcasm or...erm...heavier sarcasm, the gamer is assured of enjoying the full richness of life with the Bard. Guide the Bard along the quest path, gaining riches and notoriety along the way. Defeat Bad Guys, witches, undead and goblin type things with your companions ( which you learn to summon via your magical music). Hilarity ensues.', ""The auto-aim would fire at enemies while other times it fires at the wall or barrels while an enemy is next to you. I've tried to manually aim but would still fire at a wall instead. Once or twice the dialogue scenes would get stuck and you are forced to skip it. It seems like the game would change your talent from arrow storm I was using to dog trainer (1st talent on the list). Gave up trying to play the other two games. Loved the game, story and banter when it worked as expected."", ""This is a great game but I seem to jave missed some of the tunes. I would buy the tunes just to play with them but I don't see them in the inapp purchases. I do wish I could go back into some of the places where the tunes are that are now locked to me. :'( also it would be nice if the in app purchases were activatable. So that if I started a new game I could use them again. (especially seeings that I seem to be blocked from some of the spells)"", 'okay this is a must have for anyone who enjoys a time consuming rpg with good story to indulge along side many side quests. Play on hardest mode if you enjoy grinding an earning your stripes in rpg type games. You will not be disapointed cause otherwise I wouldnt have put 5 stars. Very small number of bugs.. crashes once every other day.', 'Incredibly funny with tunes that will definitely be stuck in your head for a long time and the storie was marvelously made to run on a modern mobile phone']"

FINAL FANTASY V for the Android is here!

FINAL FANTASY V first debuted in 1992 as the fifth installment in the iconic FINAL FANTASY series. This wildly popular RPG was the first in the series to sell over two million copies.

This groundbreaking title allowed players to customize their characters with an unprecedented degree of freedom thanks to a new job and ability system that further improved and refined the job change system used in FINAL FANTASY III. The title also saw the introduction of more detailed and expressive 2D character models, which helped further fuel the player's imagination, making the story even more immersive and fun to play.

Story

Earth, water, fire, and wind...
These are the four crystals that bring peace and prosperity to the world,
but they have lost their power and are now on verge of destruction.

It all started with a strange change in the wind...

Sensing something ominous astir, the young traveler Bartz astride his chocobo, Princess Lenna of Castle
 Tycoon, the mysterious Galuf, an old man with a bad case of amnesia, and the pirate captain Faris soon find that fate has brought the former strangers together.

Something I recommend is you should be able to spend some of the money you've earned buying stamina and energy instead of always having to wait until it builds up or buy it with diamonds. Other than that it's a pretty good game, would definitely buy if it was made for PS4 & XBOX1"", 'This is really kinda addictive game, but what I really love about this is you can actually interact with other mafias making the experience wholesome. You gotta be patient in building your account. And be sure with your account settings before you decide to settle for it. (research!!!) because changing some of the changes in the setting (like name of the account) while you are playing cost tons of diamonds and you gotta work your ass off to earn that', 'Pretty good. The game would be better if it has. Airports that you could own or even planes helicopters or or aerial gunship F-16 fighter jet or even Harrier jet You have a list of all the things that you can own. Right up under Vehicles you should put planes / helicopter.', 'Great all round strategy game.been playing since 2013 has some high lvl (380+) players who are willing to help out a ""noob"".it has a exciting live chat which is free to use which is great as you dont have to leave game while your stam/nrg refills.. I feel 3* represents where your games at,there\'s still alot you can do like implement new business in the other countries or make a chat room in the casino? You let us see who gets what so why not put a chat room too like shoutbox 🤔 or a mute button?', ""Just play TORN. It's better. The dev claims there is pmayer protection until level 25 but that is a lie. You get attacked instantly. I am level 15 and get attacked mire times than I can count since the very first minute of game play. No new player protection. Constant attacks to the point of uninstallation. Review was lowered more after the dev outright lied in their response. Very shady."", ""Nice game, slightly complicated in the beginning, but after about half hour, you're pretty much up to speed. Was surprised to find that you need stamina, not energy to do jobs, so don't make the same mistake I did. Still love the game though, six months on and I'm truly hooked!"", '💎yes mm hmm great game yup the game be fun but diamonds run it and you charging way too much for diamonds big disadvantage for new players. Almost a hopeless feeling overcomes you once you realize you put a few hundred in the game and your still getting beat up by resets...Also.. technical issues always happen and devs do nothing to compensate players for time lost and diamonds wasted every time their game malfunctions... and for that reason the game is getting 2 stars...', 'Good time killer fun game. Its a addictive game but as soon as you run out of stamina or energy which takes no time then its on to another game for a hr until i get energy an stamina back. It would be nice to have something in game to do why waiting for stamina an stuff to come back.', ""Great experience so far. Takes time to add mobs but worth it. Very in-depth. Used to play MafiaMofo for a long time. It's an awesome change of scenery. Developers support is top notch as well as great and responsive Customer Support."", ""I love the game, although I lost my main account and you guys stopped trying to help me recover it. 😒 You know, the guy said I had my account still connected through Facebook, but since I wasn't 18 (will be Feb. 10) he pretty much just dropped it from his priority list. If it gets him in trouble yay! His name is Tom, that's all I know"", 'I can definitely recommend it. its the Best Mafia Game App in the 2020!!! And it has more 100.000 active players! I have tryed 10 diffrent top mafia apps. But this is for sure the Top 1 active and fun game! - You can join a gang or create you own gang, allso the gangs can be in cartels. Collect turfs and alot more! - Every week theres a tournement, You and you gang will fight other gangs! So you allways has a chance too get on the leaderboard! And claim different rewards!', ""As this is my First time playing this and I'm only at a level 7 I'd have to say so far so good. It plays well, and smoothly. So far no glitches.😊"", ""It's a great game about building up and teaming with others. Manage your resources and just be active. Definitely not P2W but you get out of it what you put into it."", ""Only downloaded to respond to a developer response on a rating. Player protection is protection from attack. Not a capped number of attacks in a 24hr time span. Its player protection or no player protection. Understand the game.type you're offering...thanks"", ""its ok. figuring it out. like how complicated ir gets as you level up. dislike how diamond (paying) players are at a huge advantage.. oay to play but i read that with enough grind (a years worth), you can get competitve with the diamond players. hopefully we'll see!"", 'Nice game, love the way it works. Responding to DYNAMICNEXT, I would rate 5 stars if there was more customisation of weapons and you could visualise the AIs in your ""mafia/mob/gang""', ""Love the game. Been with them since beta version. The developers work on fixing the bugs in the game & are pretty reasonable at that. Follow their FAQs & you can't go wrong at all."", 'I really enjoy the game. Seems simple. Not too hard to grasp. The gang stuff is a little much at first but its slowly coming to grasp.', ""Very fun. Needs more bosses, more business to buy. DEFINITELY needs more weapons you can get. You got to spend money in order to have an upper edge on other people. There's no select profile pics you can choose from to change your characters appearance. Needs a better feal to the game. But all in all. If very fun to play but just needs more stuff in the game. Balance things out and it would be perfect"", ""Game is really good. It's great for a game to play on your downtime and it isn't pay to win just give the game time and you'll be good."", ""Great for the entire family.take out your credit cards because that's what you're going to need to finish certain parts of this game. make a 99-cent purchase in this game for the first time and get 1000 free diamonds how cool is that."", ""Love these tips would love it if you could do another one but death jam where all the rappers and female rappers are at war it's all ready a game but for game cube and the first xbox that came out I'm a big fan of the game and ones like this"", 'The game is fun but there could be improvements made😎+ like when youre in a fight and die you should stay dead or be given an opportunity to buy your life back and put a hit bounty out on the guy who killed you... ... ...', ""Note for new and/or old players according to the developers of the game anyone with multiple accounts is a repeat offender and should/will be permanently banned by suspending IP addresses if they fixed their business perspective in the game people wouldn't have to reset or create other accounts but since their lazy and listen to cry babies those who play for fun and enjoy the game gotta suffer"", ""There's people that are your level but have more than the allowed amount of mobs, just all kinds of lies. Not worth the download."", ""I've been playing for over 4 years now. I've only spent $5 on diamonds. You would have to spend tens of thousands to keep up with most of the top players. I did build slow though, lots of sp on energy for bosses & tournaments. I'm a defense player for sure. You can build well with free diamonds from promos & rewards. My only complaint is when the assignment for expanding your hitlist came out. Really not fair that levels so much higher can kill you. Otherwise it's fun. Watch out for bullies."", 'Good game but sucks majority of the stuff thats good is only bought in diamonds. At the same time the diamonds are so expensive for not much value given. Good game but seem like they tryna get back a little.', ""Yo it's ok...nah y'all kick some of the most dedicated players. No other game I've played does that. Never even heard of anyone being banned till this game. I have heard of people being suspended on some games. I could understand if they cheated you out of money or made a terrorist threat then again this is a mafia game and meant to be treacherous. Would not have that real mafia feel if it wasnt. Never permanently, but hey to each there owm"", 'Great game. Been playing for long time. Lot of things to do. Can fight and have gang wars.', 'literally love this game..i was busy for a few months but i received many diamonds and held good money during my time away. so another words besides getting attacked from being inactive and my mob being small...the game took care of my account and made it possible to not struggle and play without having to pay..great game!!!! patience is key with the game. you do not have to pay to play..go online look up what is confusing you and i swear its as addicting as a ps4 or xbox game but more !!', ""This game needs a way to report users who harass and/ or repeatedly attack players after I asked them to stop. It's not worth playing because that's a form of bullying. Uninstalled!! Not satisfied with the game."", 'Giving this game 1* cos couldnt give no * tried logging in today and it says im blocked,tried uninstalling/installing no diff still says same,im not a player who makes fake accounts to war i just build diff accounts with diff strategys either all attack,all def,or just do bosses and assignments in which case you just add to stam and energy..been playing this game A LoNG time since 2013 and this is how im treated..would change or modify rating if this is resolved,thanks it got resolved 😄', 'Its a great game the concept is perfect the only thing i would like to see is more options for crime in your beginning stages.', ""I can't even play because as when I get on i'm dead, and I can't even heal because as soon as I do I get killed almost immediatly after."", 'Great app !! Super fun game and options. Keeps you hooked . everyone should try it at least once . what do you got to loose but 10 mins?', ""Good game so far. Progress pretty fast. Made alot of friends in multiple gangs I've been involved with. Highly recommended game to download"", 'My experience was terrible....I played over 3 years and spent alot of real money.... devs allowed someone to steal my acct from me .... no help whatsoever....thanks devs', ""Is to really have a player figure out an easier way to play this game and I know how to get to the next level and you know so on and so on I think I'd be more War online with this game if I knew but I get so frustrated with trying to figure it all out"", ""It's extremely fun and it can get addicting. But all in all its pretty awesome Its also different than most other game I have played"", ""Could use some improvement like when it says my funds are running low and can't buy something when I clearly have enough but other than that a decent game so far""]"

You get to collect a wide variety of heroes with different traits and abilities, giving you a chance to mix and match teams for campaign and pvp.

I think you should have a dark character named ""Double Shooter Tinol"" His weapon would be a wand with two sides, so two areas to blast magic. His basic attack would shoot two blasts from his wand that have a 25% chance to disease. His first special attack would have Tinol throw his wand in the air, which spins, hitting every character once with blasts of magic and having a chance to give a random debuff to enemies.

I like the style of their games and the fact that you get what you pay for and not some trap like other games where it's anyone's guess on how far you can get with the initial price of the game. Good job you two, and I hope to see some new games from y'all in the future. To anyone else deffinetly buy them for the small price, that way you don't spend money on a game that makes you send more just to keep going! Thanks!!"", 'Nice tactical RPG, quite simpified compared to the likes of Baldurs Gate etc. but then again very in-depth compared to 99% of mobile games. Great story telling and the controls are just right for mobile devices. If you enjoy the more classic RPGs and want something to play while not having access to your PC this might be for you with tons of hours of gameplay and decent replayability. Enemy variety is a bit lacking but it does a good job of placing you in diverse combat scenarios.', ""Just a wonderful strategy RPG. I can always trust the Trese Brothers' work."", 'Great game. A true gem on the play store and worth every cent', ""So far so good. The levels are a bit long, but I'm enjoying the storyline. Also instead of making people buy the Paladin and the other special characters, why not let them be unlocked after finishing hard mode? It seems a little too greedy to make people pay for the game and then have to pay for the character classes. Would have given 5 stars otherwise."", 'Functional, straightforward tactics rpg. I enjoyed the classic themes and art. However, tactics and battles lack variety; battles are grindy and slow. Choke point, check. Debuffs, check. Chip, chip, chip away at the baddies. Mainly an exercise in concsientious team management. Few interesting options for team development; maybe IAP characters are more versatile, but base characters have a pretty inflexible role to play. Most people probably have better ways to spend their time.', ""Went back to this recently after trying frontiers.. not bad & definitely not lazy on storyline etc. I've made it to Red Hill assault but seems like every combat ya gotta buff/debuff to the max. Man, that got old fast \U0001f92d Please address enemy ability to 'point blank' attack with missile weapons (or at least allow my own idiot to respond in kind) it's a slog enough as it is without weird little inconsistencies like that. Make the sequel have a bit more non-linear yadda & sidequests. Merry thingmas!"", ""I can't really recommend this game. Perhaps it's because I've played more recent Trese Bros games and this one doesn't compare favourably. Ultimately that's testament to how much their games continue to improve. For an RPG the early stages are just too slow and grindy. You have to fight the same enemy again and again, using the same limited tactics. The loot and level ups give minor upgrades, so it just feels like there's nothing to look forward to. I recommend Trese's sci-fi games over this."", ""I think there's 2 choices with phone games. Free with ads and cash grabs or, like this, small upfront cost and that's it. It's a quality game with so much depth I can't recommend enough. Great developer who responds quickly too which is a bonus"", 'Love it! Many characters to pick from I am not sure which one I want in a group', 'Another wonderful mobile game from the Trese Brothers. One of the best on the market in its genre.', 'Enjoyable so far good price for the game but disappointed at the price of the extra characters', 'could do with more classes and such, but its a good turn based rpg.', 'Good game, interface is not optimal, but great, story-driven game with challenging fights', 'What I have played of it so far is good. I have not been disappointed yet with a game by the Trese Brothers.', ""It's a fun game with a solid story line and graphics. No exaggerated anime characters or silly voice acting. The games the Trese brothers make aren't like most mobile games, and each one is better than the last. I believ this is one of their older ones, and I'm really looking forward to a possible sequel."", ""I've played this game 3 times so far. change up the characters and it's a different experience each time. play only nightmare. strategy, hp and sp a must. Don't re-stat till level 18. Wish there was a similar game but old west setting."", 'Same thing as with STF. HOS no longer works on my device after the latest update. Good thing I held off of buying TBF. As im sure that will get updated too and eventually would stop supporting my device. Sad day for me. Great developers, great game, outdated device.', ""I love turn based strategy games like this. It reminds me of the old Sega Genesis shining Force days. One complaint I do have is that even with display set at maximum resolution the font is difficult to read. I am a visually impaired person so although I don't need gigantic font a little bit larger would be appreciated."", ""Limited and uninspired skills makes gameplay repetitive. The numerous random cut-scenes places your characters haphazardly and can result in tallied deaths; creating negative experiences because you no longer control your characters. Writing and storyline is okay, not bad but exactly good. There's a bunch of IAPs for things like additional classes, crafting, respecs, etc. It's not bad for an indie game I guess, but unlike some that rival games from more established companies, this is a very indie quality offering."", ""I'm a big fans of trese brothers game such as star trader series, but this one is on my bottom list. The battles are really repetitive. After a few hours its getting boring for me. Even the lore and story are not really that good if you compare it to star trader. I want to give it 1 stars but since Cory made another good game, ill just leave it at 3 stars here."", 'Almost as if you guys sold your souls The 4 Dark Ones just to make this venture happen; It\'s difficult to put down, the action is satisfying as Hell, the Cleric is a tank when used correctly, I mean this is what an RPG on mobile is supposed to feel like! No generic pixel graphics, memes just to force humor/narration, or any ""Idle"" mechanics that we see too much of.', ""Awesome game. The dev's are truly dedicated to making a quality product."", 'I love and hate this game. I love the turn based strategy games like this and keep playing it. On the other hand, this game is also the reason I have broken several phones from frustrating attempts to do something in game.', 'What the hell! I can\'t even open this thing. Every time it says ""unfortunately heroes of steel has stop"". What is this, i bought this thing and i can\'t even play it.', ""Hands down the most well-written RPG I've ever seen on android."", 'Great game worth the money. I really wish they would make a second one or they would make more characters to play with. I would buy more characters to play through it', 'Fantastic game in a small package. Epic story and worldbuilding, intuitive fighting mechanics, smart pathfinding, and varied character development paths. Artwork is quirky but ultimately charming. Highly recommended.', 'a couple things could be better more traps but not stacked for 4 traps in a row. if your out of range move forward to do the action. i think heros should be able to pass through one another.', 'A great turn based RPG. Simple to play, but with good depth. In addition, the story is interesting and motivates you to save your team.', ""Fun and classic RPG. Love the style and we'll done controls that work great for mobil. It's great that's it's not a giant download as well!"", 'The game overall is fun. I recently purchased the Rogue to try it out and it was unlocked Phone was acting up so i deleted game and reinstall and the rogue character is unable to be used. And can you guys please help check it out? I am not sure who to contact', 'This looks like a pc game ported to phone. The various text on menus and selectors is so tiny i can\'t read it on a 5"" screen. Not worth trying to play, instant regret.', 'Solid game. It actually feels better as a touch interface than on PC!', 'An amazing RPG, flat out, regardless of platform.', 'what I enjoy in an old fashion slash bang bang game. Enjoyable and nerve wracking. No. ads', 'Always a great from these guys.', 'I like the game a lot.

Fix for ambush on all tiles in ""The Hills Have Spiders""","['Even if the title is beloved from many people around the world. In this app they totally failed. Poor gameplay with few options. But the BIGGEST PROBLEM is that the texts are so small that you hardly can read them and there is no way you can make the fonts bigger. Too also the customer support told me to just ask for refund. There is no way they will fix it', ""There is a huge paywall. GIGANTIC. unfortunately the game is so good you can only play as far as your poorness lets you. I bought it on a offer, for 1USD and I honestly think it's worth it. Invest only if you can"", 'The game is a lot of fun. Put about 20 hours into the main game. Kind of a bummer the DLC costs more than the game itself by a landslide.', 'I absolutely love this game. It is quite simple and a great dungeon crawl. The characters are great, the missions are fun. My only gripe is that I have spent a long time playing this game, but when I got my new phone my old game disappeared which was disheartening as I put so much time into this game.', 'Still own the board game from the 90s and love it. So this adaptation is fun to play on the train or commuting 👌', ""I was loving this game until i hit the paywall, and now I hate it. $5 for each expansion is a bit high. $3 per character... I hate this method. I'd give this a 4 or 5 but I won't fall into this pay scheme. Also, grinding for gold gets extremely repetitive. My warriors now require 15k gold to level up. By the time I have that much gold all my other warriors are hitting the xp cap which i have to pay another 15k in gold. I'm not giving you more money for some gold. I'm extremely disappointed."", 'Fun take on Hero Quest, just not as fun as it should be. Great music and atmosphere, loads of quests and gear.. however, pay to play extra characters and areas ruins it, along with the bizarre equipment management system and badly designed ""town actions"" interface. Come on devs, stop being so greedy.', 'Wow, this game has no rules or strategy for a board game. Enemies randomly appear from cleared out dungeon sections, sometimes even in the middle of your slow moving party. It even determines randomly if your attacks hit or not, in the randomly generated floor lay outs. Oh, and the game is completely infected with micro transactions for a paid game.', ""I'm giving a 5 star review because I love Warhammer Fantasy, but to be honest the in app purchases are too expensive for too little, the cities and dungeons are repetitive, and considering that the game takes up almost a gigabyte there is surprisingly little explorable map and enemy roster, especially considering that every dungeon and city is pretty much exactly the same."", 'Wow. This game is really bad. The UI is horrible. The setting that is supposed to make the text clearer is still far too small for a human to read. I played mostly through the tutorial, exited for 5 mins, then returned and had to start again. Felt like a chore and not fun in the slightest. Terrible, terrible, terrible.', 'Great graphics bought all the extra content, nice to be able to play warhammer quest when ever I want without having to get a group together looking forward to finishing it with every character and every level. People are complaining about the full price of this game with the expansions and extra heros but for the total cost it is fair for a mobile game considering other mobile games out there take $1000 from you to enjoy the game', 'bought this for one USD on sale. Not worth a penny more. Play is repetitive, story is poorly written and boring, graphically or sound wise, nothing is going on. sorry to the three different dev teams but no creativity or love went into making this game. and just to be clear, I am a fan of the Warhammer universe.', ""Nice graphics and simple game play but over all poorly executed. The RND is so bad your hero's couldn't hit a barn door even if it fell on them. The consistent spawning of random powerful encounters makes it fustrating and with the terrible hit chance makes most sessions unbearable and impossible. It can take so long to kill an enemy that by the time youve nearly finished another batch will spawn in."", ""Not a review of the games as I've never played it (due to being incompatible with the Samsung Tab S4 tablet). This review is of the developer. I've attempted to contact them twice via the email listed here about getting a refund or them making this game compatible with the tablet(I am sure it would work), they haven't said no....what's worse is they haven't replied to my emails. At all. So a waste of money and I wouldn't recommend this games based on their support."", 'Great time-wasting, fully turn-based RPG with detailed and graphically beautiful top-down graphics and atmospheric sounds. Controls are easy, even on a budget 4"" mobile phone, with smooth-as-silk gameplay. The IAP is the fair kind, opening new characters, equipment and expansion packs/areas. Worth the coin IMHO. Great game for both short or long sessions, with both a decent story-arc as well as numerous random-loot side quests. Well-made game.', 'Great dungeon crawler! Graphic are very good, the gameplay is no nonsense,straight forward bloody fun. Only complaint is the Grey Wizard is pretty much useless,to the point of add a perma-death choice simply be rid of him,or swap for another hero that doesnt suck. the power variant room to room with lamo wiz is silly, why drag him along if half the time he has no power? The Waywatcher being able to attack a melee and fire a ranged attack is cool. dump wiz', ""Love it. Just wish they'd expand on the game to keep it going, introducing some additional content and other maps, characters, gear and stuff. And I don't usually write comments or rate games."", ""this game is no more than a demo. you think you've got 3 area to work through before spending even more money. think again. after a couple of towns your forced to spend out on the expansions to continue. not a full game at all. not what I paid for!"", ""Mediocre game play that would be briefly fun if it weren't tied too tightly to micro-transactions. If I have to pay for the game, I'm not spending money to buy enough gold to be able to level up my characters."", 'I love it. This game has loads of content, and provides an immersive Warhammer experience. Bearing in mind the limitations of the platform & hardware at the time it was made it looks & plays remarkably well.', 'Very nice game hope the additional contents also go on sale otherwise I might max my initial characters level without progressing thru the base game. I reach level 4 on my starting characters just doing sidequests before I got curious and completed the first quest', 'I was enjoying my gameplay bought new characters and maps.I then lost ALL my progress and hard fought saved games and had to start from scratch,after it synced with google play and this after days of hard work!Why should I recommend this game then?I could not even get a refund!', 'Poor. Turn based game where your attacks miss constantly and opponents hit. Gold coins are randomly stolen from you in towns meaning you cant ever upgrade/progress. The game is nearly unplayable.', '“no longer compatible with your device“ WHY? I have a high end phablet, you happily took my money and now its not compatible? Fuc**ng rip-off.', 'Want new region? buy it. Want new hero? buy it. Want legendary equipment? buy it. Pro- buy what u willing to pay/play. Con- translate from tabletop to mediocre mobile game.', 'in-app purchases are a huge cash grab. +$30 for the whole thing? no thanks. should bundle the some of the dlc to make it more palatable.', 'Amazing game! get this over the sequal, its cheaper and better.....if you loke D&D or anything gamesworkshop related you should love this game...... go hard for the most fun', 'A faithful rendition of the classic Games Workshop board game set in the much missed Old World with all its colourful lore.', ""Deleted multiple saves. Fun to play but not when it decides to delete you're gameplay."", 'Fun game and feels like clasic warhammer quest board game .', 'Price of entry gets you only a small chunk of the game the rest is locked behind a ton of mico transactions.', 'The graphics are poor and the battles too easy. Boring game.', ""You think you're buying the game, then once you're playing find out need to spend £20 for the full game..."", ""That's it? 2 hrs maybe 3 tops of repeat game play and then a lot of money to expand."", 'Doesnt load on S10+', 'just like the original board game fun!', 'Excelent game and worth the money', 'A really fun game', 'The darkest game I ever played.', 'do not buy cash grab']"

Additionally the throphy value of bases are to random with minimal valuation of bases and losing a battle isn't exactly directly valued evenly with winning a battle.

Be sure to check out the changes list for full details.","[""Great game, but some of the baddies could be a bit more balanced. Those damn snakes in the first floors are a total pain unless you can catch them off guard with a ranged weapon. So many times I've died in the first 4 floors simply because they dodged every hit and whittled me down to zero health. Annoying, but it hasn't stopped me from playing. Love the game!"", ""This game is very challenging for me, but I love playing it. I wish there were more games like this, because this genre really lacks quality traditional roguelikes! I think my favorite part is whenever I'm in a sticky situation and I have to think outside the box in order to solve the problem to stay alive. My least favorite thing is how samey the first part of the game is. If you die a lot, you will see a lot of the same enemies and even the same equipment. I guess I just gotta be better!"", 'Edit: Actually I wanted to give an idea for one of the supporter packs. I think it would be interesting to add something kinda like a sandbox mode, a lot like the game ""Your pixel dungeon"". There are so many more unique and interesting items and ways to play in shattered that I wanted to kind of explore all the different possibilitys to play it. It would be really cool.', ""It's fun, you can pick it up at any time as it's turn based. You must really consider what you use and how you use it when playing. Your life depends on your decisions. Something simple eating when you're not damaged can cause you to die later on because you didn't save your food. Every action must be thought about and be done in absolute confidence. Although, it is also fun to throw caution to the wind and see how far you get."", 'Here is the definition of value. Free to play, no ads, no in app purchases, constant updates (including new items, enemies, etc). Additionally this game runs without a hitch. Never crashes, stutters, drops inputs, just flawless. I have made over 100 runs on this game and will gladly be making more in the future. 10/10.', 'Very challenging. Would like to point out a problem i encountered with the screen though. At random when playing, usually after completing an action, there will be colored bars appearing at random all over the screen. Almost like static on a television. They disappear after the next action but left me confused. Any insight on this?', ""This fork of PD is entirely free and is best described as the epitome of deep yet succinct game design on Android. It maintains the one-handed accessibility of Pixel Dungeon with some tweaks for better flow. The classes are now balanced and you'll have a fair experience with any of them. Victory is no longer dependent on mostly luck and you can finally earn your wins. The game's variety is deceptively high and is being updated regularly."", ""I liked this game more before some recent changes on one of the bosses. First, you face him, and he runs away once you get him down to like 50% (coward), then you have to go through four trapped rooms to get four keys in order to get to where he's hiding. No room for error, or you die before you even get to the boss. Haven't gotten beyond that level since those changes. Very frustrating."", ""This is the best permutation of the original pixel dungeon and the only Android game that has stayed in my rotation for years. Regular updates, new items, boss redesigns, class overhauls, and thoughtful rebalancing keep this interesting time and again. Hundreds of playthroughs and I've managed to beat the game with 5 out of the 8 possible endgame classes so far."", ""Love the game. Play it regularly while I commute. Can be a bit bs when you miss an enemy 4 or 5 times in a row thats 1 level below you, to end up being killed by a skeleton or gnoll randomly when generally you maybe miss once. Also was there a change that made it so unlocking the subclasses permanently was removed? If so i don't like that change :("", ""My favorite of the pixel dungeon variants. Best graphics and gameplay. I wish we could get more characters or subclasses. Also add throwing item bonuses to the warrior and rogue. Maybe give rogues a chance to ricochet thrown items to another enemy nearby and warriors the ability for thrown weapons to penetrate to enemies behind the target. I'd also like to see class armor use charges, like artifacts, because the health cost isn't worth it."", ""Hands down the best version of Pixel Dungeon. I've been playing this game for years now, because every time I'm traveling I get hooked again. Improved UI with 4 quick select slots, nifty new items and the game constantly being updated. My only real wish is that there were a few new classes to chose from (a Sumonner of some sort would be mega-awesome) and maybe an item that benefits from having gold since gold's use kinda falls off in the late game."", ""Brutal and amazing game! Absolutely loved it back around 2014 or 2015 when I played it for the first time. I still remember how it took me ages to beat the first boss and how amazing it felt just to be able to progress a little bit further with each death. I was surprised to see all the updates and changes, but I'm glad that now I'll get to discover all this new stuff. Thanks for making such an enjoyable game!"", 'Many other apps come and go on my phone but this app is one I frequently come back to and never leaves my phone, the fact I can use it offline is a feature you see less and less with mobile games these days, it does improve upon the base game pixel dungeon and is definitely worth a try (this review is free of any outside influences and not sponsored)', 'The creator of this game regularly updates content that vastly improves the experience. The mechanics are similar enough that they feel true to the original game, but there is vastly more content available that makes it unique and very enjoyable. Definitely my favorite variant of the original Pixel Dungeon.', ""It's a very good game, here are some tips for new players: - Chug (unknown) potions and rap (unknown) scrolls - A curse can't be bad - food is good - Use seeds at doorways to get kills - If the chest starts attacking you then you are in trouble - dew is good - f*** the gnoll trickster - don't get cornered - DEVS: Balance food so starvation is more damaging but takes more time to get. - Food should appear a bit more - Able to buy things from sellers in dungeon? I want to use gold!"", 'I love this game! I just beat the game and it was a great experience. The controls are great! It was knda hard but it took me a day to get used to the difficulty but it was personally amazing!', 'Wonderful adaptation of the old classic.

All it doesn't do is directly tell you everything (tells you some things tho) and this means you can find the secrets yourself and thats kinda fun."", ""Fun game. Lots of replayability. I would have rated it 5 stars if not for the newest Tengu update. I don't play it anymore because that boss battle is now no more fun. Use one turn to take a potion and 3 bombs are blowing up on you. Go to move, you have 5 objects thrown at you. Nowhere to hide. Tengu killed it for me. Edit: Added a star for good, responsive dev."", ""I could not express the roller-coaster of emotions this game had brought to me. 66 games later, I beat the game. The 65th time I was just about to give up. The 1st time I felt the game had potentional, but I really didn't like it too much. As I explored the aspects of the game, I came to discover what really hooked me was all the different elements I had discovered. Multiple variants of enchantments, potions, and combinations of equipment that I could use. This game is GLORIOUS!"", ""I've had this game installed for years now. The improvements and changes are so much that it's no longer just a mod to the Pixel Dungeon but a whole new game itself, while still being loyal to the original one!"", 'I have been playing this game for years now and I gotta say, kudos to the dev for constantly updating and listening to the players of this game. If you think it is ""too difficult"" for your first tries this game isn\'t definitely for you - there are many ways to innovate when you encounter dilemmas in the dungeon and it\'s all about a matter of memorizing what is available to you and how to take advantage of that. Also bear in mind the frequency of some potions usually hints that they benefit you.', ""The latest update is a marked improvement. However, I've found a big bug that needs squishing. I picked up Leather Armor of Swiftness and meet the requirements. I cast 3 upgrade scrolls on it and the stats never went up. Previously, I'd seen the stats go up after closing my bag and reopening it. This time I quit the game, closed the app, and returned to still find no upgrade. Pretty disappointing considering the scarcity of upgrades. Also, it would be helpful if there were a bit more identify scrolls. I once lucked out and found 3 in a room on level 1, but usually I'm lucky to find 2 before I reach the goo. And with fairly good odds you're going to drink a liquid fire potion........ it gets annoying. EDIT FOR DEV: The upgrades showed up today actually. Guess it just took it's time to kick in. And to answer your question, it wasn't cursed at any point and I'd already identified it prior to upgrading. So maybe it's not a failure to upgrade, just a delay until it feels like it. :) Thanks for the response too."", 'its very frustrating and i liked it! i juat like to report with my progress from public release version got some problem when i opted out of the beta program all my characters unlocked and some badges had gone missing. can it still be retrieve? still 5 star tho', 'Good revision. Could be so much better still, though. I wish I could talk to the developers... I have SO many good ideas for this game ""series""', '""Really fun game, by far my favorite dungeon crawl yet on google play."" ""No complaint, keep doing what ur doing."" ""Love it.""', 'I love this game. It really trusts the players to learn the game. Like a real dungeon, you go in not knowing anything and discover how to survive the more you play. This is a very rewarding game.', 'I really love the game but there are a few issues and suggestions that would be greatly appreciated. First of all the difficulty skyrockets after the Dwarf king. The death gaze thing is too overpowered and should be nerfed in a pretty significant way. Next, appearance of potions of strength and Scrolls of upgrade should be more luck based in addition to depending on floor. So that if you are lucky you might be able to equip better stuff. Not a big chance, just 5% to 10% in place of other items.', ""I love it. With more content than normal pixel dungeon and content that js consistent with the game's style. Also the generation of the layout was also much improved making it more interesting."", ""An absolutely incredible game. I've played hundreds of runs, but each one is still unique. By far my favorite mobile game. Nothing else has the same challenge and fun."", ""I love this game, I would like to make a suggestion though. I think it would be interesting for certain enemy types to naturally be fighting each other in certain rooms. I imagine for instance, that bats and crabs may attack bandits and gnolls because animals aren't typically smart enough to differentiate friend and foe. Whereas they could also domesticate the animals if combat doesn't end in death, and then give them orders to strategize. Dwarves on the other hand would already be allies."", ""I've only made it to the fifth level boss at the point, though I've been looking for a different version of Pixel dungeon, this one is probably my favorite next to the remixed PD thanks guys!"", 'Great version of pixel dungeon. Love the guides to every thing. Would be awesome if this was mixed with skillful dungeon and had skills.', ""Pretty dang good honestly I've been on the search for a game close to the original and this is it. Its perfect in my opinion and could even be called a souls like."", 'Right out the gate, it\'s plagued by ridiculous difficulty without rhyme or reason, 9/10 times you won\'t even reach the first boss, but it has 4.9 stars so I guess people think that\'s all you need to make a good roguelike. EDIT: I get to the 1st boss on the regular. If I set my mind to it, I can reach the last guy semi-commonly, but it\'s a pain in the ass to put effort, play well, and still be assraped by bad RNG especially in the later levels. Where\'s the ""satisfying to improve at"" feature?', 'Great game, I like where this is going. Can this be a suggestion box too? I love RPGs and all the cards both you and the dungeon can hold up its sleeves. Biggest 1- Discovering secrets gives bonus exp or points towards increased perception/awareness for better merchant prices - Sharpening stones-Rare/unique monsters -Companions that spawn on bigger floors -Random encounters and events -Secret levers, torch levers etc -Boots, helmet -Side areas/zones -Shovels, digging areas -Food', 'This game even currently lacks only one thing: endless mode. And even now it takes a long time to finish a run, which is a doubleplus good. Kudos to the developer for his great job. One of the best rogue-like dungeon crawler games, would definitely recommend.', ""Very fun. Very frustrating too :P Learning curve isn't the steepest I've seen, but at the best, after maybe a half dozen tries if you're a pixel dungeon vet, you'll scrape by with a victory. If RNGesus blesses you, you'll die with awesome gear. Mechanically, I must say this is the smoothest and maybe most polished pixel dungeon I've played. Download and support this game, but keep an easier pixel dungeon also to get your power fantasy hit before you decide to Shatter that fantasy."", ""It's a good idea for a game, keep dying though. I run into a snake every few monsters and I can't seem to land a shot. Repeatedly get 0 damage on it and slowly die, over and over.""]"

I really like the character sprites too.', 'Its a fun game for about 5 minutes. There isnt really much balancing and picking up a different looking item just to find out its named, ""weak(insert weapon/armor/shield)"" is lack luster. Gold balancing is another issue. Picking up the increasingly rare gems doesnt feel worth it, since you could pick up a shiny rock or a triple emerald quartz square diamond and they both sell for 15 gold, while the items the shop keeper offers are low tier items that cost 10k or more. Overall its a 4 chicken feet', 'Excellent game but get ready to die! Survive the dungeons.. find loot and equip yourself for a fight.. each room a potential treasure or room of doom! Find the store keep quickly and upgrade your gear.. potions and food.. Are you up for the challenge? Why not find out by playing Quest of Dungeons..', 'Love this game. Only complaint I have is that it scales terribly on my LG V20.

RPG Blood of Calamity,kemco.magitec.yakusai,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=kemco.magitec.yakusai&hl=en&gl=us,"The special moves passed down through the bloodlines of the great clans...
Will they lead the nation to salvation or ruin...?
Introducing a hardcore Japanese-style 2D RPG which got the first place in the Google Play Top New Paid Apps in Japan!

<b>Story</b>
Hoshu Washin is a nation ruled by four clans. Kenshiro, the ruler-in-waiting of the Totsuki clan, 
prefers to spend his time chasing skirts and abhors the training he's forced to endure on a daily basis. 
One day, the Totsuki clan is attacked by mysterious beings in Oni Masks. Kenshiro vows revenge and sets off 
on a journey to bring them to justice with his faithful retainer and friend, Tatsuto.

<b>Clan Specials</b>
Performing actions like attacks and deployment changes in battle will allow you to accumulate ESP that can later be used to unleash powerful special moves known as Clan Specials. If used effectively, the multiple Clan Specials available to each character can exhibit a number of different effects and are sometimes enough to push even the most powerful Yokai to the brink.

<b>Stat Boosts</b>
You can choose which stats you'll boost with the TP you earn from battles and which of your character's abilities 
you'll choose to augment. The degree at which you boost a stat impacts the skills (Kiho) you'll ultimately learn, so it's wise to take a balanced approach to their distribution.

<b>Mandara and Deployment</b>
Though the order of turns is ultimately decided by each character's speed, a character can be turned counterclockwise after performing an action in battle. You can also place Mandara, special panels that will allow you to boost your stats and/or abilities. Using Mandara and deployment changes effectively can often be the key to emerging victorious in battle.

<b>Quests</b>
There are a number people in need of your assistance in the Hoshu Washin’s many towns and villages. Talk to as many people as possible and accept the quests they offer you. Doing so will earn you wonderful rewards and possibly much, much more...

<b>Basic System Information</b>
- Character name changes: unavailable
- Equipment slots: weapon, armor, ornament x2
- Save slots: 8
- In-game purchases: available
*While in-app-purchase content requires additional fees, it is not necessary for finishing the game.
*The actual price might differ depending on the region.

My advice is to have a second person, who can properly spot and correct these kinds of mistakes.', ""It's a good game but sometimes there are bugs and glitch"", 'Controls are too sticky', ""Get rid of that autosave part, I had no choice but to delete my data and cache after being unable to get rid of the black screen which says contact kemco.

Sigh... it's a good game though with awesome characters and storyline. Hopefully, this time I can finally complete the game."", ""The game is a bit challenging. I would've put 3 enemies in battle all the time and bosses need more Hp. Thank you guys for making this game."", ""It's a good game until I found out my side quest is incomplete!!! Help!?

Rigging the rolls like you did feels like an insult for me, so i m out. (although i understand why you did it trying to please the majority n stuff. I might do it too if i ran a business - or maybe one of the devs loves gambling too much? :P ) People who love dice usualy love fairness (fantasy gaming dice, not rl gambling dice) Bye then :)', ""This is a nice RPG game but I only ha e one request if you don't mind, can you increase the spawn rate of the shards instead of it being like a 1% chance, and a 5%chance in some areas, like can you go up to 10% at least for the first 3 areas after that you can switch it to the aforementioned above"", ""The concept is pretty fun and simple. I'd rate 5 stars, but I'm experiencing a pain in the rear bug that closes the game if I add poison that kills as the last monster in my chain in MP"", ""So far so good. I really like the art style. The in app purchases are a bit annoying but it isn't pay to win which I'm thankful for."", ""This game is so much fun; I was completely surprised by how much I have been enjoying Tiny Dice Dungeon. It's much more complex than it first appears, and the progression through the levels has been satisfying, at least thus far. If you ever hoped to find Pokemon Dungeon Crawler, this is the game for you! The retro graphics are very fitting for the gaming style & tone the app embodies."", 'Incredible merge of RPG and chance! I love the the fact that you have to respect the RNG. It keeps the game sooooo fresh! I just wish that there were better ways to progress in the game without spending money... Still here I am I have redownload this game 4 years after my first time, And I still love it!', ""Really fun just wish that if you hit an exact health kill on a monster roll (ex. 35 hp i roll 35 but still 2 other monsters) if it's not the last you at least have another chance to get it still some how. Like hold till after round and after exact number without a 1 or something to catch. Besides that i love this game and 1000% recommend"", ""I must admit that's the pixely approach is very cute and the game is simple to use. The game itself is just very fun too."", 'Fun and simple. Neat but sometimes aggravating combat system but fun nonetheless', 'So far so good. Needs easier menu navigation. A higher shard chance would be nice as well.', 'You have to keep at the game to realize what is in store for you next. Very neat and different, which keeps your interest levels high with all the new discoveries.', 'Love it! I bumped into this game like seven years ago and am just now coming back, starting fresh. One of the best mobile games out there!', 'This is an amazing RPG where you can defeat monsters and complete levels and... Stuff', ""Brilliant game!! I used to have this game on my old phone and when I got my new phone I got it again and it's still awesome!! Xx"", ""Fix the pvp dungeon please. That's all I ask. I can't fight anyone :("", ""Cute little pixel side dice dueler. If anything it's a little simplistic"", 'Played it in congregate a while back, really fun, though rolling 1s makes me unreasonably angry lol', ""I've redownloaded multiple times. Please add cloud save."", 'Pretty cool game with a lot of underlying mechanics', ""Always enjoyed this game have had it on 3 device's give it a try"", 'This games is great the monsters are super cute', 'It was fun until it got too hard out of no shortcoming of my own. To make it competitive, it looks I have to commit dozens of hours to repetitive gameplay to upgrade my character or pay for the uncut stones. This is pay to play. At least I found this out 4-5 hrs in and that time spent was fun. I played the flash version and gave up on that as well and now l remember why. Time to uninstall. It is games like these that tell me not to waste time on app games and play real games on PC or consoles.', 'Really fun. However, there are times where I accidentally press the sell item button for really rare items I do not want to sell, which gets pretty frustrating. For a later update an ""are you sure you want to sell this item"" message would really solve this issue.', ""The game is preatty fun, sometimes you feel like the gameplay might be unfair but it's just RNG. If you like turn base games mixt with a little DnD and a storry thats there just so the game has some what of a lineage this game will satisfy. All and all a good game, good experience worth sinking in to when you feel like doing nothing. I am going to give'it only 4 stars because the story is not what it could have been, the DnD aspect could have been exploited more, dus unveiling more game thirst."", ""You can be really strong, and consistently roll bad it seems and die. You don't feel like you progress apart from feeling like you have to spend real $$. When i first played it was fun, then I pick it up and jesus christ i cant pass levels i had no problem with."", 'Wonderful dice based rpg', 'It is good, but Kindly add a guild system where I can play with my friends.', ""Flaw in multiplayer not fixed. Everytime I go to the battle someone it crashes. The screen goes black then shuts down. Sometimes during battle. When you restart the game the last battle counts as I lost but I didn't finish the battle so how did I lost? Then I have to wait to battle again and it happens again."", '1s annoy me immensely. Only gripe with the game', ""I don enjoy this game. The mechanics are different from most mobile RPGs I've seen, and the grinding isn't that bad. However, at times the game feels rigged for both ends. Sometimes the whole match the enemies will never attack you, while in other cases your team could get blown over by 1 simple enemy just because you got 1's for everyone. If this could go away then I'll give a 4, maybe 5 stars, but for now I'll leave it at a three."", ""Excellent, I love this game. Nice graphics, gameplay and the grinding is not too tedious, it's actually quite enjoyable. Highly recommended"", ""good game so far, no issues from what I can see Edit: unfortunately editing my stars from 5 to 3, I've found this game to be play to win, although you can get uncut dice in game, you get very minimal amounts 1 or 2, I've only gotten 3 or 4 so far, so the only real way to get them is to buy them, and a large amount are a necessity for a lot of functions, if they could raise the drop rate or make the quests drop them more often, that would be great"", 'The game is fun and the music is great, but the playability is trash; the battle mechanics are widly uneven and completely up to chance. some times bosses will have 100 HP and then they will have 400 HP the next. Also, you can only go so far before you have to pay to play. Unfortunately, if you dont want to spend money, you will be stuck shortly after starting this game.', 'Cute graphics. Terrible gameplay. Rolling a 1 wastes your turn.', ""I'm experiencing a very high amount of heat from my phone as well, but that might just be because it's very old, around 7 years, but I don't remember it being this bad. It's a shame that I can't transfer my data to my newer phone, just because it doesn't use Google play services. Maybe be able to set up a password-based transfer system on top of cloud saving?"", ""This is one of those games I keep coming back to, amazing. No forced ads(optional ads aren't even that strong, not at all mandatory) and great calculated risk mechanic, although unintuitive for the younger casual player. Love the take on capturing monsters, although the lack of variety in stronger monsters is a shame, hope to see something greater in tdd2"", 'Fun game yet challenging but its challenging in a good way the only problem of the game i have is on the first roll you can get a one and its pointless to try.', ""I keep coming back to this game. I've played it years ago and find myself playing it until I delete it (usually because I need to focus on stuff irl) only to download later and get hooked all over. One of my phone favorites! I wish there were some updates but I still enjoy playing through it""]"

But the huge downside for me is the download of the game. Thie size of the download from the AppStore is something like ~ 71 MB. No problem. After starting the game it says it needs to download another ~ 1170 MB. Sure, go for it. But that second download will take hours if not days. I (re) downloaded the game yesterday. My WiFi was and is perfectly fine and I was not running any other apps on my tablet during the download. The game download gets stuck at around 10%. Every restart of the game nets me another ~3% of the download bar. so after 30-something restarts the download is finally finished. Took me hours to get to here. I start the game, want to spend some energy on World Boss - Game crashes. Restart and try again, same thing. So today I tried World Boss again, game keeps crashing! Okay, time to redownload the game.. AGAIN! And guess what, the download gets stuck AGAIN. Honestly, the game is fun. It really is. But this downloading fiasco is the worst I have ever witnessed.', 'It is a very nice and very addictive game on the downside however, if you do get a high lvl and acquire desirable summons hackers seem to be attracted. If you get hacked no real support to recover your account unless you keep track of money you spent on it ( if you did) my account got hacked 2 times should have learned my lesson after the first one', ""Good graphics, fun gameplay, clean and simple UI, no obtuse or confusing character progression/upgrade systems and many different units to play...If you can get them. Which leads to this games major problem: The 'Gacha' (the chance to obtain stronger, rarer characters or equipment) is truly awful, scam level in fact and among the worst of all gachas in that regard. Add onto this the constant pop-ups aggressively pushing absurdly over-priced packages and I can't in good conscience recommend this."", ""I really do love this game. Sometimes I find myself getting wayyy to sucked in and have to force myself away from the grind. I do have one wish tho. Another element type for Monsters. A green Earth type would be nice. We have Water, Fire, Wind, Light and Dark. You could even make it brown! There's so much potential with a new element type. New mons, new bosses, who knows...maybe even new runes. Please take this into consideration 🙏"", ""I've been playing daily since 2014, I had only 1 year pause from the game so that's still a lot of time active in the game. Despise me summoning so many light and dark scrolls in all this year's, I still didn't get any L&D Nat 5 however my husband that used to play, for a very long time, way less than me, he has one for over an year now. I play for so many years and I have 0 and I see people with 1 year old account having 2 or 3 Nat 5 L&D. Gj c2u, very nice of you."", ""Ever since the latest update, the app crashes whenever i do scenario and cairos dungeon.. arena is fine and everything else.. I'm using my hive account and i wasn't notified about any maintenances or what.. please send support. -sincerely, a summoner war veteran returnee Edit: i play in asia server and my account was created a month before the update and it was fine not until the update. BIG EDIT: I've found a solution for this problem. Simply delete 5 of your friends and go in a quiet channel."", 'Very very free-to-play friendly. One of, if not the best turn based mobile RPGs on the market. Very well established, tons of content to explore. There is always something to do. People who spend might get an upper hand in the Competitive Scene, but it is still possible to be strong and thrive without spending a single penny. Well crafted and the devs are very in with the community on a consistent basis.', 'Been playing for yrs, i love the game but things could be better, like having another tower for the people thats been playing for years so we can update our stats. Game takes up so much room on my phone. The games addicted. But i spend money and love the game. Wish we would get more things for free more often.', 'In my opinion,since we all have different thoughts,its a great game! Lots of characters to choose from,unique designs for each character,and great battle mechanics. For whoever is reading this,the game is easier if you can understand each monster you have and how their attacks have different effects. Synergy is key!', ""Excellent game once you get used to it. Don't, please don't, for the love of all thats good, don't compare yourself when starting this game to the players who have been playing for years. Competitive free to play, IF and only IF you are playing consistently. Don't expect free to play to be competitive if you only play 5-10 min a day. Awesome game otherwise. Been playing little over a month and highly recommended this game. Just keep your charge cable on standby..."", 'I love the game and been playing it since I was 7 and I am13 now but it been rlly hard for me to get good scrolls and better monster for my self. The only way to get good scrolls is if u buy them with money and as a teen like me and i dont have money like that to be buying 100 dollar bundles. So i feel like they should add more quest to get better scrolls and ruins. And keep adding events and updates. This is a very good game and I enjoy the grind but i just cant get good scrolls.', ""This game is truly incredible. There are so many things to do, you can play for hours on end. The auto battle feature make it perfect for when you're semi involved in a project of one kind or another. You can quite literally grow stronger, level up, and farm with a couple taps of the screen. On the other hand, there's a ton of engaging and challenging content for when you can give it your full attention. The fully customizable monster based gameplay allows for thousands of different strategies!"", 'This Game is so good. It will teach how to grind to do better to best and it will also teach how to be patient all the times and be responsible, in such a way on how you will spend energy and mana stone. Its not just a game their is deeper on it. Dont just stick on what you have grind more to be better at the game just like in life grind and grind until you succeed. More events to come. Thank you', 'This game has its ups and downs. The PVE based content in the game is very easy to clear once you invest time into it. Competitive is the endgame for players, and has 3 forms. Arena is ai based pvp, its broken for a long time now, everyone basically runs the same defence. Guild content is balanced, boring, but the rewards are great. RTA is real time pvp. This is THE endgame, since its the only true competitive mode. The rewards are mostly cosmetics though. As for Summoning rates... they suck', 'Great overall theres plenty of content. Suited for any type of gamer you are. Also can easily rank up in the game over time legit . No need to buy /play to win to still be competitive. 5*Community(worldwide) thats eager to help new players. Highly recommend you to start downloading! Very strat and stat orientated and can be quite the intellectuals game. Happy summoning', ""Good game. But im leaving 2 star review. The developers have left out auto farming when every other game offers it now. They don't care about your quality of life, and want you glued to their game 24/7. Moving on to calibria where there is an auto farm feature. Value my time com2us or i won't value your game."", 'I became unhealthily addicted to it, I enjoyed last fun moment today and now I declare quitting the game, I wanted transmorifigation but RTA is too tough and takes too long, also 6* monsters is hard to the point of making me lose focus of my old job, (that old job one of co workers introduce me to this game), please make it less addictive. Now I quit, I hope this is a lesson for everyone.', 'I do like this game and I want to give it more stars, but in the world arena (good will battle) I will accept an invitation for a battle and then it will say Error you will be brought to the tittle screen and then it makes me reload the whole game. I am quite annoyed and frustrated by this, so that is why it gets 3 stars for me.', ""Playing this game since beta and I've watched monster and rune drops go to an all time low it's very repetitive to get either a decent monster or runes for them...if they put a repeat button in for dungeons it wouldbe worth grinding but every single time having yo hit the button again makes for a long dragged out process that has a good possibility of not even getting anything of worth."", 'My favourite phone game. I love the variety of monsters and working out what teams work, often 3* are worth training up, not just super rare 5*s, and most 4* monsters are worth keeping. This game is pretty light on the power used to run it, updates regularly and love it enough to play on two devices. However, it keeps crashing on my tablet - which is a Huawei MediaPad T5.', 'Og player here This is the most time consuming game i ever see even if some parts can go in auto. The rune upgrading system is designed for make you upset. Not free to play at all. Highly depends rng whats make you do insane in the long run. And here i am playing this shity ass game for 4 yearhs now but why? Someone just end ny suffering at this point. Pls dont play this :(', ""Great game. You can really play however you want, but of course there's one way that let's you progress faster. People need to stop complaining about droprates because plenty of very good monsters are free, farmable, and really help you in every area of the game. Edit: contacted com2us. Crashing has been fixed. The new transmogs are nice, but please make the event end at some point so it's actually special to have them. Some monsters recieve lower stats upon awakening. Please fix this."", 'Hello com2us in need of help here. The game have a problem with me after 15 days of playing. The scenario and cairos won\'t open for me. It force closes and wastes my energy. I have already deleted the app but it\'s just the same, forces itself. A message flashes itself, it says something about a ""debugger attached"".', 'I love this game but the new update with the world arena rune is sooo dumb its just a wast money any time i want to fight my friends. For example: I would get a new rune i would like to put on my monster, so i did then time to go and fight my friends it is not on the monster and i have to put it on again and have to remove the rune i had on before with money and it is very very Annoying!!!!!! And a wast of my gems', 'Summoning sucks. I went threw over 30 mystical schrolls and a legendary schroll and only got 2 4* monsters. Wouldnt be such a bad thing except the mystical schrolls keep giving me 3* monsters that ive already summoned over and over again. I would say that maybe im unlucky but ive reset my account numourous times to find out if this was the norm and turns out it is. Overall i think this game is all about making money and they want u to spend that money in order to gain 4* or 5* monsters', ""Latest update to the old arena wrecked it. Now if some troll wants to lose on purpose 20 times my history is full of successful defences that I can't fight back and earn glory point. My arena rank is then too high for me to fight and beat anyone so my only option is to pick a few players to fight and lose making them have the same problem. This game keeps sliding down hill. Also I will not be getting the sequel to this game unless everything from this one transfers. Events still are broken too"", ""The game is a scam. Played for 5 year's to get to lvl 50 and get my first nat 5 star. Really don't recommend this game unless you have thousands of dollars to spend for nothing. Come2us is a greedy com that only care how much money they can get with the least amount of effort. Hope you give it 1star review cause that's what it's worth."", 'Everytime i click something a pop up shows up. All the new content and monsters that have been added are purely for meta cash and time wasters. for instance they installed a component to craft runes, the component drops in the same location the item it crafts into drops. on top of that you get one reward for 8 energy and 90 max energy. they added a lot of new content but you spend so much time grinding runes you have no energy for said content. which is a shame, game could have be fun.', ""Used to love game 5 stars only because people need to know if your not going to spend hundreds and thousands of $$$$ don't even download. They may have made it easyer to get scrolls witch I s what u use to obtain units they'd rates are so so low don't even want to no the light dark rates it's 50$ for 1 scrolls and u only have a 1_16 chance for a 4or 5* unit. I love the game have played 1 account since 2013 and have summoned 6 Nat 5s the rest are fusion. And only have like 450/1200 units"", ""It has been an amazing game so far have had lots of fun playing it. I have ran into a problem with the game it will open normally and do it's loading stuff and when it gets to where it says ready to start I press the screen and the game closes itself."", 'Hello com2us. I aappreciate your efforts for better arena experience but I have a problem in my runes. The problem is when I changed and fixed my runes in my monster storage it went through but when I entered world arena it did not change or update at all. Please check it com2us and I love your game.', ""Great game been playing for years. Always new things to do, and feels great to play even if you don't spend much time playing. Events are fun and plentiful. Would recommend and have to my friends. If you play make sure you invite friends in game rather than just tell them like I did.😃"", ""Getting boring. It's a really really good addictive game you won't regret playing for sure and I've actually spent money on it. But i haven't had a nat 5 in about 6 months now. I just want some new monsters to play with. I've started to look for a new game to play because im getting bored :("", ""Lovely graphics and visuals, and the gameplay was simple but masterfully addicting. Not much to do post-story, but it's definitely still worth keeping. Social levers were built into the platform so as not to be a distraction, but isn't just a waste of space either. 111% recommend."", ""This is a strategic rpg game with complex characters and gameplay designed to test your wits. It's a lot of fun and anyone can be a top player. Plus there are always events that grant you exclusive rewards so there's never a dull moment."", 'A good game for both f2p and p2p. The game is very newbie friendly and the ongoing events is pretty luxurious for players. However, only the summon rates and drop rates bottleneck the rest of the game specialty. The rate of getting good unit and good runes is quite low, which requires too much time and effort investment.', ""The game is wonderful and it has God like characters and runes, but the time it took to download and update it took 2 days. I really like it, it's just I had deleted the game twice because either an update was available but I couldn't, or I needed space. Either way I love the game. 😃😃😃"", ""It was a nice game but after 5 years of playing and still i don't have Light And Dark Natural 5 star monster.. com2us always giving you a hope in every event but still always Nat 3 star monster.. you can get LnD Nat 5 monster if you purchase to them..so for me its ok hehe..if i don't have money to buy the packages hehe.. but still THANK YOU COM2US because i found some good friends in my journey of playing this game..keep up the good job..GOD BLESS"", 'This was a ok game but now i cant play i have perfect connection running at 60mbps and every time i load this game it goes to a black screen for 5 mins then sais network cannot be found not the first issue iv had with the game either overall a great game when it works tho. The biggest issue with this game by far is its storage space and the fact that you cant move it to sd card especially with thousands of texture files.', ""This game sux. It can't remember passwords.

I've ground through  all the enemies a dozeb times. Every tine I load the save it resets all the enemies. After defeatibg the last wave, either the boss doesn't appear or the bridge leading to the boss doesn't. If the game were fixed I'd rate 5/5...otherwise 3/5 for an incomplete, all be it fun experience."", 'The game is really fun to play. I have enjoyed the challenges so far. However, I am fighting the conquerer right now and the game just goes to a black screen and will not let me do anything.', 'Seriously disappointing. The game kept freezing right after Aegon talked with his grandfather. I tried starting a new game but it just kept crashing to the main menu. I e-mailed a complaint which was ignored.                OK it turns out I can fix those problems by stopping the app, but it is still buggy and the support was non-existant so I can only up it to 3.', 'Firstly, this game does not have a good story. The writing and characters are banal and downright insulting to the intelligence. The characters and at least part of the story are a blatant copy of the ghostbusters movies. The combat -could- be enjoyable, but is stymied by a very slow moving enemy turn sequence. You can touch the screen to make it faster, but its still slow. This is how you make a short game seem like it is a long game. The dice rolls are dumb. The worst part about it, however, is how it starts out easy, then two levels in it drills you with nigh impossible battles, leaving the player to wonder if they should spend real money to buy the equipment needed to not have to grind each fight, despite the fact that this game costs real money to start with. Every level, you can visit the games store, which is populated with items that cost JUST above how much gold you can collect, all the way up  to about ten times that amount. They even have a sword of cheating for 25000 gold. The most I had after scrimping for three levels was 2000. That bought literally nothing but a lowest tier item.  And then it glitched on me.', 'Can not move between menu options to select from start screen. Cursor on screen like I should have a mouse. Tried with stylus too.', 'Not too bad of a game here except for random crashing and/or freezing issues throughout game. (Device: Nvidia Shield K1)', ""Fun when it works but I've had lots of problems with it randomly restarting, sticking on characters, etc"", 'Good game', ""This game is fun and I'm enjoying it overall, but it has a couple of problems - the UI needs to be tweaked and some elements need to be adjustable. Many interactions are way too sensitive whereas others are not nearly sensitive enough. My recommendation: get the game, it's worth it - I can't stop playing...  EDITED: The game is fun, though IMHO, too short.  But, I'm starting again on a harder difficulty."", 'Linear storyline. Game Play is slow and predictible. If you load auto save game it skips forward to next chapter. ""Dungeons"" are just a few very basic rooms. No random drops. You always get the same gear and level up at a set rate. No choice on char upgrades. Very little replay value.', 'Save and quit to main, load and load auto save game, and the game starts from the next chapter,  all characters will be LV up automatically, just wonder, have you guys ever tested it before you release it?', 'Love everythn about it', ""It is a fun turn based strategy game. It is at least a 4 star game if I didn't keep losing my save file and going back to old levels.  Until an update to fix save issues I cant play the same levels over and over."", 'Game looks a lot of fun but it locks up on every autosave shame.', 'Game is unplayable in current form.  Crashes at first auto save during the tutorial.  Waste of money and time.', 'Very fun. If you are into turn based games you should dig this game', ""Nice try guys but the game needs more testing before being ready for 4.3. Game freezes and loss of levels for characters when going back to an earlier save. And don't even go there with the save system. Game should be Ok after two or three more updates..."", 'This is a great game. Amusing, east to pick up and play anytime. Lots of secrets to be discovered making you think more about the game other than fighting. Few minor issues with store (Buying coins) at the moment if/ when delt with i would happily give 5 stars', ""Nice little turn based dungeon crawler, graphics are actually good, combat mechanics are decent,and nice scripting... However the bloody thing keeps crashing, and would be nice if an error report could be sent to fix it. 3 stars till it's fully fixed."", 'This kind of reminded me of a cross between a dungeon crawler and final fantasy chronicles.  Couple of small bugs found but no show stoppers so far.  Having fun with it.', ""I really think this could be a great game , but it's unplayable because of the constant screen rotation. Regardless of the way I hold my phone, the screen rotates the opposite way in-game. Needs to have a lock screen rotation option and I would love this game."", 'It does not install in my nexus 4. Refund until it works properly.', ""Update 2014.04.09 Awesome support from Dev, highly recommend this app! Update 2014.04.08 Hi, Have tried to contact you via the specified website but it has not contact us option. Have sent you a message via Facebook but have had no reply. Please help.

Well done and keep this series coming.', 'same thing over and over...ughh', 'I have only played 10 minutes and I am already hooked. Must have for the price.', ""I want to like this game, I really do. it's a standard premise, a party of \nadventurers going through a dungeon, looking for secrets and treasures, \ndefeating monsters along the way, with turn-based strategic combat. It's a \ntried-and-true genre. What holds it back is glitchy gameplay, often \ncorrupted savegames, and a not-quite-polished UI. On top of that the \nbattles get grindy very quickly. Even if you have a perfect strategy you \nhave to rely on good di rolls. If you get a few unlucky rolls in a row, you \nmight as well restart the battle because you won't make it to the end. This \nmakes the battles very grindy, more of a chore to restart over and over and \nhope for a better outcome."", 'Slow..Slow.. and Boring with no excitement', 'Excellent turn based strategy, reminds me of board game hero quest.

The game has also lost its fun factors after the recent update. Earlier in the story mode, you were free to select your team, but now, you are stuck with iron man, captain America and black widow. Maybe you could remove this.', ""2 years ago, this game used to be considered as one of the best online mobile games. I'm really sad and disappointed at the poor direction the game is heading to, especially with its most recent updates. In terms of character & game design, this game is brilliant. Sadly, not much can be said about actual gameplay. The developers need to plan updates carefully before releasing them and should make sure these updates involve meaningful changes involving gamemodes, not just boring repetitive ones."", ""This used to be my favourite game ever. I played for hours every day. But then the updates started changing and I stopped playing often. I maybe started playing about 2 times a week for about 10 minutes. It started to get worse so I deleted it for a while and download again today and my god. They have absolutely ruined everything in the game. I'm not mad, I'm just disappointed. Oh wait never mind, I am mad. Just make the game good like it used to be, then I'll be back. Please,😔 Goodbye......"", ""Its a very nice game , i enjoy it playing. But the game won't let me connect to my Facebook account, whenever i click on connect to Facebook button instead of showing log in option it shows forgot password and creat new account page. Please fix the issue as i could not connect to my friends. Edit:- Thank u guys for resolving the Facebook login problem. 5 stars from me. Have a great day."", ""One of the few F2P games that actually gives away items to keep loyal players interested and able to keep up with P2P players. The developers are more than generous and if you're patient, the daily gems stack up fast! It's very possible to gain just about everything in this game if you put the time in and that's not saying one has to put in a ton of time. However, as with all things, there are ways to pay and get things faster but it doesn't impact the PvP aspects much."", 'Decent game but not free to play. You need to spend about 30 dollars a month. But reason for my low score is that as of a patch about 3 months ago the loading screens on several game modes went from 20 to 30 seconds to 2 to 5 minutes. This makes the game extremely annoying to play and I am calling it quits after waiting several months for them to fix.', ""Improvements need to be made to all the game modes. As it stands now we have 200+ characters in game but literally no where to use any of them!!!!! It's gotten to the point that the characters are the only content in the game that is really worth experiencing. Please allow us to use our characters in meaningful game modes with good rewards."", ""They completely destroyed the game with the 5.8 update. Players have been asking for new things to do for years, and all Netmarble did was nerf the top characters to make the existing modes harder so it takes us longer to complete them. That's not what we want! This is not a fix, it's lazy and manipulative. Netmarble only cares about money, not its player base, and I'm never spending money on this game again. AVOID"", 'Always disconnect from server. Come on!!! I pay for this game!! Fix it!!! It not bcoz of wifi. Coz its only happens to some character especially premium character (New review) Mode that should be improve is World Boss Invasion and Giant Boss Raid. This 2 mode always lagging and disconnect from server. Other mode so far so good.', ""This is (or was) my favorite Marvel game ever made, but the devs keep ruining it every update. taking away things I enjoy and replacing it with something I'll do once or twice and never again (ie. Story mode) I've spent a lot of money in the game which I never do, but they really need to start listening to players feedback. Make abx and alliance conquest better, fix the balance with older characters. Make bleed useful or get rid of it.. etc"", ""I've playing for a few months now and I love it, the character selection is constantly growing with the updates witch gets me excited to see if one of my favorites has joined the games universe. Only complaint is the character selection is small at the moment & focused more on recent characters but that's to be expected and I only hope that future updates bring more classic characters & costumes. The game play is also unique & fun in my opinion of course. One love all."", ""At this point feels like pure bait n switch, the changes to game modes and direct nerfs to characters after you spend money on them. Introducing rules then changing them 2 months later after ppl spend money....used to enjoy this game as of 2/12 update doesn't even seem like the same game anymore. Will not spend money on this game again due to these predatory practices."", ""What the heck is this new update?! The new way of playing the story is trash! You can't even choose your own characters! I enjoyed the old way much, much more. If you want to play a game where you do not choose your characters in the story mode and it has multiple modes this is the game for you. I only put 2 stars because this only applies to story mode on no other mode except legendary battle."", 'The game is decent enough but some modes are a boring slog or just broken and pay to win like timeline battle. But the one star is given purely for the fact the developers are utter liars and thieves. And just plain dont listen to the community. Example, i purchased something and never got part of it. I contacted support and they tell me their ""logs"" say i havent completed the content to unlock the stuff and received everything. Which is just a flat out lie. and they refuse to refund too.', ""Update 5.8 is terrible. It's a gamble game, everything is so random. I would prefer to spend 10.000 crystals to get the card I want than spend 670 crystals to maybe get a premium card or garbage. Please fix that, it's so frustrating. The same with CTPs, ccf drops, every chest, almost everything in this game is 10% strategy, ability and log every day, the other 90% are just luck or spend money. Luck is supposed to be 10% of a game! To play poker you need less luck than mff!"", 'After recent updates, the game has lost its fun factor. Most reviews have already covered the issues. One additional issue that I dislike is the removal of the option of one-handed mode. I can understand this being disabled in some game modes, but is another change in a long list of changes that have made the game far less enjoyable for me personally.', 'Tons of heroes, power ups/equips, and modes. Has depth, but the menus are terrible to navigate, terrible at teaching you even the basic or useful parts of the game. This game is complex and doesnt hold your hand at all, but while the system and mechanics being complex adds depth to the game which is great, the more complex a game is, the more advanced the guide should be to teach you. Maintenance times are long compared to other games I play like Duel Links, which is further irritating.', ""Please try to listen to the community. These new update changes have triggered a lot of players, go read some posts on the forums, people ranging from star agents , your big spenders to f2ps, complaining about the changes you've made by reading the patch notes. I love this game, but if you could just play your own game you would know. Nerfing the toons is worst. Even worse when the nerfed character is none other than Doctor Strange(most of them have ctp of rages). Please listen to the community"", 'New update ruins core mechanics of the game and makes it very unenjoyable. It takes away the hard work people have put into building up characters and makes favourite game modes unplayable. The so called improvements to game modes are not improvements at all and there is no changes to rewards which all players want. The developers are out of touch with the community and have ruined the game. 0/5 - Do not recommend', ""I have been playing this game since day 1 but every update, the gap between a whale and a casual player changes to point that it is necessity for you to spend real money, on top of that the devs even won't listen to the community, update after update the game becomes difficult making free to play players losing their interest unlike it once was. Good luck NETMARBLE, you'll going to lose a great amount of players in the game. Unless you'll reconsider to listen to what the community has to say."", ""It would be nice if you guys made an update where the new story mode & the older story mode were optional. This new story mode is not very fun at all. Takes to long per mission and your not allowed to skip those really long cut scenes. Also only being able to use Black Widow, Captain America, and Ironman sucks. I have all 3 of them maxed out but in stpry mode they're terrible"", 'Gotta say, downloaded this because Contest of Champions pissed me all the way off and off the bat 3 5 star heroes including one of my choosing and so many free rewards it was not only mind-blowing but down-right amazing. On top of that the graphics are superb, gameplay is fun, the banter between characters while you play is neat, and the story is quite good. This game surprised and blew me away great job Devs and thanks for giving us all the great free perks from the start seriously, thank you.', ""It's good game and has a lot of good quest. Only the last 2 or 3 update it's kind of controversial to the marvel comics fan and a lot of changes. May be the developer could evaluate more deeply on how to carried on this game to become a more accurate and fun gameplay, story, and character updates. Also, appreciates the hard work on adding new characters, but may be in the future you could be more accurate to the comics or at least made the characters more conforming. Thanks."", ""Thanks for the respond, I hope the dev team never do a things like that again. You should really fair, focus on new player and also veteran. In order to attract them you must make them feel comfortable with the system then they will have willing to spend. Don't trap new player otherwise this game will be death... And don't overreact to the whaler, I know they spend money a lot but without new player this game will not be expanding"", ""-This game is VERY pay to win,💲💲💲 -I dislike how some game modes/nodes are limit to 5 per day. That really sucks bc I wanna do more, in my opinion it shouldn't have a limit. -INVENTORY space gets filled quick and you have to BUY space, I have alot of things that are useless to me give us the option to spend gold to increase. Graphics ✔,Grind is 💯, rewards not worth it. RNG ALWAYS WIN!!."", 'Not as much fun as it used to be... The game has been TOTALLY changed. All the missions are very hard to play and the heroes have become too puny. I do not get a sense of playing a super hero any more but it rather feels like I am playing a a weakling unit. In order to make it through missions one has to buy uniforms and expend money because there are so many stars and masteries for everything that there is never an end to trying to get your character to a decent shape.', 'Really nice games including features , moves , and characters it felt so realistic playing it . The game is of large download size but after playing the game I realized that my this much data was not a waste of time . If you are playing first time it will be a bit boaring because of dialogues but then after sometime it turns interpreting and then more and more....... this way the game becomes awesome I love playing this game so much and can t stop playing it once download this must have part --2', 'I love this game but as updates are coming the game is becoming more complicated and difficult as boss are very strong and level 70 characters available to defeat them but to rank up character many resources are needed which are very difficult and time consuming to collect When updating a character from sixty to seventy many resources are needed which are very scarce and time consuming to collect Its my request that game should give vast number of black anti matter etc', ""NM, you all are constantly ruining the game with these latest updates, the new story mode sucks and it is hard especially since we can't pick any character we want to play with. NM, another thing that really upsets me is that ya'll have been making characters available in the shop by us having to spend crystals in most of these recent updates such as Taskmaster, Viper and etc. NM, rewards are too difficult to win. Please go back to the old original method."", ""The game is literally unplayable for me. I have this glitch that says there are files downloading, which the game downloads, unzips, then… repeats. I thought the new update would get rid of the glitch, but apparently not. And if you're wondering why I know the cycle doesn't stop; I've left it for over an HOUR to update, only to come back and find it stuck in the loop. Please fix this bug ASAP. I've been an off-again on-again player for almost 4 years now, and I'd hate to permanently quit."", ""Take my advice don't get it it takes up so much space I have a lot of space in my tablet I rated 1 star because it takes up too much space I get that they have to add it updates but still can someone figure out something that can lower the memory on the game like seriously why on Earth can someone figure out how to make a game which that can is high quality but takes up almost no memory k I have nothing against the game but can't Engineers figure it out please tell me someone can do that ok bye!"", ""I really enjoy this game style. This is the first MARVEL game that isn't turn-based, so I really enjoy this. Plus, there's the fact that you can change which character you play as, and let's just say that there's almost every hero in the MU. Very impressed!"", ""Tier 3 updrade is too difficult ... probably we need lot of time ...... a game in digital era must be not so long satisfy the player in less time .... genrally students doesn't have too much time to play the games ... at the tier2 I had to uninstall the game because I don't have too much time to spent with this .... I requests the developers to make changes in tier3 upgrade pattern...thank you"", 'I cant play story mode ever since the update. There is a time that im playingl story mode, then there is one mob that cant be killed. I exited the story mode and tried to continue but it always goes back to the scene where there is the stupid mob that cant be killed. Its always there forever.', 'after the change to the game modes the gameplay becamed more dull and boring. Most non meta games are removed, mods that allowed you to gather resourses like gold and tickets are gone to. This change made the game overgrind that i see no point because at this rate it will get closed faster then you can get all the heroes you want to the levels you needed.', 'Each update makes the game more and more garbage as the designers screw the players more and more. The boss fights basically are impossible as you do less and less damage as you should even with your most powerful tier 3 characters who are beefed up. The bosses are able to do random cut scenes which screws any actions the players already initiate. The bosses are able to do multiple one second kills out of the blue. You find yourself waiting for the game to even target the villians as you pound away at the keys. fail netmarble. fail.', 'Really really enjoyable. It never gets old. I really enjoy games like these because I love seeing how far I come when I sweep masses of enemies while taking virtually no damage. Really rewarding and satisfying and I recommend it.', ""Clearly made by fellow True Believers. 'Nuff said. I removed my 2 star review after they stopped forcing us to play Danger Room every single day. There were a few other issues that stemmed from that but they're a non-factor now. It's back to being an enjoyable game. There's even a new story!"", ""From 5* for literally 4 years and now down to 2*....i love the game and have had been playing for many years....but this last update kick a pain in the ass...i paid though...but this is too much for f2p's...there's almost no chances to keep up the events so forth...kindly lookout the forum, community voices to this....."", ""this good game used to work fine all these years but it won't work as of feb.12, 2020 on chromebook after the update. Feb 21, 2020 thanks for the reply , i am disappoint to hear that your company won't support this device. i invested money on this game because it worked on chromebook.""]"

On my first playthrough, I had just left Dantooine, and something strange happened. When I arrived at Yavin, everyone on the ship except Carth and T3 had disappeared. When I tried to exit the ship, they were the only ones that were available as companions. The slots for the others were just empty boxes that showed the caption, ""I\'m broken. So very broken."" If I tried to add the blank boxes to my party, the game crashed. Please fix.', ""Pretty darn fun. This game is a huge blast from the past, I've spent hours with this game on PC, and the WHOLE GAME is on mobile. It's super impressive to me that they got the entirety of this (for the time it came out) huge game on mobile. Just like any port would though, it has its issues. A lot of little issues, it's not super comfortable to play. Especially the turret mini games. But all in all a good experience."", ""Better graphics than the original, it plays really well. Easy to use. Yavin Station is included. I've played this thousands of times on the original Xbox, and I feel like it was the same thing, which is amazing. I just wish you could have different control settings. I had an extremely hard time with Swoop racing, and a hard time on the Ebon Hawk's turrets. Overall I'm extremely satisfied. Thank you for not messing up my nostalgia lol."", ""In a lot of little ways this game has issues with controls, and camera...you have to play with the control sensitivity until it's right, but no major flaws. Otherwise it's an excellent game that holds up well despite not being originally meant for this platform and being as old as the original title is. Would love to see it's sequel be released if they did as well they did here."", 'I haven\'t experienced an issue yet, and I love the game. Honestly, it\'s more of a nostalgic time-waster. For my purposes, it works well. My one serious concern is that Google Security has this listed as having an ""Unverified developer"". It would ease some concerns if that was handled and the developer became verified.', ""I loved this game on xbox, one of my all time favourites. It's pretty near brilliant on mobile too, it's just a little difficult to control movement. You have to swipe up to move forward but to get your character to run your finger will be at the very top of the screen. Sort the control issues out and this would be a five star game, no problem"", 'Bro its just like when i played it on the original Xbox as a kid. Its action packed. I get to customize my character and make choices. The boss battles are outstanding. And the puzzles are so fun. I played it and beat it and trust me its not an easy game. It keeps you on your toes and you have to be prepared for every fight. I love it.', ""I am generally satisfied with this port, except for one thing.SWOOP RACES. Contols are extremely uncomfortable, why couldn't you try to emulate keys or at least increase the times to beat.It is impossible to beat some tracks, because, obviously, touchscreens have no feedback unlike actual buttons, so it is unfair to leave the same requirements. To make matters worse, the pause button doesn't work during the race, so you can't even load a save and are obliged with a chore to continue a lost race"", 'Dude i love the game but i hate these game breaking bugs. Cant load up chewy or canderous into my party. Just got canderous and its time to go to daviks estate and escape taris. But hes broken, so very very broken. So is chewy. Its poop. This bug needs a fix. I just had to delete my whole list of saves because they were all corrupt and i didnt know. First time literally doing every quest on taris and it breaks to where i cant get off taris.', ""Can't give it anymore than this because 3/4 saved games wouldn't load, the only one was an autosave that set me back 1.5 hours in the sewers. Don't know if I want to continue if this is going to happen anymore. The game itself is good, easily 5 stars. 10 dollars is a little pricy for a twenty year old game. Update: no saved games will load now, only autosave? Wth."", 'One of the best Star Wars games ever, huge arcing story, large worlds to explore, lots of choices to make in the game and plot twists, OK touch controls but the game supports controllers too, runs very well I have never had a crash, bug or any problem so far and I have played many hours. If you like star wars or rpgs in general you will love this, and if you do the sequel knights of the old Republic 2 is available on pc, which I would also checkout with the restored content mod on steam or gog.', ""CANNOT COMPLETE GAME! Not many faults in the game but there are a few... Constant crashes for a start! Ebon Hawk turret mini games bug from time to time not allowing me to look up or down. Every now and then my screen will go black but can still hear the game playing and can still run so touch is registering. Leading to the next fault, touch NOT registering at times, just randomly? (Not my phone as tough still works to close the app and use others). And achievements aren't completing properly..."", ""Controls in Ebon Hawk Turrets are Impossible. Not only it's difficult to control, you can't fire at the same time you're turning, so you have to stop turning in order to fire. How can you hit a moving Target like that? I love this have and have played it on PC multiple times, but on Android I cannot get passed this stage because of the terrible controls..."", ""The game is beautiful, plays great but there's an issue where the game stops in a loading screen, it will load to a certain point and then stop without cause or reason. Any chance taken by the Devs to resolve this issue will be appreciated and make for a better experience for the consumer, i dont want to uninstall the app because it's unplayable."", 'First time playing KOTOR, and this mobile version is not a bad way of playing it! Very intuative controls, and it has the DLC right off the bat like the updated Xbox One versions. Only issue I had was the infamous ""I AM BROKEN I AM VERY VERY BROKEN"" glitch where I lost half my crew, resolved by reloading a save game a minute earlier, did not reoccur. Other than that, fantastic game, just finished my first run. Kudos to BioWare for making this incredible RPG.', ""First of all, I'm playing on a Samsung S8+. This is a phenominal game, and the mobile port is nothing short of excellent. I've so far not seen a single crash, and no issues that affect gameplay at all, and I've played several hours. It does have small graphical bugs, characters with spontanious blackface sometimes occur after tabbing out and back to game, but overall it plays wonderfully. The notorious Swoop race had me worried but after beating it first try i can confirm its perfectly doable."", ""Luckily I didn't spend money on this game. It was free on play pass. And it was great until I caught up to all the negative reviews. After a certain point... It freezes at 25% loading. 23 hours in with no fault... And then infinity of of loading screen. Don't buy it. And if it's free on play pass... Don't expect to get beyond 50% of the game before it crashes and you can't do anything but start over from the beginning and relive the horror."", ""I love the game. Graphics are good. The only bad thing is whenever I try to open the game and continue my playthrough it never loads up the game. It goes to the loading screen but there's no progress whatsoever and the only option is to start the game all over again."", 'The game was very fun and enjoyable, but after my first playthrough, loading in from the menu would always take me to dantooine, which I am not complaining about as it could be fixed by either heading to the Ebon Hawk or reloading the save. This also allowed me to get a lightsaber on the first planet and make the early game a lot easier.', ""It pains me to give this game a bad review, as it's a great port and game... But I recently found out that this game requires internet connection after a period of time without connection to verify the licence, this happens repeatedly every couple of weeks. Other then that issue though, the game is very enjoyable and I'd recommend it to any Star Wars fan, unless you're concerned of the issue above."", 'If only it would stop crashing during load. Running on a Galaxy S10, and twice now it will not load games previously started. The first time, I was not that far into the game, so I reinstalled and restarted. This time, I am a bit further, and here I am, with a crash during loading a game....just sits there doing nothing. Hopefully the developer is feverishly working on a fix, as it seems this is not that uncommon. I was a huge fan of KOTOR 2, and was looking forward to playing this.', ""KotOR is a 5 star game, in my opinion, this port has some issues though. Controls are a bit awkward, but at least it looks like they tried. The big issue is all the technical problems. About one in twenty saves is corrupt and won't load, for example. Not TERRIBLE, but should really be fixed."", 'This is a great game! It has everything from the old game, of course i went lightside all the way!lol , the only thing that bugs me is the movement controls, you cant look up or down,not sure if the old one was like that plus the control stick isnt tight meaning my thumb has to go to the top of the screen to run. Other than that its the same awesome game, enjoy!', ""I would give this port a better rating, but it's only a decent port for touchscreen devices. It's the same game that we all loved, and for a phone the port is solid. When you play it on a chromebook is when the big issues start flaring up. The inability to look right, for instance. I can look left as long as I want, just not right. Finicky camera panning when I'm trying to engage combat, no hotkeys to speed things up. Play this game. Just not on a laptop. Also, KOTOR 2 port please."", ""I absolutely love this game. However, the controls for the swoop racing are absolutely abysmal. I just don't see how it is possible to actually beat the swoop races on tatooine without proper controls. I've tried probably three dozen times and I can't for the life of me get under 25 seconds. You need a 23 or 22 second race to win. It's incredibly frustrating. They need to insert a slide at the bottom to control the swoop bike. Please fix this!"", 'Wonderfully done mobile port that supports mods and controllers! Honestly, with native widescreen support and great controller support this is the best version to play if you want a console like experience of the classic but also want to install mods. Trying to play the PC version with a controller sucks compared to this. Great job to the team that worked on this mobile version!', ""This game is worth every penny spent on it. If you have a Chromebook you can get it for free, but it's worth the 10 dollars. I also recommend getting it for $10 on Steam as well if you'd like to try a modded experience of the game too. Star Wars KOTOR and KOTOR II are my favorite video games of all time. My only issue with the Android version is a random save glitch that happens occasionally but they are trying to fix it. I 100% recommend this to anyone who likes RPG's."", 'What a disappointing port, they took a good game that was rough around the edges and somehow made it rougher. I\'ll start with the simpler bugs. First off there\'s a common problem with black screens, they require a reboot or loading an old save in my case. Secondly the controls, walking around is ok but the swoop is unplayable and my God the turret sections are ridiculous due to the asinine decision to not include a separate ""fire"" button. Worth noting also is how my save eventually corrupted...', ""An excellent port, depending on the device you're using. I have the Razer phone 2. So this runs on a beautiful 144hz display with no stuttering. However touch controls won't translate very well for racing/turret sections, and menu items can literally be unreadable icons appear to fit your screen size. Even on my phone this made menu items smaller than the letters on my keyboard. Other than this a perfect port of early 2000's Xbox classic, I hope they pick up Kotor 2 soon"", '99.99% as good as original game! I feel like there are less loot drops in total but the quality of each drop you get is on average better. Not missing anything though, all weapon and armor sets available. Eagerly awaiting kotor 2 on the play store!!!!!!!!', ""Very fun, the touch controls are implemented well into it. The only downside is the loading glitch that the game seems to be well known for. The only real solution I have found is to have multiple save files within a few minutes of each other. I don't know why the game does this, or why it hasn't been fixed, but so far, this has been the best solution. Other than that, this game is still good, it's the exact same from it's original counterpart."", ""Excellent game, and a mostly excellent port for Android. However I've encountered one pretty serious bug near the end of the game, where high level Jedi companions have their maximum Force Points reduced to almost nothing. I would easily give this 5 stars, but this bug makes the endgame way harder than it's supposed to be, knocking off a star."", 'Good port overall. Controls are a bit rough for some of the side games like swoop racing but alright overall. Only real bug I\'ve seen is with quick save. Occasionally it will create a 2nd quick save file that won\'t load and puts it in the 1st slot which breaks the ""continue"" feature. Manually Loading the 2nd quicksave in the list and then deleting the other fixes it for a while but it\'ll happen again after a while.', ""It's an awesome game. It's the best Star Wars game that I've ever played and my favorite game. There are only a few minor bugs and glitches in the game. Some of the parts are hard and sometimes frustrating, but I like it. A word of advice for fellow players: Always manually save after a large event in the game. Keep a backup save just in case. Definitely worth it. On a scale of 1-10, the amount I want kotor 2 on mobile is 12."", 'Great game brought to the mobile.

Well done creators!"", 'It was all great, but for some reason, it seemed far too quick for me. I enjoyed it, but I feel like the ending was too.. sudden? It makes me feel like I purchased a quick game :(', ""Singular. Let me tell you, I've played a lot of games like these - read a lot of books, told and heard interactive stories for all my life. And this is the best one I've played so far."", ""This was so amazing! You're choices really matter and I really grew attached to the main characters. First I played as a good character then I tried playing as an evil maniac but near the end I was presented with a powerful moral choice and I couldn't be evil anymore. So worth what I paid, this is my favorite author of interactive stories."", ""I liked it. I completed the story with the cloud of robots at the beach. It's well-written, intelligent, can sometimes humorous, but the different story choices at the beginning don't change gameplay much. It is Much better than choice of wizards, which I uninstalled after the third chapter."", ""This is one of the best text based games I've played on hear, you get very invested in the characters and there are plenty of interesting choices so you don't get borad whith a wall of text, all in all it was so much fun!"", 'An amazing game/book. Full of interesting choices and topics, with ample variety between playthroughs.', ""This was and still is my favorite game but I'm currently dying of frustration because a new update just came out which brutally destroys the controls. Swiping sideways on a choice now selects it, and it's really sensitive, which means that every time you put down you phone and your hand brushes against the screen or whatever (which should be allowed because this an essentially turn-based game that doesn't require quickly reacting to anything) you will unintentionally select a choice which could have major game-altering consequences and often requires resetting your entire save file and starting over to get back on track to what you were trying to do furthermore, to add insult to injury, every time you try to select a choice the normal way by tapping on it before hitting enter, the game plays an obnoxious animation advertising ruining any possibility of ignoring the thing to try to save myself the stress of thinking about it, and it blocks you from scrolling when you're touching a choice, which makes things really difficult when there's a long list of choices where you need to scroll to see them and not a lot of text to touch to navigate. There is no setting to opt out of this misery, and believe me, I check every three pages just in case. If I could bring myself to I would give this game one star just for this update. I can't, in honesty, because it really is an incredible game besides this part, but I seriously recommend you save yourself the endless frustration by waiting until this is fixed before you get invested in this game."", ""Started playing this two days ago and it's all I've been thinking about since then. The choices are weighty, and the emotions are richly written, while maintaining humor & frankness that won me over instantly. It's wildly replayable- I've played maybe 6 times already and it doesn't get old. I'm already thinking about seeing what I can do differently that I haven't already seen. My only complaint is, the game forces binary gender choices: my robot can be ungendered but I can't be, which sucks."", ""I normally dont write reviews but I just have to share how amazing this story was. You really change potential outcomes drastically with your choices, and you can see how much each one matters. I was hanging on every chapter on an emotional rollercoaster until the very end. Hands down, BEST Choice Of game I've played yet. I would definitely recommend this to anyone. Worth every cent."", 'Absolutely wonderful writing. Very fun for any who is a fan of isaac asimov. Robots are cool. And this Choose Your Own Adventure game is just as cool.', ""Best so far, but I can't take it too seriously with all the references to video games and such. Also death shouldn't require a restart, I'm tired of having to speedrun trying to get back to where I was, you could easily program a checkpoint everytime a chapter ends. Still, the game is pretty good."", ""I've played many of the games here and I've rarely seen such a high rating so I finally decided to purchase even though I found the price a bit steep. And I was just... whelmed. The game is not bad per se, it's just meh. The working feels a bit rushed at places (especially in the second half of the game), most of the characters don't really have distinct voices and most of the relationships you build seem forced with unrealistic interactions. Again, it's not all bad, and the idea is very interesting but, especially after all the amazing reviews, I was expecting something so much more than what I got (also longer)."", ""Characters were introduced very quickly, and barely knowing anything you had to decide what your character's relationship with them is. It time skips a lot, which I'm not a big fan of. The writing style is just 'okay, you did this, now this happens.' Hardly and emotional or detailed writing, but this is just about personal tastes. If you like a clean cut, clearly written story, I would reccomend it. There are no clear grammatical or spelling problems and it has a good concept."", ""Absolutely amazing, tons of replay value. The game creator really knows what he's doing to create an immersive experience; you really feel like your choices matter and there are so many different endings! I highly recommend Choices of Magics by the same author too, both brilliant games. (:"", ""One of the best text based games I've ever played. There are so many different paths you can take just by changing one or two decisions. It is well worth the 6 bucks that it costs to have it. After all, that's the same price as a small meal at some place like McDonalds or taco bell"", ""Warning: Do not play this game if you are feeling lonely or in a melancholic mood. I couldn't even bring myself to go through the game getting the crueler achievements after playing through the Empathy route, finding love with a robot companion and raising my original robot like my child the whole way."", ""Liked the depth and quality of the writing. No other choice of games game has that extensive consequences. Didn't care much about the theme so I had trouble getting into it. Also, I think the price is steep. You only realize the length when replaying the story and trying to get all achievements."", ""This was such a well wrote story, I lived each of the characters in their own way and the ending I got on my first play through almost brought tears to my eyes, it is definitely worth the money. This story had a large impact on me, my most favorite of all I've read so far"", ""Exceptionally well written and a great example of why interactive novels are such an engaging medium. Story contains numerous paths and you'll need to repeat the beginning a couple of times to reach all of them. More than worth it, I couldn't put this down."", ""I've played almost all interactive story games and think this is the best one! Although it could have images and less text per page, I felt the story really changes with each decision, the story is interesting and full of ethical choices, well written and I had fun with the achievements too!"", ""Choice of Robots fearlessly dives into the conversation we need to have about Robotics, Artificial Intelligence and Human-Robot Interactions. It is an incredible narrative written by a remarkable author who has clearly put a great deal of thought into the story's structure and its reactions to your choices. In short, Superbly written. Strongly recommended."", 'By far one of the best choice of games ever written. This one was the first i ever played, the nerdy jokes and detail in the choices was freaken awesome. I would say anyone who is considering trying choice of games should give this one a shot.', ""Just one of my faves. Respectably lengthy, but doesn't drag.

An interesting story with some replayability.', ""The ending was not satisfied,at least you should let's us see from the robot eyes what happen after you die what they do to it! anyway it's was a good game..."", ""This really is the definition of choose your own ending.

Star traders lead to me downloading the rest of the brothers games and when I found out they were also on steam I had to get it on my laptop too! I Jacob T.

TRY Star traders or one of their others games once minimum. ~JH"", 'Ok i have given this game a fair chance and tried playing through multiple times. The odds are incredibly stacked agaisnt you. You are constantly getting attacked and making repairs all the while losing profits and crew members. You cant play for extended periods without ending up with a broken down ship and your crew getting wiped out over attacks or by just randomly exploring and harvesting goods from planets. Its not sustainable by any means. Ive tried being peaceful and hostile. Futile.', ""The game should hold your hand a lot more. Instead your given short summary of gameplay that didn't help at all. I got to the planet and I struggled with what to do once I made it to the planet. Way to many menus to navigate thru. The game should help you out by flashing what you can do when you get to a planet. Instead it's up to the player to figure out what to do in this game. This is on the first mission. If I have to look online to play your game your doing something wrong."", 'Boring just going on and on without real objective. Modified: thanks for replying, the game is cool and easy to maneuver just that it get boring at the long run so mayb in your next release, you could just put a storyline someone can work on so it wont just be traveling from one star to the other till you get tired of travelling and making money', ""I wanted to buy the full version, but after seeing the free game arbitrarily expire multiple quests I just picked up, before I even left the planet...I'm not gonna pay for that level of electronic insolence. edit: but i reinstalled it because it's still the best on the platform"", 'Classic star tràder game with no adds. Premium version is not required but highly recommended. More of a strategy game than a shooter but very addictive once you get into it.', ""Cool game to play but got zero graphics and if you don't buy upgrade your very limited to what you can get."", 'At first its not very clear as the world is as alien as LOTR but the battles are nice ,the fractions are confusing ,lucky they have auto gps like drive so u let them bring you to your quest .not meant for simple minded players,the options are plentyful in the free version . good work but the background markers are annoying the most', ""I rate this game 4 of 5 stars. It has been clearly developed over many hours into a smooth, carefully constructed work of art. The game's tutorial is short and to be honest, I uninstalled it the first time I played due to my perceived difficulty of learning the game. Returning some time after I have found that it is a captivating and open-concept space RPG. Lots of content locked behind Elite edition but still a fun game."", 'Nice idea but poor execution. Tried to play several times but just gave up due to too many bugs/design issues. Specific issues encountered: 1. Accessing cargo info gives encounter chance. Terrible design choice. 2. No planet names on map. 3. Search always finds contraband even if none was there. Many more. Really wanted to like it but ended up deleting after several tries.', ""So far I'm enjoying this game. The only thingd that are bugging me are after purchasing the elite version, I have to start the game then go to Google to start the elite version. Secondly, the messages that pop up during the game are way to quick to read. Other than that, great game so far!"", ""I generally dont play games on my phone. the marketplace is full of junk. Star traders is one of those few games that I install on every one of my phones. I dont know why, I'm pretty bad at it, but I always enjoy trying again to not die somehow. well done, it's got me coming back for years. and one of these times I'll survive long. haha."", ""One of the best turn based strategy games I've played on my phone. Had it one iPhone and now my android, although I do prefer the android version. Would play this game for hours, love Ritch backstory. The help page is an exhaustive resource for how to roleplay. There are so many great roles, although if I had to criticize one it would be the smuggler, since although the given definition of a smuggler does fit, it would be better if you could transport illegal products to a black market which are legal in other markets. Rather than the permit method that's in place. I do enjoy the build your own ship feature, always fun to create a custom ship. However I would have hoped the bug that lets you build it for practically free, was fixed by now. But still is a pretty cool feature. I hope you guys continue to add subtle updates or even start a remake or another similar game. Thanks for the fun gaming times!"", ""It's 1992 again! Good reminder how much fun those games were. Could use more of everything (ships, planets etc.) but really good blast from the past."", 'Very good , lots of micromanaging and tweaking . Can be played many different styles .', ""Fun, free space romp, haven't tried paid version, but it seems like it too would be even more fun"", ""I've been playing this game on and off for years now and still has a great replay value even then. I'll eventually be able to buy the Elite version, but for now this will do. Gotta admit though, the first time I've played this I couldn't understand a single lick of what I'm supposed to do."", 'Great game even with the rng and constantly raising difficulty conspiring to end me. Part 2 is awesome but i still play this on a junk phone whenever I have issues with my new one acting up', ""The game has a steep learning curve, but once you get over how things work it's ok. One can spend quite a bit of time playing with the different captains, finding out what works for you which can be fun . The lack of advertising is great and though I haven't bought the full game yet, I am tempted."", ""I've had a lot of fun with it. Simple, engaging, and no purchase needed to enjoy it. I eventually decided to buy because it's a lot of fun and its not expensive"", 'Great game, free version is exemplary of what free/premium balance should be . as for now its a tactical roleplay game , would love to see it getting some character storylines which could in turn make some long term impacts and add strategy level depth. only minus is theres no real objective except surviving which at some point becomes just too easy. Also would love to see pc platform game from you guys cause this is great work here', ""If you like games like Elite, this one's for you. No ads and 100% free with simply less content than in the premium version(which I'm going to buy now). Thank you Cory for this amazing game!"", 'Excellent game. Though there are several features that can only be unlocked by paying for it, the free part of it is great. The open endedness of it has me hooked and it runs great on my antiquated android.', 'Great game, have come to it multiple times over the years. You can play it at whatever pace you prefer and have a pretty good time. Harder difficulties are just that, so test each one out until you find the right challenge for you.', 'These guys have got to drop some coins on some decent character portraits, characters across all these games look like marchers in one of those fruitcake pride parades Gameplaywise, OK, but overextended.', 'I have always enjoyed playing simulation trading games like Patrician 3 and space themed games like Endless Sky. Graphics are very simple and the interface is pretty text heavy but it gives an old school RPG feel. Thanks to the folks who developed this game! Awesome work!', ""Just didn't grab me. I've played this type of game for years but this was too awkward, extremely unclear menus and monotonous."", ""A whole lot of fun. Feels basic, but entertaining enough to play around with different mechanics. It's a great game, regardless of whether you want to play for a few minutes or a few hours! I'm definitely curious about the more recent one!"", ""I'm still guessing on how, who, where, why and many other questions that haven't got the answer about the game's plot.

Other than that, I wish the tutorial section helped a bit more.

I'd recommend it to others who like this game style for sure."", 'used to love this game. more recent updates have made it less appealing to me. got a bit grind-ish for no good reason I can see.', 'Cant build a fleet.

Best Turn-Based Strategy Role Playing Game I've ever played."", 'Simple yet challenging, addicting to play, makes you sometimes lose track of time.', 'Just needs a slightly lower difficulty curve, for early game harvesting and exploration.

But execution is off. Campaign had a pretty interesting story but only one chapter making solo play impossible. Cards pools for each fraction had a lot of depth and strategy but between astronomically high pack costs, miniscule scrap and other in-game credit rewards and a randomized card selection process it makes it impossible for new players to progress in an organized way. l recommend everyone to try out the game though.

There's no other CCG with this level of open-ended depth. You can customize your hero (commander) and choose your deck size (up to 40 cards). You want speed? Fine, but you'll sacrifice health. Do you wanna tank? That's cool, but your playstyle will be slower. Each school (faction) has several ways to play unlike most CCGs. Why this game is not more popular is beyond me; especially since it's so much easier to get cards. The only thing I can think of why this hasn't caught on are the different names for standard concepts (ex. haste=mobility), as well as the deep deck building, may make it harder for CCG newbs. My only gripe is the deck builder in the app is really difficult to use.  If you have large fingers you'll screw up your deck constantly because just tapping the cards on the deck list removes them. I recommend downloading the game on Steam for making decks; it has a more intuitive interface. In conclusion though, great game! Seriously PLAY THIS instead of Hearthstone. It's much better... and you CONSISTENTLY get cards!"", ""This game is just absolutely awesome as the graphics are spectacular and lovely to look at.  It does an amazing job of catering for all ages with its many user-friendly and sensational game features.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone who has an affinity for card-based games.  The only real flaw in this epic game is the fact that we are not able to trade our cards with one another and if we could,  it would most certainly open up exciting avenues which would improve the quality of gameplay experience overall  .  Lastly, it is the type of game you just don't want to miss out on, so that's why I have awarded this game with 5 stars.  XD"", 'Avoid it!   Getting smashed by Pay-to-Win players is not fun.   This game constantly pits players with many heroic/rare cards against noobs. Either the devs are too unable to fix the matching logic (its been almost a YEAR!) or more likely, they do it deliberately to force you to spend money.  A very UN-enjoyable experience either way... its no fun to smash other players either.  Yes, well aware of ""exploration"" etc. but the problem is in the matching logic. Pitting a player that has ""explored"" for 100\'s of hours to outfit themselves with 2 heroic modules VS someone with nothing is just plain dumb.', 'gameplay is very fluid with nice graphics and an average storyline, would recommend this to my friends if not for the low amount of playerbase', 'Awesome game! Great .concept for a TCG. Being an MTG player myself I very very much so, enjoy this game! Thank you for this game!', 'Excellent TCG.

My main critique is not even against the game itself but rather against touch-controls. I played through most of the game but finally gave up due to frustration with the controls, soooo many times I died due to stuff like moving instead of drinking a hp pot. I do have big fingers though :) Another critique is that it can be a bit annoying trying to figure out where to get some of the materials for different quests, checked the wiki alot', ""I've been to Tendra.

Thank you so much!"", ""This game is the best game I've played on my phone, I have lately been really ticked off at f2p mobile game greed.

I'll leave a more detailed review after I beat the game."", ""One of the best building games I've played on a mobile device. The controls are great compared to similar games, and the story is pretty funny. The graphics, rewards, and writing are also better than most games. The only downside is on some of the quests you may forget what you were doing originally, and the conversation before hand may not be that helpful in remembering where you need to go."", ""This is the best and most memorable game on android I've ever played. Well worth the money. Great gameplay that is fun and challenging. Lots of crafting, looting, gearing up and things of that nature. Plus it has a Minecraft-like base building feature which adds tons of hours of gameplay. Story is perfect for a mobile. It's not too drawn out and deep, but has enough to it to be entertaining enough to drive you further in. Last but not least, it has a good sense of humor to the writing.""]"

• Technical improvements to support future releases
• Bug fixes and optimisations","[""I play the game sometimes on my phone which runs quite good, then when I run it on my tablet (4gb ram and 30+gb free storage android 8, realistically I doubt it will get android 9. Brand new only came out in 2019). It judders/laggy why can't you optimize it for tablets which are not as powerful as expensive phones. I don't want to strain my eyes looking at a small screen while playing games all the time."", ""A fun game, but I have a few problems. One is the Revenge attack option. When you get revenge on someone, they can attack you back. Thai goes on for forever, and it's no fun. Another is a glitch where you get a 100 percent raid, but lose credits for it and get 0 percent. I am not sure why this happens, but one clue may be the fact that I cannot review the attack. Also, the troops that target turrets shoot at everything in their way, and they die because of it."", 'I absolutely love this game, and am addicted. I actually use to be level 7 on my Kindle but then I lost my progress and then the game got discontinued on Amazon devices so I was out of luck, but now that I have it back I am already almost level 4 after two days! The only complaint I have is graphics. I also have a suggestion, if you use gems to speed up the training/building process, there should be an occasional malfunction or accident occur between your troops/soldiers.', ""I absolutely love this game. It is essentially a skinned version of clash of clans, but I thing it does a much better job as far as game play. Clash forces players to either save a ridiculous amount of resources or buy gems in order to upgrade buildings and units. Star wars does a better job of balancing this. The amounts aren't as high and seem much more attainable, but players can buy crystals if they prefer to upgrade things quickly. I play this game daily and enjoy every bit of it."", 'I have a suggestion for the game, a pretty small one to be honest. Instead of taking all of your soldiers after a battle, why not make a medbay or a repair garage and keep the soldiers and vehicles that survived like all the other games that have the same gameplay as this. In other words this is a very good game and I would suggest this to a handfull of friends, but that small ittle detail just gets me a little bit fustrated.', 'Every aspect of the game is fine besides for the amount of new and better content. There should be more of a variety of bases because when maxed out, it is just gold and gold. There should also be more troops to use. There should be special upgrades to armor and weapons to make troops better. Also, it would be cool to have a Mandalorian mercenary', ""The concept is amazing. But I am giving it 3 stars (for now) because it can use a LOT of improvements. 1. The most important one for me is that I am not able to connect with my friends and see anyone who plays it via facebook. I know a few friends who play this and they are on facebook. We tried to connect with facebook but we just cannot see each others accounts. I actually even know what the bug is. 2. I would love it if I got to play both sides. Because I just can't pick one. 3. It would be helpful if I could select a few walls and upgrade them together. 4. Sometimes the game just slows down."", ""Pay to Play: This game is basically unplayable past level 3 unless you are willing to drop serious cash into it, feels bad. You have to wait 24+ hours to upgrade buildings in some cases. Could be a fun game if the economy didn't try to bleed every penny from its users. With so many entertainment options available this game isn't worth your time or money."", 'I m having a blast im obsessed ill being playing this game for a long time. You can join friends and do squad battles or send troops to each other. You can play as rebels or the empire. Its a cool time killer when your not home or fun at home while watching tv. Its got a fun campaign also. Should give it a try its a good game star wars fans should play no matter what. Other people should give it a try. Graphics are cool gameplay is fun.', 'I love this game I been playing this for two years but thir is one con to it it takes so long to upgrade building but it all worth it at the end. And it reminds me about how you suppose to have sertant rank to get access to something anyway I want to this game all the support I can give. If your a developer of this game thank you for making this.', ""This game is incredible to play in terms of gameplay, although there is a couple downsides.. it's pretty difficult to edit your base considering the smallest buildings take up too much room aswell as everything else. (You'll know what I mean if you play it long enough) the second downside is the time limited attacks, most games like this of course are time limited when attacking other bases or single player campaign, but only get 1min 30sec to attack. Need to give more time for attacks."", ""1. Please add slots to save training queues, it's so annoying to fulfill spaceports after each battle. The idea of stored presets is so easy and obvious. 2. The same about base layouts. We need at least 3 presets to use during dayly activities. One for heroic defense, another for rival defenses. One more for wars. It's so obvious, again. - Minus 1 star for each point ;)"", 'Units are way to expensive. And buffers are extremely long. Game needs to be rebalanced. The game itself is buggy as hell. Not to mention every time I open threw game it takes forever to load and the lock out screen times out when I unlock it restarts the game. Complete garbage. Rushed through production. Rushed through release. Left alone with all its issues.', 'The only thing keeping my 5 star away from this game is how poorly optimized every screen transition is. Invariably, open your barracks? 10 second freeze before the training page. Use the arrows to scroll to your factory from the same screen? 10 second delay. Want to hit play and attack? Few seconds. Want to access your crates and unit samples? You guessed it. I spend more time transitioning between screens than I do training troops and attacking. Could be a great SW basebuilder otherwise. Rip', ""It's a good game but i think the time it takes to upgrade is a bit ridiculous. I get that you can spend Crystal's but they are very hard to get like you only get 20 or 30 a month just wish it was a bit faster but the battles and construction of the base and moving planets is Brill 8/10"", 'I really enjoy this game, although I find that it is slightly held back by what I consider to be a few balance issues. In my opinion, the time given for attacks is not long enough, especially becoming worse as you progress. Additionally, I believe some buildings begin to take too long to upgrade rather suddenly around base level 4 or 5. Other than this and more minor issues, this game is very fun and interesting to play.', 'I play this about a year ago and I put in 3-4 MONTHS of progress and I loved it. This is a fun game for what it is. But one day I loved on and an error happened and ALL of my progress was GONE have a year gone in one day. So I warn you 1 day all your stuff might be gone. I will give it another chance and see how it goes.', ""I've spent about $75 on this game. The defects just gets worse as you progress.... It's Star Wars, so it's gotta be fun! But the game loads slow and reloads everytime you leave to check your email or chat. And another thing that really really annoys me... I have in-game sounds and music on silent, but everytime the game reloads, the lightsaber sound goes off! I wish it was better, but there's just too many good games out there to continue playing and hoping that the programmers will fix it."", 'Strategy games has been a fav of mine but my oh my star wars tales it to a whole new level. Giving it my best strategy of the moment. More of the same. To infinite and beyond!!! I guess you could add an open space feature were you get to travel round the galaxy fighting on diff planets and also make the bad guys easier to kill, nothing bores a game more than having to try to kill bad guys for a long time. Cheerio.', 'The game is solid, but I have a few minor gripes. The troops tend to attack walls unnecessarily, there should be an option to play two separate builds light/dark side (admittedly, I\'m not done with the story, and the ""paid"" currency is VERY infrequent. I have no problem paying for a game I enjoy, but these issues make it hard to want to continue.', ""It was fun when I first started playing. However, as I progressed further, I noticed a few things that ruined continuous playability for me. First, building/ training times. It's ridiculous that I have to wait up to 24 hours for 1 barrack to complete an upgrade or a platoon of troopers to be battle ready. I considered using crystals to bypass the waiting time, but that option requires a lot of crystals. I spend most of my time waiting rather than playing."", ""Great game. Good story. The game never gets boring. When you loose a defense, unlike other similar games ( Boom Beach), you don't loose everything. Upgrades are streamlined and easy. I got easily addicted to this game"", 'The EP needed for quest play is ridiculously long high for elite crates. Rebels get weak troops and the Empire is way powerful. War matchs are lopsided to Empires favor matching 9 to 11 Prestige Empire against 2 to 4 Rebels Prestige. I have lvl 9 Rebel base been on great squads but always in the Empires advantage. I love the game and the play but started an Empire base due to the above. Glitches big problem no way to contact developers after lots of money on crystals just SOL', 'Unless you have hours each day to spend on this game don\'t waste your time. Good luck trying to get a foothold in anything. You\'ll be attacjed constantly and even when under a ""shield."" The only thing the developer says is that you should build up defenses and play more. Not worth the time. Seems like they are now just mining for your money to get further in the game. Very disappointed with how downhill this game has gone', ""I love this game so much been playing for years now, however the biggest gripe I have is Greedy Disney their are so busy trying to find ways to get as much money out of your pocket to play the game they over look how many times a day the game crashes So Sad. UPDATE : after leaving a poor review I've noticed I barely get attacked anymore when I log on it shows I'm being scouted, by whom? Then when I attack a base no matter the lvl I lose REALLY DISNEY ?? Wow beware ppl I'm getting an investigator"", ""I love this game. It's similar to clash of clans but it's also very different in gameplay and design . The bad thing is that some upgrades go up in cost way too fast but that's just me being picky. Other than that I would 10/10 recommend"", ""Purchased alot of crystals the in game currency and then all of a sudden my account diasapeared and they say it can't be recovered , and they are not willing to give me my crystals back as I accepted I have to start again , full on robbery and disgusting , support is like talking to a robot there are better games out there ."", ""I would personally recommend this game to teens and older people... It's quite easy to get resources without paying with gems or real money if your strategic with your forces in the Empire, something newbies & younger kids don't know about. Anyhow, You lost a star for using a flawed chat filter that censors non explicit words, minus another for losing my orginal data progress, and lost 2 stars due to the TX-225 on the Empire's side not crushing walls."", ""Things need to coast less. And to buy another drone. It shouldn't be 500. You can't save anything but credit and alloy. And when you try and save those things lol you can't because everything coast to much.

But if you would make those changes for us players and who don't have money to."", ""I like this game quite a bit, although I'm pretty bad at it (I'm not the best tactician out there,) more often than not I rely on sheer numbers alone to overwhelm my opponent, which usually ends up either working perfectly or being a complete waist of resources, despite that I can't deny that this is a very solid game with decent graphics and fun gameplay."", 'This Game has been an application since 2013 since this time it has undergone alot of updates and changes. The game is relatively based off of how much you play it and the more you play it the harder the competitors get. It is also pretty squad based which revolves around other competitors giving their resources and time for another squad member. Which kind of brings out the social aspect of it as well. It a time based stratgey game that relys on placement and it takes too much time to play.', ""Waiting too long for things to upgrade. When upgrading a couple things it took 5 days too upgrade. While waiting for this to happen I downloaded a couple other games and lost interest in this one. Anytime it takes an hour to upgrade something or longer. I end up closing it and playing another one in which doesn't take forever to upgrade a headquarters should not take an hour to do. This why I haven't logged on in a couple weeks. What is the point"", 'Very fun to play. Lots of options for strategy, and for and base and troop placement. Very balanced where new players are matched to similar players so that even after starting several years after the game has been out you can still be competitive.', ""Good for a few days, then I realised it's so repetitive: attack a base, defend a base, attack a base, blah-blah-blah.The actual gameplay needs much more variety. Also, there's insane waits for stuff to upgrade, a baffling squad system, and after all this time spent upgrading the HQ and factory I'm still stuck with the basic model of vehicles. There's no incentive for me to continue investing time in this game. Bye!"", 'Initially this game is a lot of fun, then the wait times to upgrade get ridiculous. You’ll have to wait at least 24 hours to upgrade one building, while getting attacked by players many levels above you so there is no hope for defense. It is obvious this is a cash cow for Disney since crystals are the only way to upgrade faster, otherwise you just let the games sit on a shelf for days on end for upgrades to occur. The more you attack, the stronger the base as you get match so there’s never any hope for getting anywhere fast.', 'Alright, been playing for awhile, and this game does deserve more then 5 stars. But i have some requests for the developer. 1st, for the base layout, could you do an update where we can have multiple layouts? As well as be able to copy your home base layout to the war base layout in an update please.', ""Lots of fun but... the text is so tiny on my phone. I'm installing on my tablet to see if it's easier to play. My phone has a 5.8 in screen so it's not small by any means but very hard to read this game on it."", ""Base building mobile games are a dime a dozen. This one is entirely average, but star wars themed. Loot boxes and events to unlock special things abound. Feels slow at level 6. Not sure how active the playerbase is as I've not been attacked. You can be either empire or rebels. Functionally identical although empire asthetic is obviously superior. Kind of slow to load and sluggish to open menus or production screens."", ""Game is good... Main problem, you save for Troops, build troops start a mission then once it starts the game crash's you lose all your troops including the money spent building and have to start again.. this happens all the time.,......... Sort it out!!"", ""Overall I love this Game, I've been looking for a star Wars game like this one and now it's here. I really do wish there was a clone wars Version where you got to side with either the sepritists or the Republic but I'll just have to hope that'll one day be a thing. Great game, good controls, love the designs of the units and turrents, and great music choices for both sides. Great game""]"

The main irritating bit I remember is if a mission you're retrying has dialogue, you have to run through it all, every retry. Minor annoyance, but easily fixed! Also, probably intentional, but things are somewhat randomized, so that you can play the same mission, in the same exact way, and have very different results!"", ""In fact, this game isn't playable at all or isn't free. Not enough resources to finish even the tutorial mission, without buying an upgrade pack. Need to move it to the paid games or give enough resources to make possible to play it without buying any upgrades, because its a cheating. Therefore giving just one star. The graphics and controls are good."", 'The game is fun, although the towers seem to attack a random target within range, because I had my tower at the end of the map and it didnt attack the monsters whom were destroying the ""light bulb"" yet it seemed to be attacking random targets. Why?', 'Best mobile game ever. Haxage you guys are amazing. The visuals are stunning - love the sound also - the gameplay is challenging but the reward is worth it, nothing is more fun than when my arsenal of weapons destroy all those aliens. A must play for every one. *****', 'Really good game,good graphics and soundtrack but i feel like it sort of raises its difficulty a bit too much at some points therefore making you buy the premium stuff buut it doesnt force you to do so, it just makes things a bit more difficult if your a f2p player.', ""This is one of the hardest tower defense games I've ever played. You'd need to spend money on the packs just to beat levels. They are super hard or difficult to beat. Unless you are willing to spend money on this game, don't get it."", 'The turret does NOT shoot the target that has traveled the farthest which EVERY tower defense should be. It makes zero sense that the turret randomly decides to shoot enemies in the middle of the pack.', ""WOW this game had so much potential. The art is charming, the dialogue is hilarious, and I had so much fun at first. But even in the second and third levels, they'll throw ridiculously impossible waves to defeat that are only weak to weapons in the purchase packs. There isn't a difficulty curve, there's a difficulty CLIFF. And I haven't been playing long enough to justify throwing money at it. I'd hate to think that the only reason I'm passing levels is because MONEY."", 'Excellent tower defence game, one of the best I ever played. Beautiful graphics, mezmerizing! Great gameplay, physics, mechanics, and smooth controls. Play at night in the dark for the best experience.', 'Most of the levels are next to, if not impossible to beat without buying several packs within the games, even the characters try to get you to spend money on this game.', ""I was able to brute force most of the levels people here are complaining were too difficult without paying (e.g. mission 12), but their point still stands that if you don't pay for better equipment/towers then the game will either be too difficult to be fun, or very grindy and trial-and-error based. I did enjoy all the levels that got difficulty right (read: were fair), though, and the graphics are wonderful."", 'What the heck? Starting from Monsters Ante Portas, the game already becomes very hard to beat. This game is pay-2-win with all those cool weapons (which may be very effective) are not available unless you buy the packs. Very disappointing. The coins that the aliens give should scale with how hard they are to defeat or what wave they are. Please balance the aliens and the weapons. Force shields are very hard even for max level energy weapons and the multiple-lasers-on-a-target debuff is stupid.', ""Great game very fun BUT (huge but), you can't buy upgrades without money. NONE of them. What a game killer."", ""This game is great. It is exactly what I wanted to install. To all the people giving this lower stars because it is to hard THATS THE POINT! If it's to challenging dont get stuck up cause you cant win. Thanks you HEXAGE for making yet another great game, and sorry I haven't posted a review on so long XD"", ""Amazing! I used to have this game back when I had a blackberry playbook and had to install this again. The gameplay is the same but we'll see what else is in store. I purchased the upgrade packs but I don't know if it's possible to restore hence the 4 stars."", ""This game is awesome. Yes you have to purchase the add-ons if you want those weapons, but you can beat this game without them, it's just significantly harder. The add-ons are worth the price for the hours of game play you'll get out of this game. I highly recommend this game if you enjoy a good, well thought out tower defense game with a great story."", 'Possibly best of a crowded genre. Getting to build the route is a game changer. Can buy all extra towers for a total of $8.', ""I except the challenge to pass level 3 and beat the game with out buying eny thang look up Hydra_Wafflez on YouTube then it should pop up Nova6_Clipzz I expect the challenge if this game is this hard then I'll beat it."", ""Frustrating. It's impossible to get pass by the Mission 4. No matter how I strategized, I always ended up loosing the mission. The great weapons that are perfect to use are those that are locked and needed to buy the pack-what-so-ever to have it unlock and to be abke to use it. I'm uninstalling this."", 'Okay tower defense with an unsatisfying gameplay. Tower inaccuracies are supposed to be part of the planning, but it just feels like poor implementation, in combination with the bad tower AI. Explanations and UI could be designed better. Enemy and tower explanation should be made more easily accessible.', 'This game is alot of fun and challenging. I like the module thing because you can alter enemies route its just give you a lot of strategy the beat the game', 'Tough game, definitely need strategy, almost need to spend a few bucks for better towers to win, the game is worth the 5 bucks or so, fun for free too though.', ""I played this game on my blackberry many years ago. I'm glad it's available on Android. It brought so many memories back. Yeah, you'll have to spend on packs, but there's no ads and it's worth it. They're fun packs."", 'Did not enjoy the game, I couldnt even pass level 2, the turrets are too inaccurate.', 'Absolute joke, The game looks good but it is near impossible once you get past the first few missions, the towers to near to no damage or are ineffective unless you spend real money on the better tower packs. The game is frustrating and unfair just to force you to buy the better towers. Sort your game out.', ""Amazing game, one of the best on the Play store. Graphics are flawless, gameplay is smooth, and I even found myself chuckling every now and then at a character's witty line which is a nice bonus. Many different ways to win, using various strategies, although after a while it becomes nearly impossible without buying the weapon packs (which are definitely worth the money) but still a great game nonetheless."", 'It gets pay to win after a while. the turrets are stupid when it comes to targeting. There should be a money generator or something. Please make one.', ""Nice idea, relaxing sound and graphics, but I don't relaxe so much because I can't beat mission 3. It's frustrating. It's thrice I downloaded the game in a year, last time I bought 2 packs and still cannot beat it, I'm uninstalling it and I'll only come back if I see a decent update that modify the situation. I'll keep an eye for updates because I really like the idea and the concept, but I can't play it, so, why waste my time?"", ""Great tower defense game. Decent variety of towers and great variety of enemies. The module system allows you to edit the map as you play for most levels for a neat new dynamic. There is one fatal flaw, however. The tower AI is absolute garbage. The player has no access to targeting options, yet the towers seemingly can't stick to one. This leads to an unfortunate reliance on RNG if you want to play conservatively."", 'I had the game on another device which i no longer have. I had paid to get all of the upgrade packs, when I used the same account on my new phone I didnt have any of my upgrades & lost all progress in the game (which isnt too bad because I like playin so much) so I have to start over and cant even use all the weapons and the money multiplier thing that i payed for 😡😠. So basically im screwed out of a little over $10. if i can find a way to fix this or get back my stuff or $ id give 5 🌟 4 sure', 'I bought this game on a nook device years ago for a single purchase and no premium upgrades. I would do that again. This free but not complete version is a slimy dogshit business model.', 'Its fun but balanced to favor capitalism. Becomes difficult to beat early on without upgrades', 'The first mission (not under control) is realy hard once you get to the 3 wave aleaat make it a little more easy and i dont like that you litterly have to buy almost every pack to finish the game i would give it 3/5 and pls make the waves easier please?', ""I just beat the first three levels without buying one pack. Yes the difficulty gets hard pretty quick, but so fsr its not been impossible. I had to redo level 3 ten times before I got the three stars, but its possible. Great game so far, and I'll update this review after I get through the next couple of levels."", ""This game is a tad too pay to win, but, I like replaying old stages and it's good, if you want more HEXAGE games, maybe play REDCON"", 'super nice concept of tower defense. i love the music, graphic, animations, and mechanics. the bad part its just there is no way other than paying with money to buy some towers that is needed to provide more help on levels. also the tutorial on how efficiency and score works is too small. but really its great td game.', ""I bought the packs to install the advance tech. materials or whatsoever and that 2yrs. ago from now. It's not really helpful when you reach the level where you have to beat the pink giant alien pig(I forgot the name lol).It's pretty useless when you set up some cannons for the fly aliens just to slow them down then it's no use for that giant one!so I got pissed up and uninstall the game. Problem solved!😎"", 'Love this game, always come back to it and have done for years. Just wish there was an endless mode where you get a blank / barebones map + 100 or so modules (+ 10 more after each boss) and see how long you can last.', 'Good tower defence, but a pay to win game. No other way to use advance towers other than using real money (impossible to beat the game without using them)', ""people criticize this game for being too hard. thats true, but thats where the challenge is. i assume the paid towers are actually not 'more powerful' than the basic ones, so i wont recommend this game to newer players. instead, this gives a good challenge for hardcore td players""]"

Especially if you have to spend hours grinding out levels."", 'The game play is simple and the mechanics are good but the monster generation through scanning get frustrating especially when you want to complete the quests. No story, simple retro graphics and extremely repetitive music which sometimes overlaps one song with another multiple times.

Monster Rancher), etc. All in all I enjoy playing it, just needs a little more variety and polish, can't wait to see what the devs have in store."", ""I really enjoy the game. Its a little different and doesn't require 100% of your attention.

I like the style of their games and the fact that you get what you pay for and not some trap like other games where it's anyone's guess on how far you can get with the initial price of the game. Good job you two, and I hope to see some new games from y'all in the future. To anyone else deffinetly buy them for the small price, that way you don't spend money on a game that makes you send more just to keep going! Thanks!!"", 'Nice tactical RPG, quite simpified compared to the likes of Baldurs Gate etc. but then again very in-depth compared to 99% of mobile games. Great story telling and the controls are just right for mobile devices. If you enjoy the more classic RPGs and want something to play while not having access to your PC this might be for you with tons of hours of gameplay and decent replayability. Enemy variety is a bit lacking but it does a good job of placing you in diverse combat scenarios.', ""Just a wonderful strategy RPG. I can always trust the Trese Brothers' work."", 'Great game. A true gem on the play store and worth every cent', ""So far so good. The levels are a bit long, but I'm enjoying the storyline. Also instead of making people buy the Paladin and the other special characters, why not let them be unlocked after finishing hard mode? It seems a little too greedy to make people pay for the game and then have to pay for the character classes. Would have given 5 stars otherwise."", 'Functional, straightforward tactics rpg. I enjoyed the classic themes and art. However, tactics and battles lack variety; battles are grindy and slow. Choke point, check. Debuffs, check. Chip, chip, chip away at the baddies. Mainly an exercise in concsientious team management. Few interesting options for team development; maybe IAP characters are more versatile, but base characters have a pretty inflexible role to play. Most people probably have better ways to spend their time.', ""Went back to this recently after trying frontiers.. not bad & definitely not lazy on storyline etc. I've made it to Red Hill assault but seems like every combat ya gotta buff/debuff to the max. Man, that got old fast \U0001f92d Please address enemy ability to 'point blank' attack with missile weapons (or at least allow my own idiot to respond in kind) it's a slog enough as it is without weird little inconsistencies like that. Make the sequel have a bit more non-linear yadda & sidequests. Merry thingmas!"", ""I can't really recommend this game. Perhaps it's because I've played more recent Trese Bros games and this one doesn't compare favourably. Ultimately that's testament to how much their games continue to improve. For an RPG the early stages are just too slow and grindy. You have to fight the same enemy again and again, using the same limited tactics. The loot and level ups give minor upgrades, so it just feels like there's nothing to look forward to. I recommend Trese's sci-fi games over this."", ""I think there's 2 choices with phone games. Free with ads and cash grabs or, like this, small upfront cost and that's it. It's a quality game with so much depth I can't recommend enough. Great developer who responds quickly too which is a bonus"", 'Love it! Many characters to pick from I am not sure which one I want in a group', 'Another wonderful mobile game from the Trese Brothers. One of the best on the market in its genre.', 'Enjoyable so far good price for the game but disappointed at the price of the extra characters', 'could do with more classes and such, but its a good turn based rpg.', 'Good game, interface is not optimal, but great, story-driven game with challenging fights', 'What I have played of it so far is good. I have not been disappointed yet with a game by the Trese Brothers.', ""It's a fun game with a solid story line and graphics. No exaggerated anime characters or silly voice acting. The games the Trese brothers make aren't like most mobile games, and each one is better than the last. I believ this is one of their older ones, and I'm really looking forward to a possible sequel."", ""I've played this game 3 times so far. change up the characters and it's a different experience each time. play only nightmare. strategy, hp and sp a must. Don't re-stat till level 18. Wish there was a similar game but old west setting."", 'Same thing as with STF. HOS no longer works on my device after the latest update. Good thing I held off of buying TBF. As im sure that will get updated too and eventually would stop supporting my device. Sad day for me. Great developers, great game, outdated device.', ""I love turn based strategy games like this. It reminds me of the old Sega Genesis shining Force days. One complaint I do have is that even with display set at maximum resolution the font is difficult to read. I am a visually impaired person so although I don't need gigantic font a little bit larger would be appreciated."", ""Limited and uninspired skills makes gameplay repetitive. The numerous random cut-scenes places your characters haphazardly and can result in tallied deaths; creating negative experiences because you no longer control your characters. Writing and storyline is okay, not bad but exactly good. There's a bunch of IAPs for things like additional classes, crafting, respecs, etc. It's not bad for an indie game I guess, but unlike some that rival games from more established companies, this is a very indie quality offering."", ""I'm a big fans of trese brothers game such as star trader series, but this one is on my bottom list. The battles are really repetitive. After a few hours its getting boring for me. Even the lore and story are not really that good if you compare it to star trader. I want to give it 1 stars but since Cory made another good game, ill just leave it at 3 stars here."", 'Almost as if you guys sold your souls The 4 Dark Ones just to make this venture happen; It\'s difficult to put down, the action is satisfying as Hell, the Cleric is a tank when used correctly, I mean this is what an RPG on mobile is supposed to feel like! No generic pixel graphics, memes just to force humor/narration, or any ""Idle"" mechanics that we see too much of.', ""Awesome game. The dev's are truly dedicated to making a quality product."", 'I love and hate this game. I love the turn based strategy games like this and keep playing it. On the other hand, this game is also the reason I have broken several phones from frustrating attempts to do something in game.', 'What the hell! I can\'t even open this thing. Every time it says ""unfortunately heroes of steel has stop"". What is this, i bought this thing and i can\'t even play it.', ""Hands down the most well-written RPG I've ever seen on android."", 'Great game worth the money. I really wish they would make a second one or they would make more characters to play with. I would buy more characters to play through it', 'Fantastic game in a small package. Epic story and worldbuilding, intuitive fighting mechanics, smart pathfinding, and varied character development paths. Artwork is quirky but ultimately charming. Highly recommended.', 'a couple things could be better more traps but not stacked for 4 traps in a row. if your out of range move forward to do the action. i think heros should be able to pass through one another.', 'A great turn based RPG. Simple to play, but with good depth. In addition, the story is interesting and motivates you to save your team.', ""Fun and classic RPG. Love the style and we'll done controls that work great for mobil. It's great that's it's not a giant download as well!"", 'The game overall is fun. I recently purchased the Rogue to try it out and it was unlocked Phone was acting up so i deleted game and reinstall and the rogue character is unable to be used. And can you guys please help check it out? I am not sure who to contact', 'This looks like a pc game ported to phone. The various text on menus and selectors is so tiny i can\'t read it on a 5"" screen. Not worth trying to play, instant regret.', 'Solid game. It actually feels better as a touch interface than on PC!', 'An amazing RPG, flat out, regardless of platform.', 'what I enjoy in an old fashion slash bang bang game. Enjoyable and nerve wracking. No. ads', 'Always a great from these guys.', 'I like the game a lot. Definitely worth the buy. will there be more character classes added?', 'Epic old school RPG!', 'Bit repetitive.. knew that coming in. . Fun overall. Play it']"

New prestige level for items! 
Prestige Scribe & Maps, twice the difficulty
Bug fixes","[""The game has pluses and minuses: I can praise it for being somewhat original, and for having an amazing artstyle, which I think fits the game very well, and, of course, for being a pretty fun game, if you're into grinding of course... The worst thing About this game is the grind to get enough materials to get a level up to make equipment for heroes who get more materials. One other HUGE minus, is that the appearance of heroes doesn't change based on equipment. Also, the enemies are repeditive."", ""The game is great and the new mechanics are quite an improvement, but there are two big flaws that need to be addressed: 1) If you put an item on your shelf to sell and then put it back to your inventory, most times the game won't register you took it back unless you put another item on the shelf. Once you close the app the item will be sold even though it shouldn't have. 2) The Epic Bosses Cragus and Galam are not affected by a Mage's Silence attack, meaning they cannot be debuffed in vanilla"", ""I had a lot of fun starting out, but quickly got challenging to the point where it wasn't fun. I think that it would be nice if the more you did an action, the faster the time would be. For example, if you killed 1,000 Tuvale Treants, the hunting time for the Treants would decrease by 50 percent permenantly."", 'Amazing game for those who like the genre, but it still has a lot of space for improvements. There should be an way of reducing the time it takes to complete quests, some kind of mechanic perhaps? That would be cool. Also, allowing the player to do quests with more than one character at the same time would be a nice improvement. Multitasking is such a huge aspect of the game, not allowing the player to do quests with multiple characters simultaneously feels counterintuitive, dont you guys think?', ""First things first, the art style is top notch. Now the game itself is a rinse and repeat of the same enemies but slightly altered in the next area. I thought the customization of armor and weapon would actually show on the hero but instead it's just bland generic picture. There are no ads unless you wish to get extra gold which is a HUGE plus, but sadly I can't bring myself to continue playing with mission payouts being 2-3 items each time. I'm not going to waste my time stockpiling items."", 'Very deep game with great progress line. You slowly level up your heroes, while collecting ,aterials to build equipment and level up your crafters. The weekly bosses add a feeling of rarity, but without the feeling of missing something. The only real downeide is that you have to send your heroes one each quest/start building equipment. A button to say ""repeat this quest 100 times or until you die""/""build this item 20 times or until storage is full/not enough resources"" would make this perfect!', ""I LOVE this game it's perfect, everything I love about fantasy games; mainly the fun crafting! Update: I haven't run into any problems with this game, it's a fun challenge do download this! Tip: When crafting check recipes (left side) for what you can't make yet and try to get the item. Also, you can go back to lower level areas and farm items to craft items to make gold."", ""Absolutely amazing game that had me addicted for a very long time. My only problem and the reason I gave this game 4 stars is that there's no save system or any way to restart the game. If the devs fixed this I would definitely give this 5 stars."", 'The game itself is a pretty good time killer. Great content, sometimes challenging. I just wish the equipment of the character would show on the actual picture of the character, would be a cool feature. But all in all I rate 5 stars!', ""Absolutely a five star game, so well crafted and put together with very simple concepts in mind. It provides a suitable challenge yet doesn't require grinding. I highly recommend the expansions as they open up a whole new level to the game (not essential but definitely fun). No ridiculous number of stats that do different things, just plain defence and attack (and magic equivalents) and accuracy is all there is at the core of it. Clearly a lot of thought an passion went into this brilliant game."", ""The game's good, I found crafting progress a tad too slow but otherwise it's okay. What really made me drop two stars was, however, how grindy this game is - mainly the rare materials. I've been farming materials for a single sword for the past two days, and am only at 8/15. At this point, the game's not really fun anymore."", ""Its awesome but the special monster appearances and their drops are very rare so it would be nearly impossible to get a certain item that has the venom's fang(all I'm saying is to make it so monsters like venom and etc appear for frequently and drop their item like the venom's fang more)"", ""A well devised example of the genre. Crafting formulas gain in complexity with the levels, demanding a clever management of your heroes and inventory. The rewards for tough tout craft items are monetarily exponential, translating to growth of you capacities, giving you plenty of incentive to go that extra mile. The combat, while automated, does require thought and tuning when you go after rare beasts and bosses. For the routine stuff, it's quick and simple, and the delay for completion is brief."", ""Absolutely phenomenal!! Probably the most well made game ive had the pleasure of playing on my phone. If i could give 6 stars i would! My reasons why; - Ad's are SO WELL DONE! Not a single, annoying ad at all! I could play this game and see zero ads if i wanted! But i choose to, and get ingame currency and help support the devs! - Fantastic gameplay! Super fun, engaging and well balanced. Not up to endgame stuff, but man its already super cool! - Fun graphics! I really like the simple style!"", ""It's well put together and admirable for it's size and scope, but there just isn't quite enough there. Without animations of any sort, aside from the main hub, the game struggles with emersion."", 'THIS GAME IS ACTUALLY THE BEST!!! I really, truely, think this is the exact game ive been looking for that keeps me absolutely engaged and doesnt have excrutiatingly long waiting periods but just long enough so that you can play the game constantly. I love this game and have been hooked since getting it.', 'great game, awsome time waster it would be cooler though if the characters appearance changed based on what armor sets they were wearing including weapon and clothing changes depending on whats equipped otherwise this game us great, money gain can be a bit challenging too but over all its awsome, id love to see that armor change though, great game', ""The game itself is very fun but the lack of storage slots really makes things a grind and I got bored before I really would have. Maybe you can make separate storage slots for mats/items or something to balance? I played a lot for a couple weeks but I'm so sick of grinding out thousands of gold to hold one more thing when each tier is adding 10-12 new things I need to be able to hold. I give up as I just don't have time to grind as a 30y/o adult."", ""This game could be popular in just 1 month in websites if this is an 3rd person rpg game y'know... I like everything. Everything the creator,i mean he/she put in the game is very detailed.... I would love to be coup and make a game with this creator 😅😂"", 'I have been playing this game for a year maybe more and I love getting legendary items from crafting and getting tons of money. Graphics fit the game style and it is overall a great game. One suggestion would be the ability to not sort your inventory and be able to manually do it.', 'This game in my opinion it is interesting because you cannot buy any extra money/coins/points/credits or any other support so that makes you think about you money management which will gone very fast specially if you have many Heroes. My favorite part of this game is that waiting part specially when you send out a group of very strong Heroes to fights with some Epic Boss and few minutes late you finding out that they are been defeded by the Boss and you start thinking how. NICE JOB GUYS.', 'I have a lot of fun with this program. You can grind each character to level them ... just start at the beginning and battle each step up a lot of times. This will build your character(s) and equip them. Then do it with each character.', 'Love it. The only problem is that the white text is thick and over saturated on my device. I have a ZTE Visible. Please look into this. Thank you!', 'It is a great game albeit slow, you do not partake in the action, instead you take the role of a shopkeeper selling the goods your hired mercenaries fetch for you, crafting equipment and either selling or equipping your mercenaries for higher leveled monsters.', 'Very fun, but the base game is WAY too short. I beat it in less than a day, between classes. Please add more worlds and new items.', 'I love this game the wait times are never over 30 minutes no ads and its a game i can play while im doing something else and i can drop it at anytime i love seeing my business grow i do wish that if my hero dies during a quest it just ends though', ""I'm playing on pixel 2. the three virtual android buttons remain onscreen during gameplay. in all other apps those buttons fade after a second. with those onscreen, i'm unable to press the in-game buttons, resulting in me exiting the game constantly. it's unplayable lol. it's kind of a joke."", ""I have an issue with a purchase I had for an extra hero slot. if I could get it fixed I'd raise the rating, but other wise it's pretty fun."", ""Quite fun with relaxing music. Time just disappears while battling, crafting, and increasing my shoppe's wealth...then spending it all in seconds on more battling, crafting, and merchantry!"", 'Very good game overall, but the timers for high level quests and crafting are excessive. I would gladly change my rating to five stars if that became more reasonable', 'Fun game. A lot is barred off unless you buy the ""expansion"" though. That upset me a bit but i enjoyed the game.', 'This is very fun game and I pull it put whenever I get the chance, really hoping the next game will expand on this game and make it better.', ""Nothing is more annoying when you press the button to go forward or back on page and it doesn't respond.. so you gotta sit there and repress it till you find the spot"", 'Great game. Optimized for low resource usage and scratches that RPG itch. Free for most, but reasonably priced extra content.', 'Fun. Idle. Rewarding. Can spend money, but definately do not need to. Ads can give you boosts, totally optional.', ""Though the genre might not appeal to all, it's a great off-line game and no purchase (or ad watch) is required to enjoy it."", 'This game is absolutely fantastic! I love every minute of ganme time and this is one of the only games of its type. Cant wait for the next chapter to this amazing world', 'Clusters of potential. Not always intuitive like how to set up the 5 skill turns. But its a cool game especially for offline. space merchants cooler a related game. And, i am Looking forward to this games sequal.', 'Very fun if you like this type of game. They have Cloud saves and the PC version links to your account on your phone which is a nice feature.', 'I only hope that eventually there will be some option to show the fights, maybe simple animations.

So first I want to start with visuals, this is my biggist problem as I know wha these developers are capable of. This is not that good to look at, the charater models are well not that good and I hink they could be better and we are paying for bad graphics.

Not for kids."", ""I've been playing this game for nearly seven years, and that alone speaks to how addictive it is. I've met some of my closest friends through Graal.

It's a dope ass game but my only problem with the game for real are the hotboxes and movement. Players are easily hit by npcs attacks and you can't really fight unless you're legit facing left/right fighting them.

But other than that best game that ive played that reminds me of zelda"", 'Its OK. when i used it on a mobile device it was fine, but when i used it on a computor the entire game color was switeched! it was mostly blue, with the colors reversed!

A great adventure game.', ""I only placed 4 stars because it still needs developing, bugs are still there and a number of quests still not complete, and it'll take some time. I love the pixel design, it satisfies my minimalistic side. Don't even get me started on customizing your own character with uploads. I like how you aren't required to purchase with real money, because all you need for gralats is a gh and a mount (2p preferably) and a stack of bombs, easy. I wish I could say more, but my 500 words are up. BEST MMORPG!"", 'To be honest, this game is getting boring not like the old graal.

I like how this one is skill based so there aren't people who can 1 shot others. This can put newbies at a disadvantage, but once you get basic skills you can fend off a little bit. Some pros tend to be rude to noobs but I just ignore them. There's also lots of customization so you can look the way you want. Definetly a 5 star."", 'This game was great it was my childhood. then i did all the mainquest, now the game is just a laggy and pointless grindfest. the community isnt the best but still there are soo many words that slip under the filter', 'Most of the time when i try chatting in this game it doesnt show what i said its been happening for a while and you still havent fixed the problem i would love for this problem to be resolved in some way', 'I love the game, spent cash on things i thought were worth to me but i do have a problem of areas and attacking, like as an expert on games and testing them, id like to point out how difficult it really is to attack mons, and since im not use to area names etc, u should try its here markers for maps or a search or list if we dont know where an area is, and if we cant enter an area, put instructions how like a quest of sort, it would improve the game much more, tho already adore the adorable game', ""I recommend nobody play this ... You can do one minor thing and the children who rule the game ban you up to a week. Not very entertaining and too many overly offended people. Don't play it you'll just get agitated and bored with it the second you play."", 'This game is fun and good enough, but sometimes it crashes immediately upon opening, repeatedly. Honestly really annoying.', 'Pretty nice game, there is a bug however. The HUD is disappearing for me? Is this happening with anyone else?', ""This game is pretty fun! Though there are some very perverted people on here, so I recommend you dont answer them. Some people are really rude on here, but there are some really cool people too! It's starting to get boring though. But overall it's an ok game :))) Edit: I quit this game! I stopped playing after the 4 years I played. :) It was a good run guys! I hope the ones who play to the end of this game's life, get an actual life hehehe (jk im joking)"", ""Ok, there are some bugs and one of this worm that looks like a glitch and yet why? Just fix, it's better if you just update the whole game. Yet this app is totally broken."", 'Its an amazing game.

I dont understand very good what the game wants you to do :/', 'My hangout experience could be better if I could actually use chat.

It is very possible to do well without ever spending money. Grinding isn't that tedious because rewards are usually pretty sizeable and the devs are definitely very generous with gifts and events.

Bottom line.. unless you're willing to spend hundreds every month, don't bother with this garbage heap."", 'I had an issue with 2 purchases. The game froze on me right after making both purchases.

Old school with 5 star characters only and no 6 star for raids would make it fun again.', ""Really enjoy playing this game.Glitches happen now & then,usually get fixed even if not immediatley.At the moment i am trying to get my old account back,i've had this problem before usually after i've changed the device i'm using.I just need to get all my facts together to prove it is my account & scopely will help me out.I don't like the fact that i don't have much money to spend on in game purchases,but i do spend if it's worth it & i need it.Hope this review has been helpful."", ""not sure why but i have logged in 5 days in a row and upgraded my town hall?(main building), it is going to take 55 hours! which in itself gets a 1 star, but EVERY single day i log back in, i have to REDO the upgrade, it will not save my progress, left the game running for 20 minutes and logged out, and STILL won't upgrade my building! uninstalling!"", 'Had this game over 2 years and everytime i spend 250 coins for s class or premier recruits i get some 4 star piece of sh**!! F*** this whole entire game! Not even any more story mode missions to beat and not enough good characters being put out for the users. Ive spent over 2000 coins and have nothing to show. Creators should be ashamed!!!!! Do not waste your time. OnLy way you can get decent characters is if you pay the stupid $ 30 A MONTH! AND STILL NO GUARANTEES. DO NOT DOWNLOAD!', 'I personally like it but there is one thing that really angers me your only able to make 2 material farms until you get your town hall to level 5 and if you click on the material farm it forces you to make it into a scavenger camp it says your can convert it back but at that point your stuck with 2 material farms and the game wont allow you to make more despite how much more land you can get which is not very functional, this to put it frankly pisses me off. It would be 4 stars otherwise.', ""**Game has been broken for me and many others, not even letting people past the title screen loading bar. Support just gave a vauge we are aware of the issue. It's been 3 weeks. 1 star until i can play again** It's about the same as every other mobile territory game, but its fun with TWD characters."", ""It's a great game with a ton of characters and events. However their offer prices are insane. Thankfully you can make progress without even paying but it's going to be a long road towards making a decent team. I'm one of those people who made it tho, so I speak from personal experience."", ""The game is nothing like the ad. In the ad the game is a rpg where you can make choices to survive the apocalypse. But the game is really a 2d battle against the zombies that has levels. This is the most disappointing game I've download so far."", 'Absolutly MUST PAY to win so you can dominate others players , Its useless. I go to raid but all players i took a fight for me is go beyond of my team reputation was on 2000k, but my opponent is go beyond more over it. And the i try find another ones and it always same. And then theres goes the arena and the event. For what if you make some event but to enter it you must PAY TO PLAY EVENT MISSION. MAKE SOME CHANCE BEFORE ALL YOUR PLAYER IS LEAVE. NO PLAYER NO INCOME. THINK FOWARD', ""Terrible progress retention. My phone recently crapped out on me and I had to reinstall the game on a new device. Although the game connected to my Google Play account, support claims they are unable to recover my account without a purchase receipt or direct link to facebook. No other game I had to transfer was like this. This is a piss poor design or maybe a way to punish those who don't spend money or allow them to generate data revenue from Facebook."", 'Still unable to download an update, unable to help my faction during falcon faction thing.

I wish odds and probability were real as they mentioned.', 'I absolutely love this game, this game is perfect for walking dead fans all over the world, but if there is one thing I would add is being able to create your very own character, you customising the character and their trait.

Now I understand they need money and they deserve to get paid I would pay by the month like I do for wow or other games. However it just fells like they are always grabing your wallet.

But the huge downside for me is the download of the game. Thie size of the download from the AppStore is something like ~ 71 MB. No problem. After starting the game it says it needs to download another ~ 1170 MB. Sure, go for it. But that second download will take hours if not days. I (re) downloaded the game yesterday. My WiFi was and is perfectly fine and I was not running any other apps on my tablet during the download. The game download gets stuck at around 10%. Every restart of the game nets me another ~3% of the download bar. so after 30-something restarts the download is finally finished. Took me hours to get to here. I start the game, want to spend some energy on World Boss - Game crashes. Restart and try again, same thing. So today I tried World Boss again, game keeps crashing! Okay, time to redownload the game.. AGAIN! And guess what, the download gets stuck AGAIN. Honestly, the game is fun. It really is. But this downloading fiasco is the worst I have ever witnessed.', 'It is a very nice and very addictive game on the downside however, if you do get a high lvl and acquire desirable summons hackers seem to be attracted. If you get hacked no real support to recover your account unless you keep track of money you spent on it ( if you did) my account got hacked 2 times should have learned my lesson after the first one', ""Good graphics, fun gameplay, clean and simple UI, no obtuse or confusing character progression/upgrade systems and many different units to play...If you can get them. Which leads to this games major problem: The 'Gacha' (the chance to obtain stronger, rarer characters or equipment) is truly awful, scam level in fact and among the worst of all gachas in that regard. Add onto this the constant pop-ups aggressively pushing absurdly over-priced packages and I can't in good conscience recommend this."", ""I really do love this game. Sometimes I find myself getting wayyy to sucked in and have to force myself away from the grind. I do have one wish tho. Another element type for Monsters. A green Earth type would be nice. We have Water, Fire, Wind, Light and Dark. You could even make it brown! There's so much potential with a new element type. New mons, new bosses, who knows...maybe even new runes. Please take this into consideration 🙏"", ""I've been playing daily since 2014, I had only 1 year pause from the game so that's still a lot of time active in the game. Despise me summoning so many light and dark scrolls in all this year's, I still didn't get any L&D Nat 5 however my husband that used to play, for a very long time, way less than me, he has one for over an year now. I play for so many years and I have 0 and I see people with 1 year old account having 2 or 3 Nat 5 L&D. Gj c2u, very nice of you."", ""Ever since the latest update, the app crashes whenever i do scenario and cairos dungeon.. arena is fine and everything else.. I'm using my hive account and i wasn't notified about any maintenances or what.. please send support. -sincerely, a summoner war veteran returnee Edit: i play in asia server and my account was created a month before the update and it was fine not until the update. BIG EDIT: I've found a solution for this problem. Simply delete 5 of your friends and go in a quiet channel."", 'Very very free-to-play friendly. One of, if not the best turn based mobile RPGs on the market. Very well established, tons of content to explore. There is always something to do. People who spend might get an upper hand in the Competitive Scene, but it is still possible to be strong and thrive without spending a single penny. Well crafted and the devs are very in with the community on a consistent basis.', 'Been playing for yrs, i love the game but things could be better, like having another tower for the people thats been playing for years so we can update our stats. Game takes up so much room on my phone. The games addicted. But i spend money and love the game. Wish we would get more things for free more often.', 'In my opinion,since we all have different thoughts,its a great game! Lots of characters to choose from,unique designs for each character,and great battle mechanics. For whoever is reading this,the game is easier if you can understand each monster you have and how their attacks have different effects. Synergy is key!', ""Excellent game once you get used to it. Don't, please don't, for the love of all thats good, don't compare yourself when starting this game to the players who have been playing for years. Competitive free to play, IF and only IF you are playing consistently. Don't expect free to play to be competitive if you only play 5-10 min a day. Awesome game otherwise. Been playing little over a month and highly recommended this game. Just keep your charge cable on standby..."", 'I love the game and been playing it since I was 7 and I am13 now but it been rlly hard for me to get good scrolls and better monster for my self. The only way to get good scrolls is if u buy them with money and as a teen like me and i dont have money like that to be buying 100 dollar bundles. So i feel like they should add more quest to get better scrolls and ruins. And keep adding events and updates. This is a very good game and I enjoy the grind but i just cant get good scrolls.', ""This game is truly incredible. There are so many things to do, you can play for hours on end. The auto battle feature make it perfect for when you're semi involved in a project of one kind or another. You can quite literally grow stronger, level up, and farm with a couple taps of the screen. On the other hand, there's a ton of engaging and challenging content for when you can give it your full attention. The fully customizable monster based gameplay allows for thousands of different strategies!"", 'This Game is so good. It will teach how to grind to do better to best and it will also teach how to be patient all the times and be responsible, in such a way on how you will spend energy and mana stone. Its not just a game their is deeper on it. Dont just stick on what you have grind more to be better at the game just like in life grind and grind until you succeed. More events to come. Thank you', 'This game has its ups and downs. The PVE based content in the game is very easy to clear once you invest time into it. Competitive is the endgame for players, and has 3 forms. Arena is ai based pvp, its broken for a long time now, everyone basically runs the same defence. Guild content is balanced, boring, but the rewards are great. RTA is real time pvp. This is THE endgame, since its the only true competitive mode. The rewards are mostly cosmetics though. As for Summoning rates... they suck', 'Great overall theres plenty of content. Suited for any type of gamer you are. Also can easily rank up in the game over time legit . No need to buy /play to win to still be competitive. 5*Community(worldwide) thats eager to help new players. Highly recommend you to start downloading! Very strat and stat orientated and can be quite the intellectuals game. Happy summoning', ""Good game. But im leaving 2 star review. The developers have left out auto farming when every other game offers it now. They don't care about your quality of life, and want you glued to their game 24/7. Moving on to calibria where there is an auto farm feature. Value my time com2us or i won't value your game."", 'I became unhealthily addicted to it, I enjoyed last fun moment today and now I declare quitting the game, I wanted transmorifigation but RTA is too tough and takes too long, also 6* monsters is hard to the point of making me lose focus of my old job, (that old job one of co workers introduce me to this game), please make it less addictive. Now I quit, I hope this is a lesson for everyone.', 'I do like this game and I want to give it more stars, but in the world arena (good will battle) I will accept an invitation for a battle and then it will say Error you will be brought to the tittle screen and then it makes me reload the whole game. I am quite annoyed and frustrated by this, so that is why it gets 3 stars for me.', ""Playing this game since beta and I've watched monster and rune drops go to an all time low it's very repetitive to get either a decent monster or runes for them...if they put a repeat button in for dungeons it wouldbe worth grinding but every single time having yo hit the button again makes for a long dragged out process that has a good possibility of not even getting anything of worth."", 'My favourite phone game. I love the variety of monsters and working out what teams work, often 3* are worth training up, not just super rare 5*s, and most 4* monsters are worth keeping. This game is pretty light on the power used to run it, updates regularly and love it enough to play on two devices. However, it keeps crashing on my tablet - which is a Huawei MediaPad T5.', 'Og player here This is the most time consuming game i ever see even if some parts can go in auto. The rune upgrading system is designed for make you upset. Not free to play at all. Highly depends rng whats make you do insane in the long run. And here i am playing this shity ass game for 4 yearhs now but why? Someone just end ny suffering at this point. Pls dont play this :(', ""Great game. You can really play however you want, but of course there's one way that let's you progress faster. People need to stop complaining about droprates because plenty of very good monsters are free, farmable, and really help you in every area of the game. Edit: contacted com2us. Crashing has been fixed. The new transmogs are nice, but please make the event end at some point so it's actually special to have them. Some monsters recieve lower stats upon awakening. Please fix this."", 'Hello com2us in need of help here. The game have a problem with me after 15 days of playing. The scenario and cairos won\'t open for me. It force closes and wastes my energy. I have already deleted the app but it\'s just the same, forces itself. A message flashes itself, it says something about a ""debugger attached"".', 'I love this game but the new update with the world arena rune is sooo dumb its just a wast money any time i want to fight my friends. For example: I would get a new rune i would like to put on my monster, so i did then time to go and fight my friends it is not on the monster and i have to put it on again and have to remove the rune i had on before with money and it is very very Annoying!!!!!! And a wast of my gems', 'Summoning sucks. I went threw over 30 mystical schrolls and a legendary schroll and only got 2 4* monsters. Wouldnt be such a bad thing except the mystical schrolls keep giving me 3* monsters that ive already summoned over and over again. I would say that maybe im unlucky but ive reset my account numourous times to find out if this was the norm and turns out it is. Overall i think this game is all about making money and they want u to spend that money in order to gain 4* or 5* monsters', ""Latest update to the old arena wrecked it. Now if some troll wants to lose on purpose 20 times my history is full of successful defences that I can't fight back and earn glory point. My arena rank is then too high for me to fight and beat anyone so my only option is to pick a few players to fight and lose making them have the same problem. This game keeps sliding down hill. Also I will not be getting the sequel to this game unless everything from this one transfers. Events still are broken too"", ""The game is a scam. Played for 5 year's to get to lvl 50 and get my first nat 5 star. Really don't recommend this game unless you have thousands of dollars to spend for nothing. Come2us is a greedy com that only care how much money they can get with the least amount of effort. Hope you give it 1star review cause that's what it's worth."", 'Everytime i click something a pop up shows up. All the new content and monsters that have been added are purely for meta cash and time wasters. for instance they installed a component to craft runes, the component drops in the same location the item it crafts into drops. on top of that you get one reward for 8 energy and 90 max energy. they added a lot of new content but you spend so much time grinding runes you have no energy for said content. which is a shame, game could have be fun.', ""Used to love game 5 stars only because people need to know if your not going to spend hundreds and thousands of $$$$ don't even download. They may have made it easyer to get scrolls witch I s what u use to obtain units they'd rates are so so low don't even want to no the light dark rates it's 50$ for 1 scrolls and u only have a 1_16 chance for a 4or 5* unit. I love the game have played 1 account since 2013 and have summoned 6 Nat 5s the rest are fusion. And only have like 450/1200 units"", ""It has been an amazing game so far have had lots of fun playing it. I have ran into a problem with the game it will open normally and do it's loading stuff and when it gets to where it says ready to start I press the screen and the game closes itself."", 'Hello com2us. I aappreciate your efforts for better arena experience but I have a problem in my runes. The problem is when I changed and fixed my runes in my monster storage it went through but when I entered world arena it did not change or update at all. Please check it com2us and I love your game.', ""Great game been playing for years. Always new things to do, and feels great to play even if you don't spend much time playing. Events are fun and plentiful. Would recommend and have to my friends. If you play make sure you invite friends in game rather than just tell them like I did.😃"", ""Getting boring. It's a really really good addictive game you won't regret playing for sure and I've actually spent money on it. But i haven't had a nat 5 in about 6 months now. I just want some new monsters to play with. I've started to look for a new game to play because im getting bored :("", ""Lovely graphics and visuals, and the gameplay was simple but masterfully addicting. Not much to do post-story, but it's definitely still worth keeping. Social levers were built into the platform so as not to be a distraction, but isn't just a waste of space either. 111% recommend."", ""This is a strategic rpg game with complex characters and gameplay designed to test your wits. It's a lot of fun and anyone can be a top player. Plus there are always events that grant you exclusive rewards so there's never a dull moment."", 'A good game for both f2p and p2p. The game is very newbie friendly and the ongoing events is pretty luxurious for players. However, only the summon rates and drop rates bottleneck the rest of the game specialty. The rate of getting good unit and good runes is quite low, which requires too much time and effort investment.', ""The game is wonderful and it has God like characters and runes, but the time it took to download and update it took 2 days. I really like it, it's just I had deleted the game twice because either an update was available but I couldn't, or I needed space. Either way I love the game. 😃😃😃"", ""It was a nice game but after 5 years of playing and still i don't have Light And Dark Natural 5 star monster.. com2us always giving you a hope in every event but still always Nat 3 star monster.. you can get LnD Nat 5 monster if you purchase to them..so for me its ok hehe..if i don't have money to buy the packages hehe.. but still THANK YOU COM2US because i found some good friends in my journey of playing this game..keep up the good job..GOD BLESS"", 'This was a ok game but now i cant play i have perfect connection running at 60mbps and every time i load this game it goes to a black screen for 5 mins then sais network cannot be found not the first issue iv had with the game either overall a great game when it works tho. The biggest issue with this game by far is its storage space and the fact that you cant move it to sd card especially with thousands of texture files.', ""This game sux. It can't remember passwords.

Like one time I was watching a raid that I did and it increased my trophies I would like it fixed because that would be way too op. Thx"", ""Overall it's a great game, graphics are really good, controls are easy to learn and use. You get to collect a wide variety of heroes with different traits and abilities, giving you a chance to mix and match teams for campaign and pvp. There is alot to do in this game but the only problem is that you may need to pour in some money once you reach a high level in this game like after level 70 in order to succeed."", ""No more lag!

I would give this game 5 stars if this was fixed.', 'Overall amazing game, but I want to make a hero request. I think you should have a dark character named ""Double Shooter Tinol"" His weapon would be a wand with two sides, so two areas to blast magic. His basic attack would shoot two blasts from his wand that have a 25% chance to disease.

You do the rest. ;)', 'Been playing this game for years no i have an error message saying cant connect to sever please fix as i really dont wont to get rid will change star rating as i fill fit to thanks.

But, it's very newbie friendly. I have found it rather interesting as a gacha game which is a first time for me. Never really enjoyed gacha games as they all pay to win with horrible rates. This is pretty awesome game. However, since the most recent update I cannot seem to get pass the loading screen. Which is upsetting hlvecause I lost my login streak cause I could not log in, still can't login for a few days now. Hope this fixes soon."", ""This game is fun but there's a reason why I'm writing this review. On my tablet I was able to login and play the actual game. But for some reason on my phone it doesn't work and Im stuck on the loading screen which has a black screen. I restarted my phone and the game still doesn't work. If this wasn't a problem I would probably give this game 5 stars."", ""As a person who has played this game for like 3 years now I can say this is probably one of my favorite games. Not everything may be perfect but you get a strong connection with the game and all the amazing players. The only thing that I could possibly dislike is having to spend tons of money for gems but everything else is really fun and just thanks ATeam for making such a great game that I'll carry with me throughout life"", 'The new update to ""balance"" duels out is such a terrible Idea what were you thinking. It is the opposite of balanced. Some classes have way more cp than other classes and they can just take all your hits, for example, soldiers can only get around 800k shield but Berserkers can get 1.5 million and be even more tanky than a soldier could ever be. This isnt balancing this is bs. This update was a total mistake and should be removed immediately.', 'Now, i would rate this app five stars if i could get past the first loading screen and play the actual game. Everytime i try to log in it always gets stuck on the first loading screen. I tried updating it, didnt work, i tried restarting my phone,didnt work, i got as close to my router as i could, and it didnt work.', 'They game is good, easy to level up your character and gain gear plus Gems very free to play. With battle though, it could be more exciting like maybe fast paced and fx could be more improved but story is above average so keeps you playing.', 'Amazing gameplay and art style, some aspects of the game can be confusing for a newcomer to the genre but most if not all questions can be answered on reddit.', 'Great game, but dont play on a tablet. My first experience of this game was on one, and it crashed SO MUCH i never played it again. ...But i strongly reccomend it for phones. ...please fix the crashing thing tho.', ""Really like it, so far very fun and lots of things to do can play continuously without having to wait. Best mmo game on phone that I've found."", 'Great game, but I wish there were more color options for eyes, hair, and that there were different color options for skin, like light green and whatnot!', ""Very fun game and I love that there is character customization. I'm currently on a bad luck streak cause I'm not getting any ssr swords but otherwise very fun and addictive game."", ""4 Years, playing daily. Game is dying, it's getting repetitive. Originally, this would have been 5 stars. Sadly, with the new collabs, they are all lack-luster old content that gives no rewards and are always the same. The only collab that's any fun is the Miku ones, since they have some vibes to them. Overall, I guess I could recommend this. But don't give them money, as A-Team will not put it to good use. When it comes to content, these devs are lazy. Update: A-Team is officialy run by kids"", 'Do not spend a single coin on gems, it is 100% possible to get strong being F2P, it just takes a lot of patience and free time. Every spawn is a trap to try and lure you to spend your earned gems and buy more. They offer ""guaranteed"" gear but spawns are always random and you get stuff that doesn\'t benefit your character at all. There\'s no trading system to offer your gear, the only way to upgrade gear is to grind like mad to get 10 fragments to make 1 upgrade orb/drop, and do avoid Divine Grace.', ""I got this game 3 years ago and it was honestly very fun and addicting. I still play it to this day but I'm kind of getting bored of it since I did all the quests and got all the gems and this game turned into a pay to win game. Also I was trying to do my AteamId again but it says authentication failed. please do something about this, I dont want to lose my account."", ""Pay to win. I've played this game many times for many years. I come back every so often for the collaboration events, but in all sincerity this game is a pay to win. Gems are hard to get, farming is ridiculous, spawns are awful. Beginners find it easily since they are quiet generous in the beginning. Sooner or later it's utterly boring and repetitive. It's sad to see a game then to garbage, the game has turned into an online dating community and toxic. Save yourself the time."", ""Generally I try to keep away from gacha games but this one isnt really pay to win so it's okay in my book. No problems with lag or anything, but the audio quality is a bit low. Very visual game, and a good way to spend free time. Just dont let it consume your life, or your wallet. 4/5 would reccomend."", ""The games is pretty decent in my own personal opinion I've been playing it since 2014 and probably the only game within the play store I'll actually consider returning to it's great with friends, transition is smooth and it's a great time consumer. Apart from it's tedious RNG system and the need to purchase gems to make beneficial head way i don't really see much that needs to be altered."", 'What i like is lots of grinding for material to upgrade and you guys got that. Outfits are cute and plenty, Story so far is not bad at all. :3 Love the game IGN: CruxTheVoiceless', 'I have played this for years and it has been great until recently. The extra features they added are cool and keep long term players interesting but it made it take forever to load. Switching between gears is even a pain to do now because the images take a while to load. Also the new main lobby screen is worse to find things because their burried under categories instead displayed for convience. Please fix the slow loading and few bugs.', ""I enjoy the game well. I joined since late September 2019 and made some decent progress already. I watch ads every 3 hours but now for some reason, the ads for video point spawns aren't working well as usual after the recent maintenance. Can you guys maybe fix the video point spawn ads please? Sometimes it takes days for the ads to be working again."", 'Ive played this game for years and its overall very good and there have been many good improvements and collabs and events BUT. The game has become much much more pay to win with the best gear spawns costing 100 gems for one spawn and a high level player being able to hardly get any gems at all without paying. Id rate five stars if this wasnt the case but instead im uninstalling after 3-4 years of playing.', ""Normally I download apps like these just to play when I'm bored and have some time but I feel addicted to this and I really enjoy the style and story. I like that I can learn skills but I can choose what I want to and when with all the points I can build up. I especially love collecting things that I can use to level up armor and weapons. If I got a weapon I adore the look of but it's weak then I can make it stronger."", ""Played every class in this game twice. Only reason I deleted it was because it takes up alot of storage space. 1 star off because I can't just put it all on my SD card. Amazing game though, recommended to alot of my friends and they got into it too. Best mobile game I've ever played. Characters are also cute."", ""Just got this game--that is my reason for one star missing as I have yet to play it more--but it's super fun so far! I am officially hooked...well played game creators...well played. ;)"", ""All in all it's a really good game sometimes grindy but good gameplay, good job developers"", ""It's a bit confusing at first when it comes to being the character, at first i thought it was a team you built instead of single player. I love the game, its fun and the artwork is amazing"", ""The amount of players that spend so much money is absolutely insane every Saturday they open something called duel rooms basically pvp. But the thing is you will never ever find any players who are at your lvl you are going against players who literally put their life savings into this damn game I searched nope couldn't find a single person all these people are rude too but the amount of sexual role play is a lot and that is pretty disgusting also. Please don't play this there are better games."", ""Altough I hate to admit this... but this game is boring, second this game is lag so much when you have lot gear, third there a bug called connection failed even though nothing wrong with it, it just want to kick u out from server, because the server it self have problem or something, the last thing the dev of this game doesn't really care about all that, what in their mind was makes new mon or gear with higher cost for spawn next week, of course by reduce their rate as low as possible, end."", 'I can\'t log in the game anymore. It keeps saying ""Connection lost"". Wi-Fi nor Data, neither of them works. I don\'t know if it\'s the game or the Wi-Fi & Data that\'s having a problem. If it\'s the game\'s, please fix it.', 'It was a good game, but it became pay to win with extremely low rates for a good or event ssr drop, they use to give one gem as log in bonus but now they just give lures that nobody uses. No free to play friendly', 'This game is adorable! My favorite was the Hatsune Miku crossover! <3', 'loving the game, only issue is after the recent update i couldnt launch my game anymore, im running on a razer phone 2. it was working fine prior to the update but now it just kicks me out whenever i try to enter the app, please help find a fix soon', 'The new patch broke my game and now every time i try to login (despite excellent wifi and full bulgin bars from my data) it says connection failed and restarts the cycle of trying to connect but never connecting. I would love to just get back to the game so if you guys can fix this id much appreciate it.', ""Reminds me of Final Fantasy (my favorite RPG franchise). I'm a tough critic when it comes to games, so for me to give this 5 stars, its definitely worth a gamer's time, one who loves rpg games anyhow."", ""It's great, the animations the game in general is great"", 'Giving me a terrible time when I want to transfer my account and I can\'t and I looked up everything, even from YOUR sources. Did it with better wifi and multiple ways, but I do it ""app is authorized"" and not backup with my account though!', ""Game is great, I've deleted it lots of times but not for bad reasons, it's still great and the collabs are what's really fun about this game, I've logged into fairy tail collab before tho."", 'i got another problem beside game crashing.

I\'ve owned this since it\'s release in 2013 and it\'s as close to Skyrim as you\'ll get on Android. It\'s still better than 99% of the ""open world"" rpg games that were released in the past 6 years. Crescent Moon Games released true art with this and Aralon: Forge and Flame. It\'s a bit clunky, but still revolutionary to this day.', 'I love this game so much! The sound track is phenomenal! I love the ambient sounds in this game. The story is great, the graphics are great for such an old game, and the sound is great! Every thing about this game is great. Please devs, please make a sequel of this game. I will 100% buy it if you do.', 'While it is quite clunky and there are minor glitches I see no reason to hate this game The graphics and locations for a world this large on mobile devices is brilliant the different weapon types add variety to the way you approach combat and the music is fantastic For a mobile game this is extremely good', ""So I made a review and it got removed about the Xbox one controller don't work I click yes to use it then the mountains show up for the menu screen but the start game, load game and options buttons don't show up can't start the game please fix and I'll 5 star it"", ""It is really a rare experience to get on mobile games these days. Even though if it's not the greatest in graphics or in it's software. But the gameplay and the different varieties of goods and weapons are amazing."", ""In my opinion one of the best games on the App Store with a few bugs sure but keep in mind this is an old game and for how long ago this was made the graphics the weapons every bit of the game is interesting there's great storyline people mention that you can see through the map and see through characters that's not a bug that's just part of the game really great game exceptional graphics lots of fun"", ""A dissapointing piece of garbage. Muddy graphics combined with ugly graphic chopping and lack of voice acting make a bad experience. The difficulty is messy and the equipment is TOO basic and lame that i don't feel like a badass. No dual wielding with horrible button mashing. I wasn't expecting a huge pocket skyrim but not like this. Even the Original elder scrolls is better than this hell, online MMO'S are more enjoyable than this. Lucky me it was free when i got it but for others i feel bad."", ""It usually worked on my on my other device but this time it doesn't work on my phone. The game constantly bugs, I can see through the map and characters. It feels uncomfortable to play with the see through map and the problem didn't resolve at all. I downloaded it about 3 months ago , uninstalled it . Reinstalled it yesterday and was still the same problem. I installed and restalled it about 3 times."", 'Update: Developer emailed that a refund is in progress. I did not notice how long since this game had been updated. It does not work on Android 10. I would have loved to play it.', ""I really like the game, graphics are good imo and it reminds me of Skyrim. However it keeps glitching and is currently unplayable. If this is fixed I'd love to keep playing it and give five stars."", ""I played through this several times. I can't lie it is simplistic for an RPG and it lacks depth. But it was still fun and the graphics are surprisingly good for a cell phone game. Even after beating it 5 times I still found secrets and found different rare treasure each time."", ""Hi , I would give this 5 starts but due to the game not being supported on Android 10 I can't , I really liked playing this game and hope it gets an update to fix that issue"", 'Too short, bought it and was done in 2 hours.

Happy I purchased. Got it again for my other phone. Long enough story too.', 'A few bugs. Short as heck and developing my 1 handed ax skills would have been pointless. Other than that... I wish they had a deeper version online. Cos Ravensword ROCKED. straight up Skyrim style. Was looking for it and found it. Thanx 🌙 for offline fun when i had nothing', ""My pixel 3 XL upgraded to droid 10 and now the game doesn't work. Updating to the latest OS is a must for games if you want continued sales. The game was decent on the older OS. I did enjoy it but for anything above 1 star it needs to work on the newer OS"", 'Would be good if it wasnt for the fact that you WILL lose your saves for sure. There are no cloud saves and game CANNOT be backed up (to sd card or cloud storage). So,you are guaranteed to lose all of your progress.', 'Are you kidding me?! Literally, does this game just no longer exist?! It needs new stuff! New updates! I will leave 1 star until something new! Anything, just something!', ""This was a great game until it stopped working because of Android 10, will change rating if fixed. Don't buy if your phone runs Android 10"", 'The game is fine for a game last updated 5 years ago. The graphics are understandable,and the control is pretty smooth. Buuut there is a problem or 2 with the gameplay. To begin with, if you attack a giant in the north, your player stays frozen for a bit, and unfreezes just in time for him to escape the attack. Also,It might take quite long in order to generate an area after fast travel, sometimes making the loading screen freeze. I quit the game while it was frozen, and next time I opened my save file my player was met with the absolute void, and he of course died a few seconds later. I restarted from my last save, only to realize the VOID was my last save. I had been playing for 3 hours. At least you could make it be able to load the save before the last one . One last thing that is pretty annoying is tha fact that you use the exact same face for many npcs. What? Do I play a post-apoxalyptic game where clones have taken all over the map?', ""It's an Excellent game I've known about it for a long time but never wanted to drop $7 not that it's a lot but the game didn't seem to have enough content but I got it for free now after years and I can't complain solid graphics and controls aren't bad you just have to get used to the combat, couple things are wrong with it, it's slightly buggy and I got excited to hear voice acting only to be disappointed by the fact that they only voiced the first sentence, maybe they were trying to conserve space but honestly it's already a large game so you might as well have gone big or gone home. They certainly had plenty of time to update it over time but haven't. All in all pretty good game but I'm glad I didn't have to pay for it especially since even though it cost $7 they still have microtransactions."", 'Please update the game. It has never worked for me. Always crashes at launch. 1 star until updated.', ""I feel like I've been lied to. The sample photos are just that photos, not actual screenshots. The textures in game or actually much less rendered. The gameplay is sluggish, the menus are not well-defined at all, there's absolutely no way of knowing what equipment you have on versus how many more slots you have to fill because there is no equipment display in the game, and worst of all the cash shop items aren't even marked with the prices in real currency. You only find that out after you select it and it tries to get you to purchase."", 'Graphics & controls are really good. Needs better explanation of game mechanics, how to use your skills, how to develop, etc. Stupidly frustrating when it comes to some areas - you are ambushed as you walk in (as soon as area loads) with a maybe 5% chance of getting lucky enough to not die (in which case you easily win). That idiocy has made me quit this game for days at a time, and dropped two stars off the rating', ""Beautiful game! Really surprising in it's detail for a mobile game. It left me wanting more though. Even with the relatively limited world it seemed there were opportunities to have many more side quests and a longer storyline. It almost seemed like a waist to have so much detail and much of it not come into play. There wasn't much purpose to the thieving skills and furnishing the home could have been made much easier. Not much to choose from when it came to high level armor and weapons."", ""I have problems with sensitivity. I have to swipe many time to make the hero turn just a little bit. Sensitivity setting is at max. Very few times it works ok. Please fix this. Looks like a good game so far, but all this effort just to turn arround is making me to just quit. I'm looking forward for a reply. Thank you! 🙂"", 'Very pleasable game, reminds me of oblivion its just looking up and down is very very slow.....i dont like the speed of sensitivity...plzz fix it', 'Played this two or three times now. If anyone is looking for a ES Oblivion like experience. Look no further. Baring in mind this GAME has been out a good few years.... Absolutely awesome. PLEASE PLEASE CONTINUE THE STORY DEVS. 100% recommended', ""Hum. I don't know if it's just on my device Huawei P20 lite. But the textures are messed up. I see through the walls. The controls seems glitchy, I see my head through the helmet. Invisible rocks that guards stands on. I'm just starting the game. I'm happy I didn't pay for that. Im expecting a reply from the devs if they are looking into their players.. EDIT: I've contacted the devs by email, they've fixed the problem in no time ;) awesome gameplay, amazing graphics for mobile, fans of Skyrim, totally worth it. Thanks guys!"", 'Played for a few days. Saved my char in the last city then when it was loading to the next area, the game crashed. When i tried to reload, my char was freefalling and dying from the fall, eventhough tye last saved was clearly in a save area in a city. It keeps on repeating everytime i load the saved game. In other words, i will have to start a new game. 😒', 'Huawei mate 10 pro. The details are amazing but the optimization is SICK! IS 0 ! I can see through the walls, all the objects are everywhere, the map have alot of bugs, I can.t even customize my character without moving it because everything were 3d and I could see even my eyes out from the head. Everything is sick, fix it and you will receive 5 stars because is an amazing game.', 'This game was really good. Updates I would like to see is more items, more side quests, more places to go to and an ending that did not leave you kind of confused.When I killed the last boss the ending was kind of bland that I was wondering ""was that it?"" And the house decorating part of this game is harder than the boss fight... Don\'t get me wrong this is an amazing game, but it could be one of the best games if it had a bit more content! I will still give it a 5 star because, man, was this a really good game. 10/10 would recommend people to play it even at least once.', 'I have the same problem on my hwawei p20 pro with grafics seethrough i can see through doors , it has a bug on all characters faces and everything around me i cannot play it , it is a great game but please do something about the grafics.', ""It's a pretty good game...SPOILERS not to hard to level up in the beginning and quest are fairly challenging. I beat the game in about 2 days during my down time. Best grinding spots for gold is the goblin fort to the right of the eastern forest you can get about 100 gold per goblin after selling the bows($60-70), after mid game grind the dark elves cave, they give you roughly 800 gold per after selling there bows($600-700) and keys($199)...you need to save all runes you pick up during the game because once you equip them you cant unequip them. Dont bother with buying every armor just stick to the leather and grind out some gold once you get to dark elves cave after boss battle itll give you best gear. Raven sword can be found in the statue in the middle of south aven. Best weapon to grind with is BLUNT hammer you can get it in north aven but the ravensword is really the best weapon in the game. I bought both small and large houses and you CANNOT decorate even though you can buy furniture and paintings. DONT WASTE YOUR GOLD LIKE I DID. If there are any questions feel free to email me."", 'I can rate the game with 5 stars as I know it is a great game, but when I want to use the game controller as it detected when I said yes it just got stuck on the introduction screen without showing any functions like New Game... Do fix as the game will be great to play with gamepad as the main purpose and satisfaction is playing it with gamepad.  Please reply!', ""It's a good game but... Why do you still update this on iOS but not on Android as well? It has serious issues like not being able to adjust the graphics besides view distance. It defaults to lowest texture quality. Which makes it look like a PS2 game! And then there's the problem with connecting controllers to it. Where the game doesn't load the main menu after selecting yes. I beg of you please update the game! The least you can do is give people the updates to the game they actually paid for."", ""Rather dire game which is a shame seeing as it's powered by unity, the game graphic is laughable at best due to the skin textures and background textures colliding thus making a merger between the two. If played long enough I think in time it could cause some form of motion sickness In short not worth the time even when being on sell for nothing.."", 'A true, CLASSIC Elder Scrolls style solo RPG. Yeah the graphics could use an HD patch for new phones like they did on next gen consoles for Skyrim, but this game is incredibly perfect if you are looking for a ES clone, it\'s like Morrowind was but with a little less content but it\'s exactly what is refreshing to play after dealing with this ""Money Hungry Freemium FauxRPG"" trend that mobile games have been polluted with. 10/10 Would replay a 2nd time (I went straight magic the first time, I\'m goin all strength and ranged this time)', ""I just finished the game, and while there are a few things to complain about (inventory screen was probably my biggest complaint), it was a great game overall. Granted, I bought it on sale for $2, it was easily one of the best $2 I've ever spent on the Play Store. Fun adventure, really hooked me in, and definitely pulled off some things I had definitely never seen in other games, I was like yea right, this can't be real! (No spoilers, but the last ring and the egg hunting totally caught me off guard in an awesome way). I love Crescent Moon games, so far they have delivered!""]"

I also asked for help from the sod support team and the responded in a very small period of time and they were super helpful, and eventually did manage to solve my problem! I'd totally suggest this game to anyone searching for a great quality game, that always has new updates! ( no I wasn't paid and I'm it a family member w any of the people from sod's team. Just being honest)"", 'The game is really fun. When you start the game you dont have a dragon, but after you complete the tutorial you have a fully grown dragon and a baby dragon. With the membership you get 500 free jems monthly. You allso get all of the expansion packs. Plus Toothless and the Light Fury. I really enjoy this game. Hope you all do to.', ""I love this game, but it is becoming difficult to use. There are almost no normal quests, so I can't level up my dragons. I have been trying to do the holiday quests, but it still takes forever to level up my dragon. It is a pain to try to switch dragons between a flying dragon and my level 9 dragon that cannot fly. I do this in an attempt to level it up, but it has taken at least 6 days to get it even 3 fourths leveled up. There is also a lot of glitches, such as it completly crashing often."", 'Very Good game, love everything in it. However, it would be great if you could add an extension onto the hidden world expansion it was quite short but very good. It would also add effect if you could add dragons flying around the hidden world to make it seem like your actually there.', 'This is one of my favorite How to Train Your Dragon games. But I just said something like ""if you want to race meet me at the large Rock on the blue and purple dragon"", and then it bands me for an hour. It doesn\'t even tell you what word you said is wrong it doesn\'t even give you a list it\'s SO..Annoying! I understand if it\'s a bad word, like a swear word but just for saying something as simple as that and getting banned for an hour is ridiculous! If it didn\'t have that I would give it 5 stars.', 'This game is a very fun thing to have, you get to feel like a real Dragon Rider, to a point. I enjoy flying around on my Hideous Zippleback. You can also choose whatever color you want your dragons to be, my Zippleback is White and Purple and I love it. I suggest you get it. But if you want to do MORE then you will have to pay, like the DLC stuff that is already in the game', ""This is an amazing game, but I gave it a 3 because of 3 reasons and two reasons only, the stables and titan runes. I think that the boulder class stable, which you were able to pay with for 3,000 coin, should stay that way, once you by it with coin, it makes you but it with gems the second time. The titan runes, it's a little to hard to get them, you are either forced to pay with money, or forced to grind out gems. Fix these two problems and I'll give you guys a 5. Please keep the video chests."", ""I adore this game. As someone who has loved the How to Train Your Dragon movies for so long this was so much fun. I do feel that it's a little unfair that to get all of the good stuff without waiting you would need to pay for the membership, and that you don't even get everything with the one month subcription, but it's still possible to get the same things if you're willing to watch an ad every hour. Despite all of this, it's increadibly fun and great for people who need a drawing reference!"", ""I really enjoy playing this game but after the most recent update my game doesn't work properly. I can't do the battles because I can't select my dragon. I am also unable to change to my other dragon or even see them in the stables. Please can you fix this issue because I really like this game and I would like to get one of the night lights."", ""I've been playing ln and off since the very beginning. But, since the member quests and such was added, you can't do a single quest without needing to be a member. I used to lobe the game, but I'm uninstalling it because of everything needing you to be a member. Creators, with all the merchendise and holiday features around, with all the players, I'm sure you get enough money but the member thing? It really sucks.. Was once really fun, but I've only finished two quests so far.."", ""I love this game been in it since the beginning but I'm having way to much trouble staying In the game and not to my own accord. The server times out, I get logged out. It's stupid and needs to be fix other then that the only other thing that I can think of is the baby grunckles the teeth shouldn't cut through their lips and jaw. Love, the player: Disco Morgan."", ""It's a good game for dragon lovers like myself. Although there are a few downsides. Although dragons energy is important it makes it harder when your new and your only flyable dragon has no energy left, I thought a good idea would be to regain energy when in the stables, if that is already a feature its not very effective. Even though fish is a good way to regain energy, bait is hella expensive. Everything in the game is expensive, it rekts the game makes it less enjoyable, encluding membership."", ""I'm enjoying the game and I helped my child make an account and now we cant sign her in because the stupid login doesnt recognize her username or password and I WROTE IT DOWN WHEN WE REGISTERED. So after wasting that time setting up, then the app all of a sudden wont load at all for 2 days. Now it's working and she cant sign in. Just wonderful. I was excited to have a game I could play with her online."", 'I have always love the movies and episodes created by the people who created the how to train your dragon.

If you do then I will be more satisfied with this game. One more thing, way to much data use.. the game is fine but it would be better if u fix.', ""This is really good and awesome game. If you are having trouble finding out something. ( probably not a good question or answer but trying to help) can you do this in the game?? ( please don't kick me out of the game for asking this) can you try you know selling your dragons and eggs to the store to get gold and gems out of it?? You know like you don't want the same stuff or things."", ""I LOVE SCHOOL OF DRAGONS!!!! I PLAY EVERY DAY!!the only downside is that the chat keeps kicking me of for 23 hours because I asked my friend if he wanted to fly with me....this Is very frustrating please fix this please. Another thing when you are changing your dragons color please fix the fact that you have to pay before you change the look of your dragon. Because I don't want to pay good gems on looks of my dragon first....anyway I recommend the game, please agree...and I hope this was helpful"", ""I like this game but the reason I am giving it 3 stars is because it's a pay to play type of game and you need to buy membership for one of my favourite dragons. The skrill. Honestly it would of been better if this game could also listen to the people suggesting things to make the game better. Gems are a huge part because you need a lot of them to get different dragons. Please update this game. Until then, you are probably going to lose a lot of players"", 'I LOVE this game so much i love flying toothless and the light fury and i love that they put the night lights in thats cool so you should atleast give this gsme a try you will like it to!!!!! AND I HOPE THEY ADD THE NIGHT LIGHTS IN AGAIN!!!!!! and if the scool of dragons makers are reading this please add the night lights in again i really want dart the night light and pounser and ruffruner please!!!!!!!!!!', 'Sometimes farm glitches, recently halfway through battle events other players disappear and ship takes no damage. Disappointed that you cant pet the dragons and there arent many things you can do flying like rolls, sometimes the camera is stuck being super zoomed out. I like the battle tactics mini game but wish there was more levels.', 'lIked riding Toothless and getting your own dragon. But they need to fix the fishing part of the game. It takes longer than usual to get a fish and your line either breaks or the fish gets away. They need to make it easier. Maybe get the fish on your first try? Oh, and can School Of Dragons please please please please allow people to get the Light Fury for free or something like 89 gems?! Please', ""A great game altogether. The downside is it is heavily pay-to-play. New maps are very expensive, takes a long time to save gems for rare items (even common ones), and no way to get them at all for those who play for free. Encouraging the developers to have something for those who can't afford the top ups. A little more free-to-play friendly, it's good to go. All in all, good game."", 'The only downfall of this game, is that the chat system is a complete mess. I try to type, any word, from ""Hi to ""That\'s cool"", it still blocks any word I say. To begin, it doesn\'t even let me type at all. I could be typing with the keyboard, and the message just doesn\'t send. Same with sending clan messages.', ""It's a great game, for someone like me who loves dragons it's the closest I'll get to owning my own. The only downside is that everything is so expensive unless your a member. if you can't afford to be a member then you gotta save for months to be able to afford any dragons that cost gems. the prices are really the only downside to this game but if you don't care about that then its a great game all round"", ""It's really such a shame bc this would be an AMAZING game if not for how much it lags and glitches. I can't even use my farm because it won't let me click on anything when I go into it. If I could, I'd give this a 2.5/5. Half the quests you can't complete unless you are willing to spend an insane amount of crystals/ money on them or become a member... Which is also insanely priced. Still, I'd be willing to overlook that if only the game didn't malfunction every five minutes."", ""Nearly every quest you have to pay or be a member to be able to continue,and every time i download the game i get the same dragon.But the only good thing about the game is that the baby dragons are cute but i keep on feeding the baby dragon but it won't grow but i wan't it to grow so i can mount it!!!"", ""Ok I let my dad no what happen and it was as card for some reason we think it was the Google play store having trouble with it but it was a SD card problem with it. What I did is take out the SD card then turn on my phone then install the school of dragons app and it work. Then I put the SD card back into it's place. Also sorry about the emails I did not no maybe they might want to add that into the support list on forms also this is tornadochaser just so you no."", ""it's fairly fun to play. the only problem is the facts that everything there is so expensive, and the quests you accept take you to places where you need to pay to enter. not to mention, it lags at times and it keeps saying that it needs to download new resources but the download never works. please fix this..."", ""It's so fun it helps me when I'm stressed like it's the best game ever so you can really it's like a school for like humans but you can have your own and dragon that's why I'm giving you this rate my favorite game in the whole universe like it helps me when I'm angry or stressed cuz it's the the best game ever"", ""Well I was enjoying it till it kicked me put and it won't let me log in, saying my username and password don't match, not to mention the forgot password don't work it says internal server error please try again later could it please get fixed I want to play my Character again and play with my dragons. If it doesn't get fixed people are gonna stop playing it. Other than that the quests are ridiculous because you made it for membership only its expensive lower the price or drop the membership stuf"", 'I love this game, and I have an idea for the next expansion. What if, the dragon we get, is a shadow wing. Or, a small shadow. I LOVE the idea of adding shadow dragons to the game. And I love the hidden world l. And all the other beautiful worlds.', 'I think this game is very good and is my faveroute. There are no issues with the game eccept the fact of how much gems cost. Apart from that, best game ever. I like the way the game is planned as the way that the creators used the real voices and the animations on rhe dragons are INCREDIBLE!!! Highly reccomended.', 'Fun idea but poorly made. The game is laggy nothing works, you keep getting logged out, your dragons keep dissapearing and event are overpriced and not working. The customer support is terrible, nobody gives a normal response and they dont even try to fix the bugs. Dont waste your time and money on this trash game. The developers need to finally wake up. Very, very bad. I wish i could give -5 stars.', ""Okay so... I installed this game a couple of years ago and I enjoyed playing it, but now when I returned back to my game I realised that it's just pay to play... most of the worlds and quests need to be unlocked by paying an insane amount of diamonds or by paying for membership which is rediculous. It would be more fun if there was a way to unlock these new quests and wolds by finishing others... I love this game but I would like this pay to play thing to change"", ""Not only is this game packed with overpriced subscription fees, but the graphics look ancient and it is laggy and constantly malfunctioning. These do not do the concept of the game much justice and it would be nice to see improvement especially in the graphics. I used to love this game when I was younger, but now I see that it hasn't as much as I thought it would, which is quite disappointing. I love How to Train Your Dragon ever since it came out and as much as I want to, I don't love this game"", ""The game is amazing but it kept kicking me out. Also, I don't really like the way the view is. The graphics aren't the best, but they're no too bad. It wont let me update it, even after I deleted three apps. It's really expensive and sends you on missions you can only complete if you're a member."", 'good a bit to glichey but other than that would recomend and might want to open a test server for the game that way people can test it out and see if the game is Worth getting. also might want to drop some of the prices for the none members, just something to consider it MIGHT make the game a LITTLE more fun but that is just my opinion. But over all good game', 'I love this game but I have some ideas/suggestions to update your game. My first suggestion is to have a dragon breeding place in the hatchery to create new hybrid dragons(Example: Speed Stinger and Flightmare make the Dreadstrider OR the Boneknapper and Skrill make the Skrillnapper). My last suggestion is adding all 3 Night Light Dragons on to the 6 and 12 month membership for Sod. Please consider these ideas and I hope to hear from you soon.', 'When I first started, I was completely unknown in the game but know almost everyone and everything knows who I am and who everyone else is. U get to play with friends and defend the training grounds and rescue your own dragons in the beginning and throughout all of the quests. U also get to raise baby dragons and watch them learn to fly. U get to earn age ups where u get to age up your active dragon instantly. U also get to buy age ups and titan age ups in the store. I REALLY recommend this game', ""This game sucks! The storyline is confusing. The missions are also confusing. The graphics suck! Not to mention evrything is glitchy. The the dragons are WAY to hard to steer and control. The characters look hideous. The way everything moves is weird. I'd honestly expect more from this game when i downloaded it. I feel like this game could have potential but right now it sucks.""]"

ⓒ 2020 MARVEL","['I really liked the game. Every thing is good and nice except for the graphics(eg: when iron man moves, the machinery that you can see moves. Like you can see it near the arm). The game has also lost its fun factors after the recent update. Earlier in the story mode, you were free to select your team, but now, you are stuck with iron man, captain America and black widow. Maybe you could remove this.', ""2 years ago, this game used to be considered as one of the best online mobile games. I'm really sad and disappointed at the poor direction the game is heading to, especially with its most recent updates. In terms of character & game design, this game is brilliant. Sadly, not much can be said about actual gameplay. The developers need to plan updates carefully before releasing them and should make sure these updates involve meaningful changes involving gamemodes, not just boring repetitive ones."", ""This used to be my favourite game ever. I played for hours every day. But then the updates started changing and I stopped playing often. I maybe started playing about 2 times a week for about 10 minutes. It started to get worse so I deleted it for a while and download again today and my god. They have absolutely ruined everything in the game. I'm not mad, I'm just disappointed. Oh wait never mind, I am mad. Just make the game good like it used to be, then I'll be back. Please,😔 Goodbye......"", ""Its a very nice game , i enjoy it playing. But the game won't let me connect to my Facebook account, whenever i click on connect to Facebook button instead of showing log in option it shows forgot password and creat new account page. Please fix the issue as i could not connect to my friends. Edit:- Thank u guys for resolving the Facebook login problem. 5 stars from me. Have a great day."", ""One of the few F2P games that actually gives away items to keep loyal players interested and able to keep up with P2P players. The developers are more than generous and if you're patient, the daily gems stack up fast! It's very possible to gain just about everything in this game if you put the time in and that's not saying one has to put in a ton of time. However, as with all things, there are ways to pay and get things faster but it doesn't impact the PvP aspects much."", 'Decent game but not free to play. You need to spend about 30 dollars a month. But reason for my low score is that as of a patch about 3 months ago the loading screens on several game modes went from 20 to 30 seconds to 2 to 5 minutes. This makes the game extremely annoying to play and I am calling it quits after waiting several months for them to fix.', ""Improvements need to be made to all the game modes. As it stands now we have 200+ characters in game but literally no where to use any of them!!!!! It's gotten to the point that the characters are the only content in the game that is really worth experiencing. Please allow us to use our characters in meaningful game modes with good rewards."", ""They completely destroyed the game with the 5.8 update. Players have been asking for new things to do for years, and all Netmarble did was nerf the top characters to make the existing modes harder so it takes us longer to complete them. That's not what we want! This is not a fix, it's lazy and manipulative. Netmarble only cares about money, not its player base, and I'm never spending money on this game again. AVOID"", 'Always disconnect from server. Come on!!! I pay for this game!! Fix it!!! It not bcoz of wifi. Coz its only happens to some character especially premium character (New review) Mode that should be improve is World Boss Invasion and Giant Boss Raid. This 2 mode always lagging and disconnect from server. Other mode so far so good.', ""This is (or was) my favorite Marvel game ever made, but the devs keep ruining it every update. taking away things I enjoy and replacing it with something I'll do once or twice and never again (ie. Story mode) I've spent a lot of money in the game which I never do, but they really need to start listening to players feedback. Make abx and alliance conquest better, fix the balance with older characters. Make bleed useful or get rid of it.. etc"", ""I've playing for a few months now and I love it, the character selection is constantly growing with the updates witch gets me excited to see if one of my favorites has joined the games universe. Only complaint is the character selection is small at the moment & focused more on recent characters but that's to be expected and I only hope that future updates bring more classic characters & costumes. The game play is also unique & fun in my opinion of course. One love all."", ""At this point feels like pure bait n switch, the changes to game modes and direct nerfs to characters after you spend money on them. Introducing rules then changing them 2 months later after ppl spend money....used to enjoy this game as of 2/12 update doesn't even seem like the same game anymore. Will not spend money on this game again due to these predatory practices."", ""What the heck is this new update?! The new way of playing the story is trash! You can't even choose your own characters! I enjoyed the old way much, much more. If you want to play a game where you do not choose your characters in the story mode and it has multiple modes this is the game for you. I only put 2 stars because this only applies to story mode on no other mode except legendary battle."", 'The game is decent enough but some modes are a boring slog or just broken and pay to win like timeline battle. But the one star is given purely for the fact the developers are utter liars and thieves. And just plain dont listen to the community. Example, i purchased something and never got part of it. I contacted support and they tell me their ""logs"" say i havent completed the content to unlock the stuff and received everything. Which is just a flat out lie. and they refuse to refund too.', ""Update 5.8 is terrible. It's a gamble game, everything is so random. I would prefer to spend 10.000 crystals to get the card I want than spend 670 crystals to maybe get a premium card or garbage. Please fix that, it's so frustrating. The same with CTPs, ccf drops, every chest, almost everything in this game is 10% strategy, ability and log every day, the other 90% are just luck or spend money. Luck is supposed to be 10% of a game! To play poker you need less luck than mff!"", 'After recent updates, the game has lost its fun factor. Most reviews have already covered the issues. One additional issue that I dislike is the removal of the option of one-handed mode. I can understand this being disabled in some game modes, but is another change in a long list of changes that have made the game far less enjoyable for me personally.', 'Tons of heroes, power ups/equips, and modes. Has depth, but the menus are terrible to navigate, terrible at teaching you even the basic or useful parts of the game. This game is complex and doesnt hold your hand at all, but while the system and mechanics being complex adds depth to the game which is great, the more complex a game is, the more advanced the guide should be to teach you. Maintenance times are long compared to other games I play like Duel Links, which is further irritating.', ""Please try to listen to the community. These new update changes have triggered a lot of players, go read some posts on the forums, people ranging from star agents , your big spenders to f2ps, complaining about the changes you've made by reading the patch notes. I love this game, but if you could just play your own game you would know. Nerfing the toons is worst. Even worse when the nerfed character is none other than Doctor Strange(most of them have ctp of rages). Please listen to the community"", 'New update ruins core mechanics of the game and makes it very unenjoyable. It takes away the hard work people have put into building up characters and makes favourite game modes unplayable. The so called improvements to game modes are not improvements at all and there is no changes to rewards which all players want.

Lots of game modes to help players learn the ropes, level up and play their own way. The monthly sealed leagues and draft format level the playing field while your collection is small, and keep all of the cards you open. Very f2p friendly. Highly recommended.', 'This free-to-play really is as great as advertised. Tons of cards, easy ways to get free packs/cards every day, lots of play options, frequently updated, and no ads to interrupt the fun. What more could anyone want? I have been and will continue to play this daily. Thanks for making this awesome game!', ""After years of Hearthstone I've been looking for a decent alternative, on PC I found MTGA overly complicated, with poorly worded text on the cards and cumbersome mechanics1. Eternal seems to have got the balance just right using mechanics from both. Looking forward to getting my middle ages teeth into this."", ""I'd say this is one of the best mobile card games, competing with Hearthstone for the top spot. I love how budget friendly it is, especially draft game mode, and that you can buy entire decks in the store. Gameplay is fun, keeps me playing for hours. Great game overall."", 'Eternal is about as generous as it gets as to what you can get for free or without grinding for hours and hours. On top of that the gameplay is fun and rewarding.

Eternal is exactly the same game, just with different words of terminology. For example: in MtG, ""lands"" provide ""mana"" to cast spells. In Eternal, ""sigils"" provide ""power"" to cast spells. This is obviously for legal reasons, so the developers can avoid getting a lawsuit by the MtG creators.', ""It's a good game. Not perfect. I purchased a founders pack years ago so you can trust me when I say I know the game inside out. Most of the people complaining about it being too hard have never played Magic or have no idea how to play a card game that doesn't hold your hand like Hearthstone.

Git gud."", ""Edit: I'm removing one star due to increasing connection issues. It's becoming more common where it will disconnect and not reconnect in the middle of a game.

If you're losing, your deck sucks or you're getting bad luck that game, not because anyone is cheating. Difficult to build a great deck, easy to play, very difficult to master."", 'The forge play mode seem obviously designed to limit your winnings.

Thats just ridiculous for what the campaigns give.(up to 16 levels for some, up to 20 for another. Keyword ""up to"". Also thats 20 matches. Dont think its actual missions with multiple matches.nope. 20 matches for close to 15$.) Mobile games have become ridiculous. All rip offs, cash cows, p2w schemes and stamina schemes.

I've been playing for a little over half a year and hit top 250 masters at one point with my own deck.

Can I suggest to the devs to update your app image?

Id have no problem resetting my account and having to get the cards again... Except you cant for some reason. Theres no ""reset"" for your account. So now i have no cards and i have no way to earn new cards because my level is too high and it takes forever to earn anything. I dont undsrstand how this happens.', 'This is a game with potential, however two stand out complaints drive me close to uninstalling on many occasions. First is deck composition rules: instead of flat number requirements like MTG (whose mana system eternal uses), eternal forces you to to have mana proportional/fractional to at least one third of your deck. This makes it highly likely you get hit by mana flood. The second is that out of all the digital CCGs eternal has an exceptionally bad shuffling algorithm.', 'its a great game, with tons of depth and a wonderful selection of janky cards for fun and semi competive off meta builds. The game does struggle with the issue of certain cards being pushed and power creep is certainly visable between sets. the games f2p model is generous and rewards daily play. all in all the game has faults but the many many benefits and positive aspects out way them.', ""This used to be a really good game, but the developers are ruining it with new broken game mechanics that basically allow players to circumvent the general gameplay strategy and coast to an easy victory with 2 or 3 cards...this is almost consistently done through the use of specific cards only unlockable through the new pay to win system. In other words, if you're not shelling out cash for cardpacks riddled with virtual mechanical cheats, then your win probability has plummeted with these added."", 'So first off, fun game. If you enjoy magic or hearth fire great game. However, it has a serious issue with ""shuffling"". I will go 10 games seeing the same cards from my deck. Not seeing many others. Or only seeing some once in awhile despite having copys in my deck. I will also go game after game drawing only power sigils. Or only monsters. How in a deck of 90 do I draw 10 power cards in a row??? Again it\'s fun. But there are days that it\'s very frustrating.', ""Every game is definitely not random card selection. It's always set up for one player to win. Very frustrating when you get into it. You might not notice at first but you'll soon start to see it happen"", 'Best digital card game I have ever played, and I tried MTGA/MTGO, HS, TESL, Shadowverse and LoR! Love the incredible amount of different game modes and how you can play everything without spending a cent. Just amazing..', 'Game was fun until I realized that my favorite mode forge was completely rigged. The enemies have preset hands while you have to fight rng. You make your deck with rng, power is added to your deck through rng, you then draw all hands through rng while the enemies are guaranteed preset decks, and then guaranteed to draw units and power.', ""The game, at an initial glance is good and interesting. However, it quicky becomes apparent this game has nasty flaws. Given a review post limit, I cannot list them all. There is one however, I'd warn (unless you're one those cancerous people whom condone the effect) about. This game has a Mill-loss mechanic. Which for the victim of the Miller is little more then sitting back and watching the Mill player fornicating themself. Good idea, bad game implementation, with Auto-Win/Loss like that. 1/5"", 'Fun game. It is much more like MTG than hearthstone, but with enough differences to not be a copy of MTG. At first I was having a great time playing. Eternal has a lot of free gold and packs to earn. But, I was disappointed to see how many cards are only available from buying campaigns. It is possible to grind for the gold without purchasing, but the amount of gold needed for campaigns is very high.', ""Eternal is a fun CCG that has elements of both MtG and Hearthstone, but unique in its own way. Regardless what others are saying, you dont need to pay for card packs and expansions, as you can buy 'em with coins that you get at the end of every win. Truth is, it can take a while, but as one of the free to play players, that owns all expansions, i can guarantee it. Very fun game, with a lot of various deck builds. I wholeheartedly recommend it."", 'Super impressed with this game. Great work.', 'One of the most underrated CCGs in my opinion. Feels like a perfect mix of the other popular Card Games on the market now plus has a more generous market structure. Very easy to go free to play and still hit high ranks. Highly recommend!', 'It\'s like the baby of MTG and Hearthstone, and sucks a little less. The ""lands"" you use to play spells is set up way better than MTG\'s, and it\'s pretty f2p. Also, I like how it seems a better system than MTG Arena. Deck creation is great, and they have a comperable amount of cards per set. Drafting is fun as well, and most other players have been incredibly nice during play. Great game, 11/10, will keep playing for sure. Will stop playing magic, too.', 'this is the best gaming app. the music is so so and the maps are kinda all dark colors,,but this is the best gaming app. you have more time to complete most games. you can make the games speedy if you like.', ""Epic helpful support team only wish is when I decide to take a brake I wish my missions could stack wish it took less space.... Advice for the devs in Deck view mode please add an option to clear the deck while in the deck view so we don't have to tap on every card to clear it"", 'Reinstalled game, and got back to playing. After playing long enough, got the feel how to counter flying decks. Now the only thing that makes me want to stop playing is, that more often than not you either get stuck with the power you had on your starting hand, or you end up drawing only power cards, both that ruin your game pretty spectacularly.', ""I don't really do comments, but this card game is amazing! I've been playing with CCG for ages and this game really deserves probably more than 5 stars well balanced and really generous as well.. Its basically a free game that you can grind and get cards you need plus playable on almost all platforms. That said, I will still spend money on it not only because of getting a head start but the purpose of mainly supporting the team and the brilliant brains behind this masterpiece."", ""Draw ratio can be a little frustrating(try to find a card game mana system that isn't) but overall a very well polished and rewarding free to play card strat. Great artwork and mechanics, dont have to pay a cent if you dont want to..... asterisk for online play, still very pay to win but what can you do. More choices for less expensive single player game modes would be nice and as a final positive I am really enjoying the deck builder, easy to jump right in and get building"", ""It's a great game but the deck shuffling is very unbalanced. It's always either too much power and not enough units or too many units and not enough power. I had a deck of 30 power and 45 units, weapons and spells. I minimized power because I was getting too many in a row but still have the same problem"", ""I gave this 5 stars when I first started playing. But now its become a pay to win game. There are certain insanely overpowered cards that you can only acquire if you spend the money for expansions. Buy a bunch of copies of the same card and then just build your deck around those cards. If you're going to penalize players that are just looking for a fair fun free game at least make it so that they can spend shards on the premium versions of the card. Its a shame its always about the money."", 'Incredible game straight from the desktop. A worthy contender to magic the gathering. Links to a central account so you can play from your PC or phone.

BTW in my device (mobile telephone) the sound/music are completely broken."", 'Fun game, but I\'ll echo the common sentiments of most of the game being ""paid"". What\'s worse, you literally cannot unlock the paid features when you have Google PlayPass because it removes in-game purchases.', 'I really enjoy this game! I like how there are different ways to play, and that I can play for more coin even though I don\'t ""lose"" often.', ""I would give it 5 stars, however because of my screen set up I can't see my coin total so I'm never sure how much I have. But that's my only complaint, otherwise it's super fun and just the right amount of challenging."", 'Don\'t get me wrong. It\'s a great, fun game. I would totally recommend for my friends EXCEPT by the fact that the game is not free, but hidden behind a ""free game"" disguise. I really hate to download a game and after a few matches receive the message ""Surprise! The game\'s not free and you need to buy to continue playing!"". I love the game, but hate the marketing choice.', 'Amazing vector graphics and art style. Love it. Some of critique: Animations can be made shorter for the snappier feel of the gameplay.', ""Fun and enjoyable! I have played a few of his games and they don't dissapoint! Very unique and they do a great job explaining how to play. Awesome artwork. The creators and developers should be proud!"", ""A nice core concept, but lacks depth. Different monsters that have special effects (Can't be targeted by spells, can't be blocked by shields, etc.) would help add some depth to the otherwise basic number crunching. Additionally, you have no idea what RNG picks the game will give you for ability cards. Some, Shield Bash, can solo win an entire run, while others only serve to increase your score, and a few can even get you killed!"", ""Pretty good game, although I would prefer to know when a 'free' game is actually a demo for the paid game. Don't get me wrong, I am all for paid games when they are worth it, but prefer to know it before I download them. Aside from that, everything is awesome and enjoyable."", 'Fun game without worrying about running out of content. Completely worth the $5! The free version is just a taste of all the content that comes with the full version.', 'A very easy-to learn card-ish game, Card Crawl uses the theming of a dungeon crawler, and the limitations of a (modified) deck of cards to create a compelling game of risk and reward, where the pursuit of a high score means gambling on disposing of valuable resources. While the RNG will occasionally lead to impossible-to-win runs, the quick turnover from session to session, and steady progression of fun and brain-teasing card unlocks keeps the grind from feeling onerous. Highly recommended.', ""Game was excellent up until recently. Only issue that I'm having now is that the sounds and music have been replaced with a continuous robotic hum. This issue persisted through and uninstall and a reboot so it may be device specific. I'm using a OnePlus 7 Pro. If this issue is fixed rating will go back to 5*."", ""I want explanations for everything aside from the main gameplay, but even so, I'm hooked! It's quick, clever, and looks great. I love the art."", ""It's okay. Pro tip you'll have to take damage from high hitting monsters. None of the weapons (from what I've played so far) can slay 9 and 10 hp monsters in one hit. Take the damage from big monsters and use swords and shields to take out low hp monsters. Recommend keeping a high level potion in your backpack til the last 10 cards in the deck."", ""Very fun. It's not for RPG fans, but for fans of card games it will provide enjoyment in bursts of perfect length for a phone game."", ""Fun game. Sound is all digitized and can't listen to it. Have to mute everything. Update 12/23/19: still digitized, but not in Bluetooth mode."", ""I really enjoy the game but after a lot of hours spent on it I wish there was a little more to it, I've been trying to unlock the other two heroes but it's taking so damn long! Always playing with the regular knight can get a bit stale in the long run. But I really love the artwork and music and general feel of the game!"", 'Nice concept, easy to understand while also sometimes challenging If I had to say something negative about the game it would be that some ability cards seem fairly useless', 'Easy to play but fun enough to hold my interest. I like that there is unlimited gameplay without a bunch of ads.', 'Great game. Cheap for lots of additional content if you get bored.']"

The only draw back at all is the in game pay to play as its called its difficult to get cards you want without paying or putting huge amounts of your time into the game the one card per win is a little behind as well could at least give three. But having said all that the game as far as play is exceptional in my opinion.', 'Updated* bought a few things from the shop and when i went to duel i couldnt even do anything, like i tried to touch my cards and my hero and the other duelers hero and nothing happened! nothing was responsive. Waste of my time i had to close the app because nothing worked. Bummer i was gonna spend real money on this fun game', ""I did enjoy this game a lot and I put a TON of time into it. I had built up a lot of cards and had 6 Hero's unlocked. Now today I go to open the app to play and all my heroes are gone and I see the first screen u see the first time you play, asking me to pick a hero, as if I had never played before. I had 6 decks I built up over at least 50 hours of gameplay, and all of a sudden it's just gone. Other than this issue it's a 5 star game, but a bug like this ruins it, 1 star until its resolved."", 'This game is great but no more update since years ago.

Fast to learn and very annoying if you dont like these sorts of games . For a card game is the graphics on point! People who like strategy games will say this is the best game on google play store', 'Nice game but two major and issues: 1. While playing games gets hanged, not the phone but the game. Player who quits first will win the game. 2. While playing normally, without any network issues, you will see message defeated, means ur game over without any reason.. Apart from these few cards are made extremely hard to defend against.', ""The potential of this game is immense... But it's neglected. When are you going to come with some updates??? None has been done since it appeared, in 2013... It's such a shame, this is a beautiful game... :("", ""The game lies and says that it needs access to your contacts in order to log into Google Play.

I log in with my usual facebook acc and it just begins from zero. This is so unfaaaaair! I've been playing this game for ages and since you guys don't even bother paying a little bit of attention to this game and not launching any update, I'd at least expect you to respect my progress and not delete it just like that. :("", ""I seriously don't have a clue why you have 4,4 stars.. Some cards ain't working correctly and your game is on air for so long... That is unacceptable. I give you 1 star coz the game is so bad."", 'This is a fun game I used to play ages ago and I want to start playing it again but I do not want to give the app permission to access my media ..this needs to change and access to media needs to be optional ..please fix this', ""Requires access to contacts under the pretext of logging into google play. What a joke; either the devs are incompetent or they're tying to take contact details off your device without you realising it."", ""ROFL, they require the Contacts permission to even open the app, what a joke of an app and a joke of a company. 1/5 and instant uninstallation, don't waste time in this garbage"", 'This game is pure perfection, but u guys are ignoring it, its been ages since any update, the game was great but u guys just woke up one day and decided to kill the game, now no one plays it because of you abandoning the game, any minor update and ill change to five stars, just dont let the game die like this.', 'Its ok, fine to distract, you get involved because of the cards and the story, but gotta find so much ruins, lvl 17 by now', 'Nice game but it still same from many years it required a new update other wise we feel boring by playing the same and old game', 'Honestly, I love card games. This was one of the best but the further you get in the game the more annoying, ridiculously overpowered cards the opponents get and the more stupid their abilities become. Rather than making the challenges smarter, they opted for brute force and basically making you suffer because ""why not"". It\'s frustrating at best. There are tons of blatantly overpowered cards that you just won\'t ever get but the enemy seems to have in swathes, so you\'re left with no chance.', 'I have played this game for years.Definitely fun.Only real problem is the ""Tower"".Where you get 3 chances to fight person on person to win better gifts,often while waiting for a player or when the game is just about to start it shows that you lost without even playing.Because this has been happening for years,I gather the developers don\'t play the game to identify this problem.So I suggest not buying any of the material used to enter the Tower(40pieces), as you will be throwing your money away.', ""It's a good game i like it but want i don't like about it doesn't give you more gold or gems but i like the game"", ""Good game but you can't get very far without spending a lot of money. Time to uninstall."", ""I really loved this game.... I'm playing this game for last 4 years but when u play in tower some people hacks the game and u lose without playing a single card... this has been done many times... till not fixed....

The servers are bad, the friend system is confusing, and collecting daily rewards is a hassle. The UI can be vastly improve upon.', 'Good game but multiplayer mode is boring! We have to wait to long to find a opponent. Sucks!!!', 'Crashing all the time, cant find any opponent for multiplayer, heroes are locked behind money and it is pure luck to choose starting one, cant try new heroes, campain dont give any good cards, gaining new cards is almost impossible esspessialy with comparion with other games that gave you lots of free cards and rewards in the begining to to try diferent things. very poor rewards from campaigns and daily logins, no goals and challenges for cards. gameplay is repetative with nothing original.', 'Requires access to contacts and tries to cover that as requirement to log in google play!', 'Great!!! Just need to do some upgrades. Add some new cards or add new enemies to fight. Not any hard ones😂😂', ""Good but it's a shame so much is behind pay schemes and it's hard to get any gems otherwise or coins."", 'Great flow. Needs more variety in cards but the game is fun.

Wth, why would I play then if I can't buy packs? Oh, you want me to spend real money? How about NO."", 'Great Game but hard to find players to battle though. Been playing for a week and season keeps saying will start shortly. Dont know if its a bug or what.

Leave a review or contact our Customer Support by visiting http://www.withhive.com/help/inquire.","[""Its CCG and gatcha, and yet its unique, fun, and there's a lot of freebies and events that whaling is not a necessary component to play. I love the art. It does take a while to build good teams, and can be a bit overwhelming at first. The reason for this is that there is a lot of variety in play styles and team comps. But once you have some solid teams for farming and slightly harder game content, theres always more challenges in PvP. Put those thinking caps on, strategy matters in this game."", ""I've been playing this game for more than a year now. All I have to say is, if my account ever got reset/deleted I honestly wouldn't even be mad because I would just be able to everything all over again.

I just love this game."", ""Bunch of BS. Took about 1 hour 30 minutes to download data needed to start game and then once I download data it closes all my background running apps and when I login it tells me I need to choose a nickname, but keyboard doesn't work and a nickname is required to create my account. Don't download this if you wanna waste an hour of your time."", ""If you want a game where the Devs don't care about you then this game is for you, lackluster content, plagued with latency issues and overall terrible game balance, also worth mentioning there are roughly 250 players that the game devs don't care about which are every 2-4 star player in the game. In closing the only amazing thing about this game is how long it has lasted so far which as this review is 5 years..."", ""Super great game, and i have been playing it for 4-5 years, with some breaks on and off. But very good game, but only bad thing is that it crashes sometimes, but not as often as you'd think."", ""Why would you make a game that only crashes every time you want to download files. The game itself looks fun but if you can't even get past the download stage then it isn't worth the damn time you waste. Im friggn done with this sht. I'm going to search for a game that actually works!"", ""EXTREMELY pay to win. There are some skins you can't get without shelling out $100. Hard pass, pun intended. Minue the pay to win aspect, it's still a pretty fun game. (EDIT) They've gotten better at freebies and there's usually an event going on which is nixe, still salty about the $100 skins but oh well"", 'why this game downloading so SLOW!! 300mb additional data feels like downloading 2.5gb file. my connection is just fine in other game downloading 350mb++ didnt take more than 5 minute. in this game just 1% taking time more than 1 minute WTH!', 'A game worth putting time an effort in. Entertaing and so many vários teams that you can make.

First of all no matter what game it is theres always difference between the one who paid for stuff and play for free and the fact that the f2p want to have the same as p2p is just plain retarded, second yeah the legendary rate is quite unfair playing f2p for almost 5 years i only have 4, third is pvp is all about ME-', ""It was great all the way tbf but one thing that frustrating me is your guide quest especially for long pass. I ranked 50+ already and I thought to pass and try it again soon as finish the chapter. Now, I'm finished and I'm struggled to do that guide. Was it supposed to be enemy first move? Could you change the possibility? I hv done so many ways yet I still can't use long pass. Thank you. EDIT: I passed. I took long enough xc"", 'Never stuck to an app game for so long. since 2014. In my experience, I didn\'t have to pay to play to advance. Eventually for really addicted and invested into the game. But never have I regretted spending money and later feeling bad or as if I lost something. Will continue to play even if I take a break every now and then. Would 100% reccomend to those who are more drawn to these ""type of games"". P.s would love if they could improve the club system so we can have more contact with each other.', ""This game is absolutely horrible with balancing players. Early on the game may seem good, but when you get to the PVP aspect of the game it's horrible. The flaws really show with the current state of the game. You will run into the same teams on Gold League that you should be able to beat. But guess what? EVERYONE runs a mono legend team with OHKO or just uses a Thor ace with her broken passives. This game really needs a huge patch with just balancing. Oh, they also have a Zombie loop in pvp!!"", ""Please do something about the package sales popup. Everytime enter the game, it always appear and it's really annoying and eyesore. 27/11/2019 server maintainence taking so long. If calculated, 10hour total maintainence.

The people who are responsible for the art and the trailers of this game have my admirations. Game wise it is acceptable considering you can go auto in the story mode and host to gain additional players while you are away of the game. Statistic wise the legendary players are difficult to get but not impossible. If you gather crystals and tickets and await for the percentage to go up in draw you might get one. Patience is key.', ""This game is no longer in a state worth playing. It's gotten to the point it is just releasing a new OP character, and then two weeks or a month later there is a Nerf and possibly another new OP character released as a hard counter. This process has just been repeating over and over again with no stop in sight. The company is just trying to milk this game as much as it can at this point. There was a time it was worth playing... There was a time..."", ""I like tactical games, and this is one of them, however, prices for skins, crystals, etc are quite a big sum that most other games that have a similar system don't charge as much, but if you like soccer/football, and/or tactical games, this is an alright game."", ""I really liked the game but now I started to hate it. I spent around 4000 crystal and I didn't get a single legendary player how can that be. There are teams full with legendary players how is that possible. Its either that the game is full of hack or there is a huge problem with the game. I am really disappointed."", 'Since last update, cannot play the game without WiFi, saying unstable network... It worked fine before that update.... Beside that, grindy game but interesting concept.', 'Played for 5 years at 1st the game was fun then the P2w stuff became more unbearable. You have to hab a 6* char (dalgi) for you to even have a chance, balancing is trash i might quit because no longer find this game fun but more of a grind (gatcha is trash 0.002% for a 6*) if your f2p stay away... (i hate the meta of this game its all the same boring stuff)', ""I'll write a proper review in like an year from now, that's about the average speed it takes for this game's developers to do anything that isn't trying to milk whales"", 'The game is difficult to play competitively because of p2w, but the game is lenient to how you can achieve greatness with persistence.

Overall it's fun game but don't get your hopes high for legend cards because it's soo hard to get."", ""I don't know why but somehow it's not letting me play anymore.

Full patch notes: www.playhearthstone.com","[""Where do I start, I know how about the loading screen. You'll spend more time there than playing the actual game. Constantly being disconnected all the time, then having to restart the app just so it can happen again. Real fun, good times. This the third try I gave this game over the years, well no more. If you value your time don't bother."", 'Great game, truly. I have a lot of fun playing it even if a lot of people love to deride it. However, the Android app is absolutely awful. Seriously. Awful. It crashes sometimes I guess, but for the most part it just ends up unresponsive at loading screens. Like half the time that I open the app it hangs and I have to stop the process and open it again. It is incredibly frustrating. It also will have bizarre visual glitches at similar times, like corrupted NES stuff.', ""In short, this game is fun, but it does require some patience. The devs update the game a lot, but they are very slow when it comes to balancing the game. This is most prominent in modes other than the standard playmode. The wild format hasn't been balanced in months, with one strategy dominating the mode for over a year. The new battlegrounds playmode doesn't get much balancing often either. If you want to have fun, this game is good, but you will need to be patient to play competitively"", ""I've been playing HS since the first launch of the game. But lately the game keep updating something without any prompt, and apparently it disconnect the game, when i reconnect, i was considered lost to my last game. Happened so many times, and it's so frustrating (especially when doing Arena runs). Graphics glitches and game freeze many times since the last expansion update. One more thing, why it took so long to start the game? Is there nothing you can do to make it connect and load faster?"", 'Why is the galaxy note pen bug still a thing, 4 months after the patch that generated the issue?! I feel like there is 0 attention given to this. You acknowledged it only after a month since it started, on your forum; then in the only oficial update you gave you were stating that you guys reproduced it (like it was some realization, i mean just run the game on a galaxy note and try dragging a card), that it looks like an engine issue that takes a lot of time to fix, and that you investigate.', ""When moving from area with WiFi to 4g signal, the app has to close and reopen. Sometimes it doesn't register you've a game in progress until you hit 'play' and then resets again. By the time you make it back into game you've missed 1 or 2 turns making it pointless to continue. Otherwise, loving the new game mode."", 'I have been playing this game for many years now. As of this post, hearthstone is in one of the best places it has ever been. There are many modes to play and some that require zero collections. Conisder playing this game, it is by far the best card game on the store. It is not pay to win. Does it take time to build a good deck if you are F2P, it does but it not hard. I know numerous F2P players who have multiple viable decks.', 'This is by far the best rating on any game I have ever getting on a review. Blizzard\'s ""Hearthstone"" gets 5 Stars across the board for all the right reasons! The gameplay is fun and engaging, multiple heroes are very fairly balanced as well as the corresponding cards for each hero. Two says this game is pay-to-play would be unfair oh, of course like any other TCGit\'s going to cost money to buy booster packs, however I\'ve never purchased a booster and am a formidable opponent if I say so myself!', 'Like other reviews have said, the game hangs on the loading screen for awhile. Seems like they could spread that out a bit by not loading as much as soon as you start the game. Also, making it so that you can leave the app and come back without reopening the whole thing would be great.', ""I started playing this game since Whisper Of The Old Gods expansion which was in 2016 until now. This is the only mobile game that lasted for many years in my phone app. The down side is that Blizzard is a money hungry company which I notice how their expansion and card set became too expensive as the year goes by. They became too greedy with their sales. I used to buy cards before when it was in a good reasonable price. Now it's just ridiculously expensive."", ""I highly recommend this game, its my favourite card and that says alot, since i have play over 100 card games. Its simple, easy to learn great for beginners and new to card games. There is a new card set every 4 months and old sets rotate out every year, in standard there are 7 cards sets for 9 different classes and a basic set of cards everyone gets for free, earning in game money isn't to hard, of course you can choose to buy packs but its not necessary to play the game."", ""Tough to get started when you have basic cards and everyone has stacked decks with legendary everything but it's quite gracious with the amount of card packs it gives you early on. Also the crafting mechanic allows you to get some of the stronger cards without having rng in the way. Matchmaking is rough early on so 3 stars until noobs get matched with noobs"", 'Takes about a full year (maybe two) of playing daily (or every other day) before it really begins to feel like a ""free to play"" game. If you strategize over months, you can get a decent selection of cards to work with for free. Sometimes you trick people into letting you win but usually not. The solo adventures are pretty great. Highly addictive and extremely time consuming. Fun game!', ""Been playing since 2014 (basically since launch), and the continuous expansions and updates always keep the game feeling new. I was new to Blizzard games and didn't know about WoW characters or lore, but then I began playing WoW because Hearthstone made it so interesting. The port on mobile and tablets is also one of the best ports ever for a PC game. The only problem I have is there should be more hero portraits, Magni, Medivh and other heroes should come back to the store."", ""Overall this is a 5 star game, one of the best on mobile, but players are allowed to have strong and cheap decks from the start. These decks aren't those combo styled decks but just super agressive decks that most can't deal with. I just hope that the developers can ever so slightly improve the meta. This is supposed to be a strategic card game, not some no brainer agressive play style. Yes, its use of in game mechanic but it's extremely unskilled"", 'Pros: lots of modes, lots of cards, single and multiplayer modes,ladder system for some modes, warcraft themed Cons: the new player experience could be better, bad reward system. The overall cost of the game is high., no card trading. Some modes are to punishing to new players.', ""Love the game but... During solo play, I usually have no trouble reconnecting to games once the app has closed however it won't ever reconnect to boss fights, sometimes these fights can take 30 minutes or more to finish and I have to do them all in one go or it resets me back to the start of the battle, absolute nightmare for heroic mode"", ""New players must dump money into card pack to be able to compete. Card sets expire as new sets release meaning the grind never ends without real improvement. Other modes exist but 90% the same thing with slight changes, some locked behind paywalls also locking card sets out. One game mode is only worth playing until you win the free pack (which is a classic pack, you'll eventually just have all those cards and the pack is worthless) and one mode is an extremely poorly optimized beta."", ""Fantastic game that will keep you entettained for years. There's plenty of different game modes and characters/cards to suit your style of play. It rewards you for doing a good job and trying everyday with different quests. People complain that it costs money to play which sure thats a bummer but what great games are free?"", ""The AI cheats in solo play. I'm just a starting player but even on the easy challenges the AI is way too tough to beat. It's assumed that a good AI in the computer already can create perfect card ratios in the deck, will have better cards initially, and will calculate the best time to play any of those cards. But that is somehow not enough. The AI in addition will have many more copies than two of a cards, it will have more cards in their deck and more life. What the hell. This game is garbage."", ""I love this game but its super slow. The developers seem to have tried to update it so much and cram so much content in that it just takes an absolute age to load. It's almost unplayable. Sometimes i'll try to load it and give up after 5 minutes of waiting and play something else. It's such a shame because it's such a great game otherwise"", ""I'll be honest, I only started playing a few days ago. The only reason I'm even playing this game is because Gwent The Witcher Card Game has not been released on Android which I think is stupid because it's been on stupid iOS for months now. Anyway I don't like Blizzard Entertainment but I really wanted a CCG and not an Anime one so this is it till Gwent is finally released. I have Hearthstone on my iMac and, when I play this game I prefer the actual computer version."", 'The game was great but now they are doing just like Warcraft 3 Reforged. They put out a garbage expansion, which was just a money grab and completely unbalanced the game, so that you\'d have to pay for more cards to switch from the last ""best class"" which is now trash. Blizzard is just going downhill.', ""Great game, but buggy app. It's pretty frustrating that I have to constantly deal with the app freezing, crashing, and repeatedly disconnecting from the server. There is no excuse for this from a company that can definitely afford to fix it."", ""This app has so many problems. Aside from the obnoxiously long start up and reconnection times (assuming you are even able to reconnect to your game) it will also randomly disconnect you and/or black screen. Don't waste your money on arena. If you want to play this game do so on a pc."", 'Please for the love of god, fix optimization for android devices on Battlegrounds. It runs incredibly slow and laggy while every other game mode runs absolutely fine. The timer in the tavern is never consistent and every action is slow. Also, why does the desktop client get resolution and other graphic options to make the client run faster but android gets no such thing? Once again a Blizzard game falls flat cause of no simple quality of life changes. Other than this, good, addictive gameplay.', ""Easy to pick up and play compared to other card games but still very challenging. You don't need to have the latest cards to do well. Most of the cards are self-explanatory although you would have to research actions like inspire, rush, invoke, etc. It has recently improved alot. Newcomers to the genre will find it more enjoyable than the more complicated card games out there. Blizzard keeps it fresh with extra modes modes and campaigns to help keep it from being stale."", ""So many years Hearthstone cannot fix random crashes on Android phones especially on lower ranks. It requires relaunching all the time and reasons to crash could be anything, but network and memory are fine on my phone. This goes on for many months and occurs really often. Honestly, should be a shame it's not fixed yet."", ""One of the very few online games with a feelgood friendly atmosphere. I don't like that winning involves suffering probably to remind me that i dont pay-to-win and i also dont like that drama feels orchestrated (supposed to be cards drawn in random order but instead its cards in drama order) but i guess todays kids get bored when its otherwise. Anyways bravo and highly reccomended!"", 'I love the game, ive been playing it for a whyle and spent a lot of time in it but it frustrates me that after the last update i cant play it, the game ocasionally crashes every 1-3 minutes and leaves me unable to play anything, cant even create new decks cus i dont have enough t8me to save it before the game crashes, pls fix this blizzard, i tryed every posible way u recommended in help service', ""Very good game, recommend avoiding the battlegrounds mode on mobile phone since it's a very intense game for my device. But I been enjoying myself playing on multiple devices and love the highlander Shaman deck I been playing both in the standard and wild formats. Only complaint is that I'd wish crafting legendary cards were easier."", ""Definitely pay to win. For my first 3 years playing, I lived in casual and NEVER played ranked. If you are a beginner and f2p, you will never win ranked/get higher than rank 20. This is not an exaggeration. You will spend multiple years trying to save up coins/dust & never being able to use the good decks. I spent years stuck at rank 20 bc I didn't want to spend money, and 6 years later I finally give in and immediately get rank 11. Battlegrounds & Solo Adventure is finally making up for it tho"", ""Was a great game but now just crashes constantly before the load screen on a Lenovo yoga. Some sort of Java. Lang. Unsatisfiedlinkerror. Could be something related to processor. Be forewarned if your going to spend money and then can't access the game"", 'Really now, just when i thought they were being cool for giving us 100 gold 100 dust missions...they got greedy again and had to update and reduce the missions I ALREADY HAD by 40 each. All i do all day is get dominated by copycat ptw decks while desperatly grinding missions for my meager pittence so i can unlock another story mission, taking a week or more to get there. Real not really fun anymore. Thank god i never spent a dime on this trash.', ""Hearthstone's devs are greedy and they show no mercy towards newcomers. The only way to be f2p is if you started playing near the start. I would recommend checking out shadowverse if you aren't willing to spend money. The only way to win is by making a single meta deck with all of your dust and taking that to latter. The only downside is it gets boring to play the same decks over and over and over again."", ""Blizzard is bad at balancing Hearthstone's meta, in-game currency, and public relations. The first can be difficult to ask of any ccg creator, but Blizzard really does not like making changes to an online digital format where that would be only place to be able to do that regularly to a ccg. They have been trying lately, but have gotten very greedy with promotions. Honestly expect Hearthstone 2.0 from Blizzard this year or next year to invalidate this game. Do not invest into this game."", 'i think the app is good handles well great game. but when i play on pc when i go to launch it. it never launches. i dont know if this is a bug please fix it i enjoy your games blizzard but i will enjoy it more if you fixed this. plz fix and thank you.', ""After all these years y'all still haven't figured out how to match opponents worth a damn. A new player vs someone who has unlocked every card doesn't make me want to keep playing. Why would you not match based on level. Complete waste of space."", ""Very frustrated.. i can't log in to the game. It keep saying my session expired. What does that even mean? Even after downloading it again , still the BS. If i still can't play it in a few days. Im gonna quit all blizzard game for good .."", ""Server connectivity at an all time low, just now been trying to connect to a solo game with wifi and data for 47 minutes. App keeps rebooting. It's like that all the time though!""]"

The Story

King Arthur had long been revered as Britain's champion, providing the fair land full of life, wealth and peace. Knights and Druids alike found serenity with one another. Jealous of Arthur's adoration from all, the evil Queen Morgana vied to destroy everything the King protected. Upon discovering a dark relic, Morgana and the Black Knight invaded Britain, casting a spell and consuming all life before them.

The great Merlin tells a story of a hero in search of the Holy Grail - Britain's only hope. For Britain to be what it once was, a call to arms is desperately needed. King Arthur has summoned all Knights and Druid allies on a quest for a hero to rise. But who can avenge Britain and find the Holy Grail?

▶Optimization for deck building.
▶Optimization for Deathmatch arena.
▶Optimization for speed-up in battle.","[""I origonally started playing this game a few years back, made an account and had gotten really far into the story and had an amazing team and a group of friends. One day i got in again and found out my account was gone. I tried requesting costumer support but to no vail. I stopped playing the game after a week of me being unable to get my account back. Now im gonna give this game one more try as i remember loving it deeply when i was younger. Don't disappoint me."", ""I played to level 30ish, all the way through Tintagel, even spent a little money for gems, and then 'logged in' for the first. (Error code prevented me from doing it before.) Lost. Everything. Screw this game. Don't waste your time. Try something like Fate Grand Order instead. At least there you can advance in a reasonable way, your stuff is recoverable, and they have a couple of Arthurian Heroes."", ""I used to play this game when it first came out and I decided to replay it. I logged in with my email but dont remember my password and I'm trying to reset it but it pops up behind the login stuff and I cant reset my password. Please dont ask me for my account name and I'd because like I said I havent played the game in a long time just fix it so I can reset my password."", ""Learning to mix and match the groups of team cards, is being a challenge. but well worth the game play. Since my last rating, I have joined a guild, faught several battles, and I have won gem's and other great items."", ""I really like this game but I can't access my account after getting a new phone and when I try to change password it still doesn't let me access my account and I can't contact any support lines"", ""Every time I get a new phone (6 times a year at least) I always download this game it's fun and very immersive, the only game I have yet to get bored with and yes this is a real review if ur thinking that its not"", 'This game barely functions, the ""campaign"" is a blatant mana and stamina drain just so you will buy more when you run out, especially since the percentage of progress you get from taking a step is drastically lower than the stamina the game takes ,the game is pay to win, just keep throwing money at the shop and youll eventually have the best cards in the game. EXP also stopped counting for me and wont go up any further im at level 67(2,329 EXP).This game is over monetised and fails to justify it', '# game developers publish a calendar at the the start of month describing dates of events which they rarely follow # and when event starts it is buggy which they solve after half the event is over and if players ask for compensation tgey simply blame players for loss.', 'This is a really simple game and fun to play.', 'Fun and all but really needs to rebalance older cards to bring them in line with the current game. Most older 7 stars cant hold a candle to any of the newer ones in base stats, skills, or combos.', ""Could you please fix the ascend card features, in my app it doesn't work, Because i enjoyed a lot your app thanks, if you treat and fix that well, you own my 5 🌟 stars Hey, it's worked thanks for repaired"", 'played it in the past and it is even better now great game all around !!!!!!', 'Bought a monthly sub and then it kicked me out of my account, now I have nothing and am on a guest account. Devs wont respond to emailed requesting help accessing account. Avoid', ""If I could give a 2.5 rating I would I'm a returning player, been playing for a while now. But now the game is a former shell of its former glory and here are my points of interests: Honestly, I can write a whole essay on this 1- To me, the game has lost its challenge. 2- The new cards just make the old ones redundant + the art has taken a downgrade. 3-Too much focus on just 7*cards 4-Little engagement with the community 5- Servers are now just filled with bots 6-No way to recover a lost account"", ""I cant login to my id... keyboard missing, it didn't pop out .. my id already complete 34 achievement out of 37... solve this, i edit this start rating"", ""Can't create an account and the developers can't fix the problem"", 'Great card collection game!', ""Havent been able to log in with my Kabam id at all, even after changing the password. Lost all my progress. Not worth playing if it's this janky."", 'Want all card r free. Change all city bosses.', ""I'm really enjoying this game, the graphics are good, gameplay is simple and fun and it's really laid back, but the thing I love most is that the developers actually got history fairly accurate (aside from the weapons but that's fine by me) it warms my heart to see us Welsh having our history told properly and not having the English taking credit for it for once. The army King Arthur defeated was the English invasion and it's nice to see the Devs honouring Wales and not England with this story."", ""Its a pretty good ccg, p2w aspect is pretty small if you have time to gather stuff. Art is AMAZING, like seriously, that's part of the reason I keep redownloading it. But... There is one problem. This game eats up storage like crazy. When you down load it, it starts at 1+ GB, and then it starts to fill up all theremaining space. I had to delete it when it hit 3+GB, game is like that one child who don't want to have more siblings."", ""Spent money on this game, then tried accessing my account on a different phone. My google account was still intact but can't log in. Tried to ask for help but they said my account is lost forever. Bye"", ""good game. but like many other games , only those who spend and keep spending get to the top. never even a single thought for those who can't afford to pay, money can't buy you gaming skill but gaming skill only goes so far. where's the sportmanship? like giving one a musket and the other buys himself a m16 rifle fith juggernaut armor. you don't need a phd to figure out who'd win. i will not feed this greed by playing this game."", 'To easy to use up mana potions since it does not roll over the unused portions when you use a new one, and it takes 1 potion for each boss encounter. Kinda really sucks. And it would be nice if their was a bit more explanation about functions and items. Other than that, I really like the game.', ""Everything is great but do increase the card drop rate of bosses. Even the gold amount in the quest. Introduce with new events as it gets boring for the time being to do the long queat, if possible add auto quest option! I love the graphics though! new events doesn't pop up on my quests!"", ""I really love this game it was super fun and all.The only reason it's a 3 star is because I use to have a lvl 90 sss deck character and my account got deleted some how,but I'm happy because I don't have to go thought as much stress trying to get to s even,I can get there in like 45 minutes"", ""After updated this game to version 9.1 now it has a bug. I can't skip level 10 in dragon fight. It shows a fatal error and game freeze. Plz fix it and also provides some guidelines or hint that a 7 star card drops which different cards shards on sacrifice. It is very difficult to find your favorite card shards on sacrifice. For example i can't find King midas shards and don't know which card is needed for sacrifice. Plz help me"", 'Game is fine. Just dont waste your time on lucky spins. They are rigged. Spent 3000 gems on it and won 5 out of 200 spins', 'I need help recovering my account been a long time fan but keep having to restart🙏', 'I used to love this game, but im level 50 and can\'t do much because I dont have the newest cards, any of these ""special"" tokens, and I run out of mana/stamina after literally five minutes of play. Not wasting more money on this.', 'try to log into my account and it wont let me reset my password and or get help to fix the problem. 1 star sounds good for a constant problem. update sent an email to them and no response. would give less than 1 star if I could.', 'I love this game sometimes its hard getting cards but theres something always going on', ""would rate it higher. have played this game for years and love it the4e is no other game like it. however now there's a glitch where you are unable to upgrade cards they simply glitch glitchy to the deck and this occurs with all cards. fix it and I'll for sure give 5 stars."", ""Can't pull up keyboard to login, can't sync via FB either. Was gonna play again. Oh well"", 'It was challenging until exp gain was too low n mana consumption was too high', 'Played for 2 weeks and made great progress. All of a sudden when i log in theres a problem and i have to sign into my game account. Never made a game account so im out 13 bucks and 2 weeks of my time. Garbage.', ""Bad Management. I lost my account, money and time. I recomment creating a account, I don't really know how to do that, so you'll have to find out how. If you link it to your google account and make changes you'll have to login and re-sync. The have no valid email or customer support. Good luck!"", ""I've played this game for a while in the past, and I re downloaded it. I love this game still, I just enjoy that there is always room for improvement. I just wish I had more mana without having to reduce my mana."", ""Only 3* because game takes up to much storage space, and does't allow me to transfer this over to SD card which has tonnes more storage space and lastly why is't this on console yet!?"", 'Its ok but i think you should bring out summons that players can obtain tickets for in the arena. It would bring a decent amount of traction as well as keep veteran players happy.']"
