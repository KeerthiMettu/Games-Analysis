Thanks for playing and as always, happy terraforming!","['Truly enjoyable. Well organized. No adverts unless you want them and plenty of rewards for watching. The only difficulty so far is occasional delays: I tap the screen and then see one of those important choice pop-ups come and go. Not a huge deal in the long run, I guess. I may give it five stars once I know what happens after completing Mars. I agree with others that the tutorial is horrible, way too long. I would prefer to explore the buttons myself and receive explanation as I go along.', ""This game is spectacular. It has everything that I want: Simulation; simple guidelines; easy to obtain goals; and lack of conflict. I have checked out other games with similar ideas, but I don't wish to fight wars or have to deal with conflicts fighting enemies. That kind of thing makes me nervous & unhappy. The goals that you need to reach sometimes require that you sacrifice a Genesis Point or 2 but if you take your time, you don't have to spend extra (real) money on anything, just wait & then you can get what you need. My fear is that I'll make progress and the game will crash & all my progress will be lost, as I've read some people experience with games like these. I also admit to pausing the game for a long while and then I forgot how to unpause it, but once I got it going again, it was wonderful. I wish that there was a PC version of this that was even more in-depth so that I could develop my culture & terraforming even more. I love stuff like this. I love to build, develop, design, & watch what I've created grow. I am a God-complex gamer. I just want to play God & be in control of everything. So much fun! I love TerraGenesis!"", ""Very happy with the experience. Much fun to be had. I'm on my 3rd planet and learning new strategies with each. Definitely not impossible to complete without spending any real money like some have said. Keep the tips they give you in mind, and you won't have to put any money you dont want to, into it. I guarantee you that you wouldn't mind spending on it though. Would be totally worth it to up the experience. I will probably buy the expansion planets at some point."", ""This game has been an enjoyable, slow paced world building adventure. Mostly text based, you can watch the planet gradually change as you terraform and expand. Its exciting when you see oceans form for the first time, forests grow, cities grow, and transit lines connect those cities. The calming music complements the whole experience. I'll probably never delete this game, incan see myself coming back to it again and again."", ""It is a great game. Lots of different things to look out for and make sure they are on the right track. The music in the background is perfect for the type of game and us very relaxing. It is easy to play once you have got the hang of where everything is. I think it has become my favourite mobile game. I'm not sure if I just havnt found it but it would be nice to be able to see what you cities look like up close instead of just from orbit but that's the only negative I can think of."", ""this game is pretty fun with simple gameplay that sucks you in. My favorite part, though, is the app has ads but they're only for rewards in-game rather than randomly interrupting gameplay. great job, developer. I'm far more likely to support ads this way as the other style, which makes me not want to even play the game."", ""So far after about a week it's been a Good game, bit of a steep learning curve not toilet the planet boil or flood but fun all the same. Today had my first problem after having a planrt that's pretty stable when you log in you are able to quadruple the credits in exchange for genesis points. Over night my planet accrued 35 million credits so I took the offer unknown to me was I only had 1 point so I backed up into the game to find all 35 million credits had gone."", ""So I just beat Mars - made a bunch of mistakes originally so I am sure it took longer than normal, but it was still a blast! I didn't need more GP (in game currency) but I wanted to support the devs so I bought a small pack. Again, if you have patience (ie if you've ever played Sim City without going insane...) you really don't need to buy anything. They give you free currency for watching videos, and even that, you really don't need to spend. I am currently working on Mercury. Much harder (upped the difficulty as well), which is more rewarding. I'm still definitely still a solid booster for this game, in this genre!"", ""The visuals are incredible and the govenors are a welcome addition. I can't see the cities from orbit but I honestly don't care about that, the rest of the game more than makes up for it. Just a couple of suggestions, can you make the O2 condense out of the atmosphere at 90.18K and freeze at 54.36K? Could you make the magnetic feild part of the game? You guys are the best."", ""Honestly, very relaxing & enjoyable for me. Patience is a virtue. Mars was completely free to play, as we're a few others but I chose to spend a couple $'s to get the Trapper-1 scenario. Ads are actually very welcomed but not necessarily needed to play. They give you boosts of 200% resources or genesis points to spend. So much fun!! Thank you Devs! Love the addition of the governor's to help your cities. I'm looking forward to future updates."", 'Love that there is also a podcast. Started a game on each free planet and the moon but find it more annoying than enjoyable, not unlocked the bio sections yet though. Governers and party charactera seem underused. I love games like Democracy 3 and simpler games like Cells (to singularity), but this fails to capture me. Better ways to view the planet would help my little city always pings off into the distance and I would love to have more culture events and perhaps see more characters speaking', ""Enjoyable! The game is pretty straight forward and you can get by without needing to do micro transactions at all. Once you figure out how to manage your colony, you can always be making money. There are plenty of opportunities to get free in game currency where if you don't want to spend real money, you don't have to."", ""Excellent game esp the pause function because there's serious micro managing. If you like strategy and civilisation development games give it a go! Pretty intellectual too I liked the scientific aspect of it! Great work really enjoyed, maybe easier scrolling through what buildings city has or a summary page of buildings and how many you have would be easier again."", 'The game is really solid. For the most part it is waiting however it is really interesting to see the progression of your planet. The only thing I dislike is when it says ""incoming transmission"" and if you tap it it asks if you want to watch an ad for a one hour boost. There are no forced ads in this game, but I feel that if they sent the transmission less often, more people would watch the ads.', ""This game is interesting. The in-app purchases are not necessary to play it, and there are several ways of getting the benefits of the currency w/o real $. Its mechanics are introduced gradually so it doesn't overwhelm you with too much at once. It also has a few levels of difficulty you can pick from if you have trouble balancing your terraforming efforts. It is pretty, and doesn't require you to spend a lot of time playing. And best of all, you can pause the planet so it doesn't go in backgrnd"", ""I've been playing this for more than a whole year now. It's a very good game, can give you something to think about every now and then. Sometimes can be a little linear, though, once you finish a world, the next one is the same steps. New addition of the governers is really cool detail."", 'Yet another mobile game that fails to deliver. Be prepared to spend more time watching ads than playing the game if you want to make any sort of progress. Tutorial is rushed, terrorists will blow up your buildings (wiping out half your fledgling population in the process), incredibly slow game progression, no visual changes to the planet as you develop either, despite the advertising. Incredibly disappointing. Another example of a developer caring more about ad revenue than an enjoyable game.', 'Really like this game, the bad part is that I am stuck in the screen that asks me to agree with their Privacy Policy and I cant click out of that. Emailed support but no response yet. Cleared cache. Afraid to clear data, however my planet must have died already. Is it a bug? Please fix it. Thanks much', 'It just seems like you have to be CONSTANTLY checking it. During the day, my planet would be in perfect shape. At night while I was sleeping, it would always become i habitable. You shouldnt have to lose sleep over a game and have to start all over in the morning. Good graphics tho', ""Absolutely LOVE this game. The statistical management, having an objective to work toward and seeing the result, and best of all, MICROTRANSACTIONS ARE OPTIONAL! Yea you have to sit through ads if you want to progress quicker but even that is optional. Its worth it while you wait on construction and research. Otherwise it's an idol game"", ""This is a really fun passive game. So far I've only terraformed Mars. You can take it slow or watch ads and get rewards to quickly boost your planet towards whatever your end goal is. I check in with it several times a day and it's neat to see the planet change and grow."", ""It's a good game, but late game gets grindy with the waiting and the balancing, and the constant need of money, I wish there was a tax of some sort with the cities so if your mines deplete, you won't start massively start losing money, and then lose all your money before you can fix it"", 'COMPELLING premise. FUN for those who like Space themes & play@yourOwnPace simulations. Resource demanding. Lockups after info pops FIXED last update (THANKS!). Coerces using GooglePlay; & Facebook for backup. Necessary data could be saved on device alone; backup ""services"" should be unnecessary. Benefits others with YOUR data while CREATING risk for user. It once CAUSED me to lose ALL my accomplishments irrecoverably. Had been/am intentionally only saving data on device', ""üíØ It's a really great game but very time consuming. OMG, it's like a week long simulation per planet. Once you stabilize the atmosphere & currency & the population growth, you can just turn off the game and just let it grow and that can take days, which all you can literally do is wait. And that is not even mentioning the research and construction time durring the first 30+ hours of game play. Definitely play multiple planets at once. Love it!\U0001f6f8üòúüññ"", 'So much more than most games. For me its pretty addicting. You have to continually chek in and watch your stats and make adjustments if want your people to survive. Very real in that respect. However since the anniversary message i have been having problems with it hanging up and will not clear all the messages. Gets stuck on a message and will not respond sending my planets into chaos and killing everything off 2nd time this has happened and im stuck', ""Game was super fun, but after spending about $20 to get all my stuff balanced my facilities started to randomly disappear AGAIN. I don't have anything left to fix said facilities disappearing and it was about to actually kill all the work I put in. Done with this app. Dont waste your time or money on it, they'll only screw you over completely. Would love to get back the money I wasted on this game."", 'I like space games and this one captures the imagination, and has a decent degree of scientific basis. Lacks replay value however, as once youve created a stable biome there isnt anything to do except see how high the population gets. Also cant handle logging in on multiple devices, the game will update to whichever was open last. I lost an whole day on my planet because i didnt close it on one device while playing on another.', ""The game is great, there is absolutely no doubt about but it definitely needs some improvements such as more detailed view of your planet and your cities. And additionally it would be wonderful to have common solar system shared with other players and see their planets current states. The game is great but there's so much room to make it even greater"", ""It's a very interesting little game, very different to what I've come across so far but enjoyable if you like Kerbal Space Program or Plague Inc. Requires forethought and adverts aren't in your face like other games. Bit of a slow burner so if you're impatient then probably not for you."", 'This is probably the worst game (of its kind) I played. To begin with the gameplay lacks simple gaming intelligence to warn you about upcoming events/disasters that might destroy your entire progress (aka the time you spent on the game) in a couple of hours. On top of it, you never get your promised game credits for 3rd party marketing campaigns and you don‚Äôt get a single response from customer support when you contact the. Waste of time.', ""It's A VERY FUN Game!!! I LOVE IT!! I Definitely recommend this to others players who also HAVE this Type of Interest & Taste in Games. I really hope it develops and Upgrades One Day to Playstion or Xbox consoles. I would love to play this game with even more Incredible Content, Advanced Options, and Better Features!!!"", ""It's not a freemium type game! It's seems slow and involved, but you quickly realize that minor adjustments make all the difference in success. I'm only on Mars, but it seems as if there are more planets to unlock. It's a great game if you are into the idea of geofarming new planets!"", ""2 days into the game nothings happened. that's when I noticed the game itself is purchase able content for different simulations. this just turned me off right away i thought I would get to try the whole game out for free and if I wanted to speed things up I could indulge. on too the next terraformer/miner/planetary exploration game!"", ""Ok game, but you're forced to watch loads of ads, play other crappy games, and watch ads inside of these crappy games to get coins to move further in this game. I don't think you can really loose in this game, purely a revenue raiser. And a huge waste of time."", 'In my opinion, the tutorial did more damage than help. It forced me to spend in-game currency and make decisions that I ended up spending more in-game currency to reverse or tweak to the way I wanted it. By the end of tutorial and tweaking everything. I basically just lost interest.', 'So...I spend three hours playing this ...I exit out...go back in..and instead of seeing the game I wasted three hours on, I get a full list...of other planets...you have to buy..mine is nowere to be found..great game though..but seriously..what the hell? I have never been so pissed at game this bad before ..', ""Good game but when I had acquired gp point through the in game rewards for achievements in other games the game suggested I tried, the gp points were removed and dropped to 0 after a notification from developer that I should buy the gp with real currency. If a player can't use your in game rewards scheme then please remove it. Very unhappy as this is a good game."", 'It is a fun terriforming game that gets more complex with each planet. I love watching the image of the planet change as you go along and find myself obsessively checking the meters to make sure everything is moving in the right direction. I also like that the ads are optional!', ""This is the very first terraforming game i've played and i have to say, it's pretty good. The only thing that i don't like is once the planet reaches habitability, it doesn't sustain itself. And/or the fact they dont have something to regulate the planet overall. But great game, love the science behind it."", 'I would give 5 stars, as it is great game, but when your planet develop and you have more than 5 cities and population over 20.000.000 game lags and it takes all of the pleasure. I play on samsung galaxy s8, which is not that old and should easily be enough to run that kind of a game without constant lags.']"

My only thing is coins can only be used to speed things up not give permanent bonuses so they are looking for people to keep spending money late game or mid game just to speed up long upgrade times, I'd say that isn't a good business model but then again I don't think greed is good either. I understand you have to make money and everything but yeah overall good game but please fix upda"", ""Still one of the best games in the market. it's not pay2win. Recent update brought many changes. Some of them are good but I still don't like the new energy like idea of building and recruiting citizens because it's impossible to play in long sessions without throwing money.

I come no where close to filling the cooldown for building more buildings. Other than that everything is great and the update is awesome.', ""I love this game! Super polished and has had some great improvements! BUT, the Engrish is pretty bad; most text descriptions are awful and a few make no sense whatsoever so much that I cant tell what they do.

Am I missing something?"", ""It's a fun game but the only things I noticed is it takes way to long for some building's to develop, some of the best building's require gold and that's hard to come bye, & all people do is walk around (would be cool to see them entering in and out of homes and building's. Also wish there was like an auto pick for when your gone to snag up the money and crowns... but maybe I'm being to picky... good game tho"", 'Fun game, not much p2w witch is good, you can login when you want and the stuff will be there... building should have like a storage, for example, if a building produces 10k coins in 30 min, it could have a storage of 40k coins, so after 2 h would be full.

I gave four stars because I don\'t get the point of having these different races and towns if they never interact with each other. Lots of cool buildings. If I could make a suggestion; it would be real cool if the habitants on Shipwreck Cove could move from land to water. It would be grat to see them walk from land to sea. Other than that it\'s a pretty cool game. However it needs to be a little more ""poor"" friendly if you know what I mean. Give more gold', ""I really like this game. I'm playing on a Tab tablet and no glitches at all."", 'As I\'m not paid to have a good opinion, I\'ll be honest. The last time I paid 50 bucks for a game was when they were sold on cartridges, and those were inherently expensive. Now we\'re being sold ""in game perks"" for games of the same quality for $100.00 +. On platforms that dont have huge overhead costs. Hence my not so pleasant opinion of these money-grab ""mobile"" games.', ""I have always enjoyed Sparkling Society games but this has to be my favorite....it has even surpassed my love for City 4! It's easy and a novel idea. I play it on my tablet and have no problem with it ever. It might not be for those who have to go a thousand miles per second to be happy....but it's just perfect for me."", ""This game seems really cool, kind of game I would play for hours. Nice graphics, interface is easy. However, it takes a while to load. I'm ok with that but very laggy, makes it almost unplayable. Other gams like this run fine on my tablet. Also there seems to be no real story line other than just to buid. Maybe because I didn't play it enough. I hope updates make it playable. Want to give better stars will check back soon. RCA Viking Pro 10 standard distro."", 'Such a Great Game I Love it ! Only downfall! we started with loads of Gold N Coins, Gold is hard to build it back up, Frustrating as houses change from money to gold, after adding them, U cant buy for workers houses, when this happens. It would be great if we could watch a video to earn more gold 2 buy houses 4 workers 2 make gold so game runs smoother . Such a relaxing game after busy day! If you Love Fantasy Game of Elfs N Dwarfs this is a Winner ! My favorite game so far thanks XXX', ""Engaging game with adorable graphics. The reward/game play ratio is good. I do wish there was more opportunity to earn gems. Pricing is fair if you decide to spend rl money instead of waiting to receive free. I've been playing for over a week, have 4 islands I'm developing and have had no issues or glitches. Thanks for the quality fun!"", ""Only gripe. The bars on the upper right hand corner for Citizens and jobs in balance are not functioning properly they don't properly fill up.

Your games are STELLAR!!!"", ""All ok but only 4 stars as wrecking ball doesn't seem to demolish rocks and logs that are in way, just wanted to put up a house or bussiness & find out I can't due to a rock or a log in the way :-( 5 stars if this problem could be fixed, thank you :-)"", 'So far its been great experince with this game. However the furtune wheel is not active keeps saying comming soon and i have almost 600 tokens waiting to be used so i really would like you guys and gals to get that running . I do think that your asking way to much in game coins for builds like 1millon plus for buildings and then we have to wait like 3 or 4 hrs for it to be built. I dont like that to much but all and all its not a bad game. fix the wheel = five stars. thanks Celestial', ""I enjoy playing Fastasy Forge: World of Empires! It's a great 5 star game. I love collecting those coins for in game profit! I am a coin collecter in real life. I lost some of my coins when I moved, but still have a few of the coins left. They are nonvalued, they can't be spent anymore."", ""Pretty fun , but can't log in to be on the leader board."", 'Game gets boring as building takes hours. An enormous amounts needed. All you do is uild and upgrade. No fun', ""Loving the game so far totally different from anything I've been playing, loving the concept."", 'If your a Casual gamer looking to build cities of Fantasy such as dwarfs, Elfs etc. This is the game for you. Smooth easy and the rewards are very well ballanced. The graphics are good and the music lifts your spirits. So honestly why are you still reading this? Download and play!!!', 'So far this is a pretty good game! Unlike some other city builders, you can build what you want, where you want it. The graphics are really nice. I like that after developing a city you can move to another location with different buildings.', 'The game is fantastic and the graphics are superb. I love the game. Can we have another game called Christmas island. You have done a good job keep up the good work. I would recommend everyone to try this game you will love it and you never get bored as these is so much to do.', 'Fun game so far. Only issue is i started with a nice sum of gold. Used a good chunk to unlock the pirate area. To only see i cant do jack in that area. Kinda annoying to drop 500k and not get any use out of it. But when i can guess it will pay off.', 'Good game to pass time, one issue I face is that if I go offline once and play the game I have to manually set it to backup the next time I go online, it should be automatic in my opinion.', 'I just started playing & like it so far. I am telling others about it & lots more may be coming to play. Theres a game that we play that is shutting down. I decided to find a new game to play & I found this one. I am telling others about it. How good the graphics are & a learning experience.']"

My partner and I both play this. Can't put my phone down for long as it's really addictive."", ""Greasy by name, greasy by nature. I can't complain too much, it's a free game based on a property I love but my word it becomes a grind very quickly"", 'Very addictive game, The ideas behind it is very similar to other games but this has alittle more fun behind it. I would of gave the game 5 stars but I truly believe that the development team are greedy, Due to the events. To be able to get anywhere with an event you need to spend a minimum of $30 and to be able to get in the top 10 you need to spend minimum of $100. This latest event, seems impossible to get cards to level up businesses. Also just to get the guy for the last business is $28 BS', ""Originally I gave the game 5 stars without even playing it but now that im up to season 36 its time for a real review. 1st , the main game dialogue is just based on the t.v. series so if you have watched that, your bored. 2nd, hash coins cost WAY TO MUCH. 50$ for 750 coins gets you about 5,000 whiskey, and whiskey is spent real quick. Reevaluate that please. Last, check your ads, there are a few that you can't mute and it's annoying as hell. Especially the Facebook one, considering I have FB"", ""It's an easy to learn game and pretty friggin radio show I can still get down with the boys when in away from the tube"", ""This game is funny as hell, I enjoy it! It brings stuff that actually happens and goes on in the show into this game, I would definitely recommend people to play it, it's very fun and not only is it a tycoon like game and such, you actually experience some very fun battles against some common and well-known rivals throughout the game as you progress and it's absolutely fantastic and funny! I can't stop laughing at all the references and how Liquor and Hash Coins are a type of currency! 5 STARS!!"", 'Ive been playing this for over a year and the entire time i gave a 5 star rating. But now majority ot the time i get on it says there was an error loading your daily login reload game. It just did that to me 4 times. I would hate to have to uninstall a game ive spent real money with and ive been rocking with for so long. Please fix this. I have full signal and everything.', ""Compared to other idle games, this isn't as bad. It seems to freeze and crash a lot though. Especially during events. But other than that, it hasn't forced me to buy into it to level unlike some games. The promo thing gets kinda annoying though. Happens every time you upgrade a character, or get a new builidng."", 'Great fun for a great show! Really like the customer tracking update today! Thanks team.', 'Great so far I wish somebody would take these type of games and put in an interaction place of some sort...a bar and you can play pool...a park and you can hit on chicks or shoot hoops or play home run derby. Sitting and just watching gets old... however gets it right will have an excellent game ü§ôüíØüçª', ""I only gave one star because there is not a lower option. My tablet was stolen and I didn't realize it for several months. During that time there were multiple purchases made for this game. I reached out for some help getting back any of my money that was the same as stolen. The response I got basically called me a liar and provided no help at all. I definitely will not knowingly spend my money on this or any other app by this developer!"", 'Glad you added the shadow upgrade thing for levels. It is super helpful.', 'Typical freemium game. You need liquor to ""permanently"" upgrade your characters abilities. Liquor is very hard to get and can\'t be acquired idley. You can spend your hard saved liquor to level up characters so that they will auto collect the money from their shop. However, the catch is, that as you progress through the game they will lose their auto collect feature for no reason and need to be leveled again at an increased amount of liquor. The game requires you to spend money to enjoy it.', 'This game is a good time killer and I like the references and costumes.', ""Had to drop a star because you chose to release an update in the middle of an event. Mine just keeps spinning waiting for the download even though I have full bars on my service. Clearing cache did not help. Trying a reinstall. Hopefully I'll still have my progress both in the game and the event. I got back in with the reinstall. I have my stuff but definitely lost progress on the event which I am not happy about. I'll consider 5 stars again if this does not happen again."", ""I have played this game for almost 3 years I am level 61 and on a previous iPhone level 26(couldn't transfer game save) so I have really played it daily for a long time. It has now got to a point where you have to spend money on it. The rewards are terrible when you log on for example I used to be able to level up over the course of about a week. I have been on level 61 for 3 weeks and haven't even been able to complete one task or automate any businesses. Deleted game now. What a waste!!"", 'Very much pay to win. Free hashcoin offers sometimes takes days instead of being instant like most games of these types. It is very frustrating to spend tons of time trying to get rank for items only to be outstripped impossible to catch up on the first day of a 3 day event.', ""Great game. If you're looking for something to do for a few minutes a day it's the best game for that. Events probably you need to spend money, but there are alot of fan pages/resources out there to help you spend your resources correctly. After you reach 150ish hash you can generally make that back over the course of the event, but if you want all the prizes money/hash is a necessity 75% of the time. After a few months you really see alot of progress for a few clicks a day."", 'Good game, could be much better. Has a few minor issues. And the offerwall ""contact support"" is not working. Contacted customer service to report issues and all I got was a rejected email. Also completed offers and got no reward. Reported this WITH PROOF and got another rejected email. Wouldn\'t spend money on this to save my life.', ""Fun, but for the first few seasons, I felt like there was just too much going on. I felt like the tutorial part of this game would never end. Also, I think the game is just too easy. There's not really much of an incentive to keep playing early on, because there's not much of a challenge. Everything else about the game is right on the 'greasy' money, from the general vibe to the dialogue and characters. Lots of little easter eggs for fans to pick up on!"", ""Great game at first but now I can't get ham for the event by watching ads. It was working fine but now it won't load the ads to earn hams. Dropping it down from a 5 star rating to a 3. When the glitches are fixed I'll consider raising it back to 5 stars. But until then all I can do is sit and wait while I collect money and open trunks."", ""This game is so good, it hooked me straight away - do recommend this game... but there is a lot of story in the game and I don't 100% like it but atleast the story is quite interesting anyway, hope this was helpful if you were thinking if it's worth downloading the game, especially for the people who don't entirely like story based games, thank you for your time..."", 'Game is very fun would be cool if they brought in certain aspects from other mobile games since they fit the theme of trailer park boys. Imagine it being like black ops but instead of campaign, zombies and multiplayer you can choose weed trailer (Weed Farm) ,businesses (this game) and maybe a beat em up thing as a third option', ""It's a fun game the but I'm lossing interested in it fast the games inside of the game are not as fun as they was it's taking way to long to get money or like this one broken bottle if you don't put money in to it you don't get anywhere in it I'm sorry give me a reason to put money into the game get me to the edge of get there where I want it more it's just not as fun as it was when every week is the same thing"", 'LMAO I loved the series so it wasn\'t hard to love the game. I can see it possibly getting a little boring and repetitive over time but that\'s just my opinion. Only started playing it today. Well done guys! Edit - still loving it! Has officially been the longest lasting game on my phone. I can hear Ricky saying ""a toe to sow"" right now ü§£', ""Pretty cool game only complaints I have is that sometimes you join an event so late that its impossible to even get into reward ranking. I joined the last event at A and the #1 ranker was at V already.. reduce leaderboards 150. Also you guys need to optimize the framerate. I get an average of 5 frames per second past season 35, lags so bad when dragging I've accidentally purchased stuff. Other than that it's cool, plenty of content. I'll up to 5 stars if you fix issues."", ""Fun to play so far but then I'm a humungous fan of TPB. Really seems to be a pay 2 play. Very long and difficult to make substantial progress unless you pay real cash. Impossible to get any progress unless u watch ads or are willing to pay. ALL about the revenue stream for this developer. Oh and the developer will cheat on how and where you can earn or collect rewards. 2 hours wait time somehow takes 5 hours equal angry players. I won't be downloading Any more games from this company."", 'I think its just plain stupid that i need to upgrade 8 out of 8 people in one season to be able to auto collect. Maybe give more cards and liquor or lower amounts of each needed and it be okay. Just another way to try and get pay and play from free game 1 2 3 DELETE', ""Awesome addition to the show!!! Been playing for 2 years now (on and off). Once was up to Season 69 üòâ but hadn't had it backed up on the cloud and lost the data currently back at Season 32 still playing daily when i can! Absolutley love the game and the stories between Seasons and Side Stories."", ""Been playing for a while now and some days I really get into it, but it does get a lil boring sometimes but as do most games. But overall I enjoy the game. And I'm not going to lie I really only started playing because I love the show and wanted to see how far I could get and as of this moment 12/09/2019 I'm on season 27 so we'll see if I can make it to the end just not sure how long it's going to take, but I'm going to keep playing till I can't take it any longer and try my best to finish it."", 'Not a terrible game but... the worst part of the game is the events as this game has a lot of cheaters, not the way I like to play even though I know cheats are out there and just ruin the gameplay for the rest of us that want fair play. With that said if your reading this and you cheat for self gratification then try to be respectful and stay out of the community events. If not for the cheaters I would give this game a 4 to 4.5 stars for sure.', 'Would b 5 stars and the best game ever but it keeps crashing my tablet when loading the game. Please release a patch to fix and i will fix this review. Nice response but my old ass tablet plays all other games including new call of duty just fine. I play many different games and this is the only one that messed up. So is it the tablet or the game. I would say the game. Anyone who says the tablet is a f****n jacka**. Im 38 bro i have gamed for a long time. I know what im saying ""bud"".', ""I love the game I only have a few complaints... one is it keeps crashing on my ZTE Majesty Pro. And the other is this game isn't on the Amazon Games listings. Only way I can somewhat play this game is offline because online it crashes frequently. Will give five stars when these issues are rectified."", ""I love your game but I ask for help once there are you said was try clearing the catch or uninstalling the game and reinstalling it that does not help I'm having trouble playing the game it keeps telling me I don't have enough storage but I have 32GB of storage but it tells me I have less than 100MB of RAM so the game keeps crashing so please help me figure out what's wrong."", 'Update: Plating the new mini event now and everything is going smooth as normal. I sent an email as suggested through the games help menu and the response times were amazing. Ovbious that the guys over at Eastside games care about their audience. Iv left a few comments before on other games, both critical and positive and never received such a fast and positive response. 5/5 service from a 5/5 game Cheers', ""Holy shoot guy's this game is awesome and there's no ads except for stuff like free 15 liquor and you don't pay to wind without adds this is the best. I love the interactions you get with the funny characters from the original show. You have a cool story line plus fun boss battles. From funny quotes to tons of original business from the show its perfect. Keep the great work up awesome developers."", ""Now level 86, I keep playing and occasionally spend money, but at this point in the game nothing is worth it. The cards and liqor you get for upgrades during events is bs. I spent 300 hash coins to teu to at least place top ten and still no. I only made 180 back in hash coins trying my hardest. It purposefully doesn't let you buy cards you need even if you have liquor. Wish I could get my money back. NOT WORTH THE TIME OR MONEY if you chose to spend."", ""Been playing this game for a little while was on episode 40 with a lot of perks. This recent event it failed to let me in the game. Said it was checking for assets for over 24 hours....had to uninstall and reinstall. Now I have to start all over. Can I please get restored back to where I was at. If not won't be playing this game anymore if the bugs keep up like this. It's bad enough I lost a full days of the current event. Update got the game back and everything is well 5 star for the easy fix.""]"

Plz plz plz fix this then I'll give 5 stars"", ""I like the concept and it starts out fun, but it really needs an overhaul and some rebalancing. Unlike other idle games that become more fun as you go and rack up bonuses and multipliers, this game becomes less fun because each level requires so much more to stay idle.

Very frustrating for this type of game."", ""I really love playing this game. I have played one like this before. I extra love the events.

The cons: It's pay as you play. It's cumbersome to collect energy & it doesn't always accumulate thru time. It tries to force you to buy energy when you are out. I'd much rather buy the game for a flat fee versus the never ending purchases. I'll never buy an in app purchase. Ill play for free until I get bored. Just charge a fee for the game after a trial. You'll have much higher satisfaction."", ""I'd rate this game higher, because I love HOW it plays.. (quest based explorer), but there is a HUGE drawback. As others have noted, you only gain up to 50 energy. There are single trees that take more than that to clear. Without spending lots of cash, it will take a long time to explore even one area. It also takes a long time to build up to the coin to buy new buildings, and of course the building materials that you need other resources to build... and on and on and on with the ways to spend gems, which of course cost cash. I originally downloaded to get credits in another game once I reach a certain level. Because of this structure where it is excruciating frustrating to gain levels and move ahead, I'll be uninstalling as soon as I get to the level I need for my other credits. Kind of sad... it has great potential!"", ""It seems the developer is not open to negative feedbacks, Quite sad. The mentioned source is very limited, we have no control on when the balloon man comes for the video. It's not as simple as you mention.Very boring after few levels. The draw back is the power system. It is not for people who want to play for sometime to unwind.Its Only people who have nothing to do the entire day, it gets drained out in seconds and only if I have lots of real money to spend on games, can u play for longer."", 'Gameplay is nothing like the ads. This game is a boring, poorly made money grab that utilizes false advertising to scam people into downloading. Not worth anyone\'s time. If you want an actual game, there are plenty out there but this is just lazy garbage. After my initial review, the devs replied, ""We appreciate your review! We are currently experimenting with our ads in order to make them more entertaining and diverse. Many thanks for your honest feedback, it helps us to define the right direction!"" The ads don\'t need to be entertaining or diverse, they need to be HONEST! You totally missed the point here!', 'I agree with the other reviews about FALSE ADVERTISING! Not ONE of the puzzles I the ads are actually in the game (like finish the puzzle or match the cards, etc.) The ads are not showing the game from different angles, they are showing things that do not exist! The game is fun for what it is, just be aware that it is not what is advertised.', ""Energy should time build to at least 75 to truly make the game enjoyable. Even with the furnace, the cauldron and the match game, some things are almost impossible to do without using tons and tons of emeralds. With the current energy build level you can only do 2 or 3 things that take energy. Jumping in and out of Klondike so much to build time energy gets very boring. I don't know how much longer I will try to play. Otherwise the game would actually be really fun and very addictive."", ""I have been playing this for 2 years. I really enjoy it and love the challenges. But yesterday I switched phones. And now my game reset me to the very beginning. I have tried everything to find my progress. Can someone please help me. I won't start over after daily playing for 2 years. I was really far into the game and just started the new pearl challenge. Really don't want to uninstall, but will if I can't get my progress back. Still waiting for response on here or e-mail."", ""This game is a blast if you have the money to spend but as everyone else has said, it takes too much energy to progress. The developer keeps saying it's about strategy but in the end it really isn't. I'm sure it IS possible to play without spending money, but not in a way that allows you to continuously play and truly enjoy the game. Possibly offering a monthly program or lowering the prices at the very least would help a lot. I've spent over 250$ and may have to delete the game soon."", 'Ok.. I have played many of these type games. This one is sooo out of balance. The energy spent to progess is ridiculous. You earn 1 energy point for each successful level. The order board... After the first few levels they request only green house poduce. You get 4 plots in each green house. The requests will be high in number. Such as 30 plus. Because of this earning coins is challenging. The shipping requests... A joke. I gave this game 1 star for effort.', 'Too much energy needed, you can say strategy all you want but 45-80 energy to cut down a tree/ block, when you have 50 to start. One turn and your done. If your lucky enough to get resources for more energy with in 5 minutes your waiting again. Love the premise of the game, but needs a better solution than "" strategy"" to make game play more longer.', ""****UPDATE*** I followed all the instructions and it works. Unfortunately the other reviewers are correct. Takes far too much game energy to play. Level 8 and above, You open the app, break some rocks or chop some trees and you're done. (32 seconds) Close the app, wait a couple of HOURS, open it back up, break some rocks or chop some trees, (25 seconds) you're done.*** Can't run it, says I don't have enough space?

I have no interest in games like this one, and wanted to play the game that was advertised, which appeared to be a strategy based, problem solving game. This is just another Farmville experience. I'm not sure why it is advertised the way that it is, to a completely different genre of people. If you advertised it to the right demographic, you'd get people that actually wanted to play it."", 'Enjoying the game, playing at my own pace. It takes quite a long time to gain your ""energy points""..I would change this feature. For those who are new to the game, try to clear everything before going on to the next location as you will find things to increase your energy. If you can, get the ""Hotel"" as it gives you 50 extra workers. Also, I have 30 ""feed"" for each kind of farm animal in my ""bag"". I hope this helps the newcomers in the game. Cupid Park was GREAT!', ""Great game but frustrating that you dont get enough energy to do anything. Most of the tasks take 100's of energy but you can only acccumulate a very small amount at a time so can only play in short bursts. Due to this it doesnt keep you engaged. The energy accumulation needs to be increased at each level, even if only by 10. You can make energy but you need to have energy to collect the things needed to make it, good as an extra but not enough."", ""I've really got into this game now, so amending my previous review. I still get frustrated by the lack of given energy, but have now found a few ways of creating it. I wish that things didn't take so much of it tho as Id like to play a bit longer than I can. I enjoy the special games that appear and enjoyed the cupid one. I am a bit impatient tho waiting for energy or a way to get it, so would definately like more daily rewards or more things like sweet shop."", 'False advertising. Nothing like ad shows. Not a ""pin-pull"" puzzle game. Just a farmville knockoff. And the responses to others\' complaints on this issue are met with claims that the misleading ads are showing game from another view? Only if that view is complete hallucination. No. This did not meet expectations of anyone who saw the misleading ad. 0-stars', 'I truly love this game and would give it 5 stars...BUT for some reason they only start you out each time with 51 energy points. And you can burn through that in less than five minutes...I keep saying I am gonna delete the game but I play it and keep getting pulled back in. If it would build up energy faster or go higher than 51 that would make it perfect. You can earn extra energy in the game doing some activities but its VERY few and far between.', 'This game is fun and addictive, but you can not play without spending quite a bit of $$$. There are certain essential things you need that can only be bought. You have to buy workers to run everything after you spend tons of money and time setting up dairies, bakeries, glass blowing, factories, and more things needed to produce products to sell. When you run out of natural resources there is a research facility to make anything you need, but it takes 45 minutes & often comes up short.', 'Worst rip off ever. I advanced to 15, and am at a virtual stand still. One of the things you do, is fill orders, for building items, XP and coins. A certain vendor, is the one you need, for this. Almost 2 weeks since I spent a very small amount? (Which I had done time to time) No more vendor. The algorithm, has changed. Do not download.', 'Interesting game, good challenges. Further you get in levels, takes too long to get anywhere unless you spend money to advance. Only get high of 60 coin no matter how far you advance. Level 6 now and most targets take 120 coin. Can get extra coin every so often but can only get 15 points every 5 mins so only can build up coin enough for one target. Takes hours to get into each section unless spent a lot of your own money as most games get when you advance. Coin should increase with each level.', ""The game started pretty good but it was not long before I kept running out of power to do anything and it was very hard to get money as well. that is why I gave it a 3 In response That would have been nice to know at the beginning. If I were to restart the game I would do better but where I am now in the game I'm screwed. Maybe if there was better training from the start it would help."", ""Too bad you don't get extra energy for completing tasks. The energy goes way too fast and if you don't want to spend money, you do a lot of waiting for refills. It is also set that energy stops refilling at 53 and that goes quick. It would be better to have energy build higher or at the very least require less to do tasks."", ""The game has potential, but it is definitely a pay to play game. Don't download this game if you don't want to spend a large amount of money to have enough energy to play efficiently. Responses to other reviews say you have to use strategy to decide what to spend your energy on. This is not true. If you want to progress in the game you have to use energy. With 50 energy you can clear maybe 5 feet in game before you are spent and have to buy more or wait a long time before you can continue."", ""Its ridiculous how the energy does not regenerate. I'm getting so frustrated,mad upset and irritated with it not being a fair game. Yes you are right. But you have to have the energy to clear the land.And it by far does not replenish near as fast as it uses it up. Thts just wrong. Make it more economical to play and be able to enjoy it. Still not satisfied with the energy on this game. We should be able to use the money we make on the game to buy energy as well. Tht would make it better some."", ""Overall I really like the game. Giving 1 start since I can't open the game anymore since the last update. Also there's just not enough energy given to play more than a few minutes every couple hours. At level 20+, only having ~55 energy is kinda ridiculous. Instead of going up 1 energy point per level it should give you at least 10, which still isn't much in this game but better than 1. Edit: After 9 days of being unable to open and play a game I've spent real money on, I'm uninstalling. Smh"", ""This game is frustrating because you run out of energy to quick to get anything done. It takes 8 energies and UP to remove bushes to trees, when you only have 50 energies to use. It's like they're forcing you to buy green gems to buy energy. I spent $4 on a special and I'm not doing anymore. I'm going to have to quit this game. üôÅ"", ""I just want to point out that the annoying ad that keeps popping up on every game I play is inaccurate, foxes don't attack animals as big as sheep, a wolf would have been much more accurate although a little cliche. As someone who owns a pet fox and watches many of these ads, I get a little more pissed each time I see it."", ""I love the game itself, but there are a few things I think could be improved. Eggs are an item that's used in a lot of things, as well as being packed yet the hen's don't produce enough, the hen house doesn't hold enough. Items for energy produced in the missions need to spawn just a bit more. Is it possible for the candy store to regenerate faster? Waiting 5 hours or more tends to keep players from returning swiftly as the amount of energy that they receive in an hour might be used up fast."", 'The game needs more chances to play longer. Have ads to watch for extra gems or energy. Be able to convert coins to diamonds and diamonds to coins. Have apps you can download to give you diamonds and coins as well. Love the game just hate not having energy to play longer after ive searched all the islands for treasure. And done as much as i could to level up again.', ""Here is the thing. This game is really good and very fun and engaging but... it need lots of money to keep playing it. You run out of energy so freaking fast and then you'd have to wait quiet a while. Which by the way it gets me out of the flow I'm in while playing this game. The emeralds are also very expensive in my opinion, I don't think I'd be able to keep purchasing them at such a price. So I'm very sad to say this but ... goodbye I'm uninstalling the game. :/"", ""I really enjoy playing this game, however, there are a limited amt of energy resources. It would be nice to have more ways to get energy so you can extend your playing time without making purchases. It really makes no sense to me to purchase anything on these games bc you're only purchasing time,which is endless, leading to people spending endless amts of real money. Great for the maker, not for addictive personalities. Think before you spend bc you're buying time with nothing to show for it."", ""it's a fun game to pass the time with, my only complaint is that you start with so few energies and everything takes so much to clear it takes forever maybe make them a bit more in sync, also closing one land after you've moved on not cool I'd like to still work on all my opened adventures! just sayin! I'm editing my review of this game IT WAS FUN TO PASS TIME WITH BUT NO MORE!

You\'d have to spend major $$$ to play this game properly. You cut down 2 trees and your ""energy"" is out. Digging up bushes for the ""fruit energy "" is the same damned way. And the energy cost to dig/cut/chop/mine everything up is utterly ridiculous. Your energy refills 1 point every 1.5 minutes, give me a break. You do have a furnace and sweet shop to refill, but still not worth the time. Would be fun to play if it didn\'t cost an arm and leg.', 'The game is fun, but you run out of energy too fast! Some things take more energy than youve got to start with and you have to go back after your energy refills (Im at level 35 with a cap of 60 energy?)

Also, Ive got like 600k in gold, and nothing to spend it on! Maybe make it so you can trade gold for gems or energy?', ""The game itself is ok. I downloaded only it to get diamonds. I was going to delete it, but the story line started getting interesting. The problem I have is with support .

Had no clue what it was. then I started playing. after a couple hours i was hooked. Excellent game. awesome Idea. only flaw. Instructions on how to use some of the items. still dont know how to use the battle tokens. Thats it. still 5 stars. P.S. The commentary from the characters is priceless. Love it.', ""This is a great game and I would recommend it to any mobile gamers. This gets funner and funner the more you play, and with events always out it's every more to add. The dialogue between Sid (the master) and his cult members are funny. On top of that, the gameplay is amazing. You always are unlocking new things like monsters or areas or demons. You can even prestige and get a kitchen and many other things. You can fight the heroes with unlocked abilities and more. Overall, a great fun experience"", ""The game is cute but maybe I just haven't played many idle games but upgrading a room should not cause it to consume more resources. This makes the game a little hard to manage. Also I think the chants should be permanent. The game very quickly comes to a screeching halt by the 3ed idle. The apocalypse doesn't feel like its doing much and you end up spending all the souls getting the same stuff you already had just to try to get a little more In the next one."", ""The art is *wonderful*, the gameplay is far more engrossing than most idle games, and the banter of the characters is exactly the kind of sarcastic 4th wall breaking that I adore. I bought ad removal, but if you don't want to they're not intrusive; you only need watch the ads to get bonuses, the game is perfectly playable without them, just slower. I bought it to support the devs more than anything else!"", ""This game has awesome art style, music, and dialog. I am a big fan of how the ads are used. You can watch 3 ads in a row to get an 8hr boost for various buffs for your floors/monsters, and before the timer is up, you can watch 1 ad to refresh them all. And every 5min you can watch an ad to get valuable resources. You have to manage each of floors and what they're producing to keep upgrading, and I love that you can spam punch the heros to get additional resources while you're waiting around."", ""This game is awesome in so many ways, but lately it has been crashing since i bought the super generator. It starts with some lag and then it stops working. Please support team, check it out cause it¬¥s getting annoying after it crashes several times at day. I really wanna buy the tesla room but I'm thinking about it due the game functionallity. Hail Sid!!! Hail DOOM!!!"", ""Lovely little game, quite a bit of fun. The only issue I've been having is that when it comes to receiving the bonuses from ads (like wheels tokens, time bonuses, etc) the ads won't play at all. I've tried restarting the game but they simply won't play. Odd, I know, to complaign about ads not appearing. They're par for the course on a game like this, though, and at least (normally) there is a benefit to then."", ""I really enjoy this game. It's good that you don't have to be super active to progress! I, also enjoy how you can unlock permanent rooms the more you progress. It gives you a reward for playing. But I think a good option would be removing adds for in game currency, like a million or billion souls; at least something between those. Nevertheless, I will be playing this game for a long time."", ""Extremely fun, it's not like other idle games Because you get most of your resources when online, but it's still an idle game for a few reasons. Very artisticly animated, maybe lacking some animations in some obvious regions, but still amazing. But that's just me, I'm all about animation. Totally recommended tho. Good job, Grumpy Rhino Games!"", ""I've had it for a few weeks and just...really enjoy it. The pixel graphics are gorgeous and the game is whimsical and straight-forward. They've already had like three different events in my time playing, and I haven't had to pay money or anything to get stuff out of them. Glad to be able to just watch ads for boosts and support the game."", ""Charming pixel idle game. The writing is quite good. It's not the very best idle game but it's close; and while does ask for some of your money, I was more than happy to pay up to see more. The grind could be abated quite a bit, as my main complaint is that even after 20 Apocalypses or so, it still takes about a week to do a full cycle. In other words the growth is not exponential as in a game like Antimatter Dimensions. Apocalypse could stand to be far deeper but it's on very solid ground."", ""Prompts me to rate every 20 minutes so you lost a star because of it. Over all it's pretty good. The combat aspect should be an actual game in its self not just tap spell buttons. Super boring. Spells are pretty bland. The creatures are cool. Too many different types of resources. Scrolling between tower levels is pretty annoying and if the levels are maxed out they are just in the way. There's should only be one upgrading level. The supply drop ship is completely confusing. Do better. Fun tho."", ""Best idle game I've ever seen I normally never rate people and ussaualy if anything give a bad rating. I'm inpressed with your game it's fun it's a time waster I love it's 8 bit style and it doesn't take hours to get stuff like in other idle games. One of my favorites try playing this game it really impressed me you might find it amazing as well."", ""Awesome idle game! I just recently stumbled upon iron horse games and I'm in love with the couple i started playing. this one doesn't disappoint. it's not very easy managing resources to upgrade but it's fun doing trial and error to get things right. give it a try you just might like it.!"", ""This game needs a big update before I can give anymore stars. Progression is really slow, needs more upgrades on production speed and the amount of resources you get. Needs more gameplay in the combat, like a better way to interact with it, because it's is super boring as it is, you don't even see the champions fall over once they just stand there the whole time, like there should be more to it in my opinion, and there should be more rewards from combat. And I think there should be more tapping"", ""Idler where you build up your ability to go further down the tech chain between cycles. Style, is good, and the mechanics are clear and work well, my only slight issue is the progression feels slow. If that doesn't bother you it's a good way to idle away time."", 'This game is a lot of fun,my only problem with it is the fact that you have to restart the game to get some required items(Ex:the souls to make the soul hammers to build floors like the juicer).other then that problem,this is a great game!', 'I love the game, it doesnt force ads down your throat, the imagery looks amazing, and you can just tell that this game was actually made with love and only for being a game and nit some cash grab. And with that, i absolutely love it all.', ""Enjoyable overall, aside from having to tap your generators constantly to keep your bonus going. You have to rapidly tap each one around 250 times to get the full bonus and there's up to 6 you can unlock. Fun to playthrough and manage your tower, but the 1000+ rapid taps every day is annoying."", 'A good time killer, however the save feature does not recover purchases, as i had paid for ad removal on my Xperia and switching to a upgraded phone, find that ads are back and things i paid for are missing, and as much as I like the game, im not paying for the same thing twice.', 'Lets be clear, You will NEVER unlock everything with out spending real world money at some point and time. HOWEVER!!! This game is a lot of fun. You do NOT need to spend money to move forward and the random draw items are actually balanced.', ""So far the only idle game I enjoy because it isn't fully automated and the player has some things that they can do along with the charm in the pixel art and dialogue that is spruced in every now and again is just bliss to the eyes and personally one of the better games on the appstore."", ""This game really makes me think retro and it takes me to a time that I didn't live in the gameplay and interactions are amazing andI like how you can start the apocalypse whenever you want also I like the little word bubbles overall it is a great game and makes me laugh."", 'Decent game. Has a purchase option to remove ads, which is nice. Very slow start. Resource management is a constant tug of war that can be a minor hassle. Humor is a big plus. The dialogue is quite entertaining.', 'The game play is very simple and easy to pick up, and there is witty banter included for a few hood laughs! Plus the ad free pack comes at a reasonable price to support the devs and also remove pesky ads!! Well done on the game guys!!!', ""This has so much to do and is the absolute best idle games I've ever played, it has fun dialogue, many options for the gameplay and it's just really enjoyable I'm very glad I got it it's really fun and very well made üòäüëç"", ""This is a great game! I really love that you have to start over and over and you get stronger every time! This game was a great experience! And I hope that there is going to be new game from the developers! And guys don't stop with the good work!"", ""This game is amazing, there's not much else to say. I love idle games and the feel and idea of this one is just amazing. Probably one of my favourite idle games ever. Anyone reading this should 100% play this game."", ""Ultimately as idle games go, this one is one of the most entertaining and least money-grubbing one I've experienced in recent memory. This game has charm and is a fantastic little experience."", ""The game is REALLY fun and all (and i'm NOT kidding when I say it's fun), but the problem is it's WAY too long to progress and each time you activate the apocalypse, you have to RESTART."", ""This is a really cool game! I love the concept of fighting for evil instead of for good, since most games don't have that option. I wouldn't ever do this stuff in real life, but still, the concept is cool."", ""Very fun and addicting. Deffinetly worth getting. This game is good if you like tycoon. But it's better. It has a story line and humor. Very fun. GET IT!"", 'Great game mechanics, and all the diolog is funny as hell. Its a dream come true to run a cult, and i couldnt ask for a better group of fictional characters to help me destroy the world', ""I love the style! And the little conversations are great. I'm not bombarded by ads, and the heroes are very cool. There's always something to do! Awesome game."", 'When I realised that the stage level does not increase during the offline time that the game is still suppose to be advancing, I understood that I completely wasted the money I spent on this game.', 'This is a brilliant game that sets the bar for how a good idle game should play. My only gripe so far is the Metamorphose spell requiring carful timing to get the best use out of it.', ""So far it's really fun, no ads very fun gameplay and I love the little remarks the characters make when you go to a different area of the game."", ""I like how it makes an apocalypse but I have the Larth and I have a dark altar but not the mines,not the kitchen.it's interesting but make more idle games so everybody enjoys your games!do your best as possible!I love your games!(Benoit)<3#idleapocalypse"", 'Great game for mindless playing. You still benefit from playing rather than only gaining from letting the game sit. Some of the jokes are pretty funny as well.', 'Progress is way too slow. Also being offline you can accumulate only 25% of production for max 4h, which is some kind of a sick joke considering they advertise game as idle. The only great part are in game jokes and conversations between cultists.']"

Other games are called interactive but this is what I call INTERACTIVE GAMEü§óü§óü§ó"", ""Great graphics, awesome game... My only problem is that there's no other way to get diamonds... I wanted a game that I could play after a long day of cooking, cleaning and taking care of my kids... Maybe there should be an option to watch and share ads to get extra diamonds..."", ""No matter what choice you select, you'll always end up with same result at the end and story will go as its decided to be.. Also there's one error ... After completing an episode sometimes it doesn't load adds to gsin more diamonds."", ""I really like the game the stories are really good but I think they should give us more tickets and more diamonds at the start of the game. Some things like clothes shouldn't have the need to be paid and the limit of videos to watch to gain diamonds should be bigger."", ""First time trying out this kind of game and it's alot of fun. Great graphics and storylines. Just would like to have more free tickets to start new episodes!!!!"", 'Interesting plots, great variety of stories, overall a good app but I wish the scenes I pay for were longer and there was a bigger variety of free outfits. Oh, and too many ads.', 'Love it the only thing is you need to change the amount of dimands it takes to pick a better option the amounts are high and they should be low like between 5 and 10 and the tickets you give should be 4 instead of 2', 'New to this game and like it so far. Wish there were more ways to get diamonds besides paying for them. Takes a long time for diamonds to add up by just watching ads.', 'I really recommend this game, it really has great stories. I suggest adding up some free tickets? I think 2 tickets are not enough. Also, I think 2 hrs is too long for the ticket to refill', ""I preferred that if you could tell me how many seasons of recipe of love is really are. That's all. Above that if would be great if the waiting time for new ticket refills are reduced a bit more ."", 'Really great stories - pity about the costs (you pay for each episode as well as better choices) . But the story line is incredible and you invest into the characters- enjoying it more than tv!', ""Amazing. But cost 4 ticket and diamonds are too high. Make more free cloths 4 more fun and make it easier to pick required choices without paying much diamonds. I think dis won't discourage players 4rm playing due 2 high cost."", 'I love the game i just hate that you get little diamonds and i have to wait to get the tickets, if only you get those by watching ads that way we use data instead of cash', 'In order to play out the choices You would like to make, You have to spend money to get diamonds. Just like every other game similar.', 'It would be better if you had more then two tickets. I went all day without playing and still end up with all two tickets.', ""I enjoy the app and stories, but, PLEASE do something about the frustrating stalling issues that occur OFTEN, usually during a musical switch between scenes or when silently switching scenes. Also, why does the app take so LONG to load into the first scene at times? Other times, it's fast. The issues mentioned make the app very tedious to play. One episode took me close to 45 minutes to complete with all of the stalling involved. What on earth is the problem with these issues?! Please fix them."", 'It was just okay at first. The ""good"" choices take 19+ diamonds to pick. You can only have 2 tickets at a time, and it takes 2 hours to load 1 ticket. That\'s ridiculous in my opinion. You can\'t design your own characters either, like you can in similar games. However, now that the update came out, it\'s even worse. I constantly get a ""cannot connect to server"" error. Whether I\'m on WiFi or not. Same message. Worthless app if I can\'t get on it.', 'It is almost fun, except the game makes major decisions for you and the choices you do get are often pointless. Yes, you can choose if you yell or cry if your bf cheats BUT you say 2 sentences to a new guy and the game just decide you kiss him. Or you date 2 guys and only like one, but the game decides you love them both and lead them on. It feels a bit invasive, and often...nonconsensual.', 'It would be more convenient if there will be an option to watch videos for getting free passes.', ""Finally! Great choices game that won't run you broke. The stories are interesting. You still need diamonds for some choices but you can earn the diamonds by watching videos and completing chapters. The chapters are short so you get diamonds quick. If you miss out on being able to make a decision because of not having enough diamonds the scenario may be approached later depending on the flow of the story. Great game."", ""I really like the stories. What I don't like is that You ask for too many diamonds for answers. Also, the tyckes, what's up with that?? Do we get one every 24 hours?? I have spend money on apps before but because wanted too. Please fix that some how. Other than that I'm really enjoying the stories, is really captivating,. Thank you! Edit: I really like the stories, but could I dress my character with a different clothing without paying?? Thank you!!"", ""I love the trajectory of the stories. Also the suspense of waiting for tickets makes me want to keep playing. It gives me great satisfaction. Also, though I dont control everything, I like that I can choose oh and it gets frustrating when my diamonds aren't enough to make an important decision. Lol. I love it. I would like more tickets."", ""Everything is superb but too costly tickets... And very few tickets available for free. Idk if u care but no onr will pay dollars to play episodes (tickets) as well as making choices(diamonds).... People will pay for few days and find something else where they don't have to hault. Guys, u need to give tickets in less time or make decisions cheaper. Or after a few days.. People will forget this game"", ""Fantastic yet annoying!!! You get completely invested in your character since its you making the decisions however the only way you can really enjoy the game is to invest in several tickets and diamonds. Then comes the downside of only getting 2 tickets and even better you will not ever be allowed to get any more than those 2 tickets. And no they don't build up that's it just 2 you want more buy more they don't add tickets to what you buy like other games."", ""This is much better than some of the other apps I've tried. It's sometimes sad that i can't choose certain options because i don't have enough gems but other games make me look like a complete fool because i can't pay for answers. This game i don't look like a complete fool in the one book but in the other book i did look badly and selfish. It's nice that you can earn 4 gems after each chapter."", 'Why you give only 2 tickets, and refill lasts almost 2 hours for 1. It doesnt make sense. At least reduce the waiting time for refill', ""I need to restart my phone every time to get a new ticket. Restarting my phone is the only option, otherwise the ticket is not here, though it should be. I don't know where is the problem, but it's pretty annoying that I have to restart my phone every time to get a new ticket."", ""You give only 2 tickets and wait for 2-3 hours?! And In some episodes,you can't freely pick your decision because you need to have many diamonds for that! i hate it!"", ""Best game ever , it's unbelievablely interesting üíñüíìjust extordinaryy, if ur looking for interactive story games , blindly download this , worth your data , one suggestion would be increasing the max stack of tickets to 3 and reducing the time to obtain one ticket as 1 hour or 1.5 hours instead of 2 ,looking forward to it , thank you"", ""I really love this app. It's very entertaining however, I have two main issues with it; The amount of tickets given should be increase to 4 and the time to retrieve another ticket should be minimized to 20mins."", 'The stories and graphics are great but wish they could give more tickets to play the next episodes. Have to wait 2 hours for a new ticket. Overall a very good game.', 'Stories are great but the fact is that you charge too much for something is a novel, a comic book is less expensive than this, and honestly myself i have spended money on the app but i feel im throwing the money in the trash even if the novels are good....', ""I love this game but I gives only 2 ticket to read the stories 2 is too little not fair .. and it take long time to load also I hope you guys can fix those two problems .. apart from that it's an awesome game"", 'A few days ago I was not allowed to download this game through the google playstore. I downloaded this as a Google Apk because of my desire to play this game. After playing for a while, it stopped work. automatically banned for me. After a few days the phone was updated. after that this game was allowed to download through the google playstore. I was banned to play it even when downloaded through google playstore. Currently I am playing zoe. How to get rid from banned. I love to play this game.', 'Stories are great, interesting. Keeps you wanting to find out what happens. Funny at times also. Easier to earn diamonds than most. Had a small issue technically and customer service responded right away and fixed it...I love this game!', ""Finally found a game that suits me and makes me excited. Not kinda boring. It's very well. But those tickets ruins it. I always lacks tickets so I loses excitement sometimes over an episode. But it is awesome! I highly recommend this game."", ""An interactive game where you don't have much choice unless you buy credits. Such a shame because it is a good game with good quality image and scenarios but it's sponsored so you get adds but you still have to pay!"", 'This game is very amazing I play every time whenever i feel bored And the stories are very interestimg I m very glad to download this game But the. Problem is that the good options needed diamond . Although it is gud', ""it is very amusing but the thing is I can not get more diamonds by clicking the diamond object then I have to choose the one choice I am left with...which is not fare.. don't know how to fix it!!!"", 'Lags really bad sometimes. The stories are great otherwise! I just hate how it takes so long to get tickets and you have the option to watch 4 videos at the end of each chapter so that helps with making premium choices!!']"

I docked a star because of a weird but valid reason: the game has no consequences... Crash the bus at 140mph, have multiple collisions, give your passengers the bumpiest ride ever--there's absolutely no damage to your bus, and frankly it's like all the passengers care about is WiFi and comfort. Give the game some consequences to make me drive more carefully. It's boring without them"", ""It's a vey nice game.. I love the graphics and all that stuff but i still think it needs more upgrade. Like 1. There should be cops to chase you when you disobey traffic rules and possibly arrest you. 2. The vehicle should be damaged when you have an accident 3. You should possibly be arrested for driving recklessly and pay a certain fine. These three things will make the game more fun.. Thanks"", ""I love the graphics, I love the texture of the game but I hate the cockpit instability. Secondly, there is no heavy traffic in the game.

Can I rate negative stars?"", ""Pretty good idle game, only suggestion is that when you prestige, make it easier to get back up through the levels.

Unfortunately, it's utterly ruined by the ridiculous number of ads they shoehorn into EVERYTHING. Want a bonus? Ad. Want to increase your conveyor belt production? Ad.

So Whenever you prestige and go to the very beginning you'll be gaining levels very quickly. And having to press level up and then wait for the option to watch an ad to pop up. Really prevents you from quickly leveling up. So it takes several minutes to level all the way up to where the xp gain is slow.

However if there one thing that I find utterly unacceptable is the ad related issues. It takes over a minute for the game to get a ad ready, it's bad enough that I have to watch an ad to get a boost or double income or whatever maybe the case but to then add that long delay between viewing ads is a thorn in the side that makes me not to want to get too deep into the game because the ads will drive me away."", ""Good 3d gfx / physics for idle factory genre.

New Ultimate Board Games scenario
Make a best-selling board game in this radically different scenario that has nothing to do with disease!

New Science Denial scenario
People around the world have stopped believing in science, medicine and even diseases.","[""Yet to reach locked content, but I'm already a huge fan! Love the gameplay. One thing I'd say is a world highscore board seems pointless as the top scores are basically ones with cheats activated. Also, maybe add more details to the local scoreboard. As in, not just the disease name, but the type and difficulty. It's kind of hard to remember what i named each one. ;) Great work, guys, will probably buy after completing levels."", ""I've really enjoyed this game since I was introduced to it several years ago. I enjoyed it even more in previous years, when it wasn't necessary to accomplish a successful plague in one category, before trying another. I felt less pressure when I could between infections as I chose. Still, it's an interesting and satisfying game, and could also be used to explore and examine the relationships between different social, biological, and medical factors, which increases the interest."", 'Fun the first few times. After a dozen playthroughs, though, you get a sense that this is all there is. The ""progress"" in the game is blocked behind a paywall. You can EARN new genes by winning on Normal difficulty, but you can\'t actually USE them? That was a big turnoff, to have won my first game and then slammed right into your paywall. You lost me as a player right then and there.', ""You need the premium version to unlock many game mechanics. The game is full of micro transactions. I wouldn't mind the micro transactions if it weren't for the following in the the free versions 1.) You can't use fast forward. 2.) You can unlock genes, but not use any. The game is fun, but bring asked to pay for features that should be in the base game is ridiculous"", 'No. Just no. Fun to play, however DO NOT PURCHASE ANYTHING. I had mine ""saved"" in Google and had my phone stolen. No problem, right? Wrong I had the full version, over 30.00 in purchases and tried to install in my new device and I have lost, EVERYTHING. After contacting the developers, nothing. Apparently these people are not aware of good business practices. If so, they would not have released this without a way to save purchases. Play it, it\'s enjoyable. Do not spend any currency here because they will not assist you in any way at all. I will be sure to write about it in my future blog.', 'Very fun, cool and interesting game, but kinda hard to win. I just had my first victory in casual mode. I wish you would get more DNA points near the end, that makes it extremely hard to actually win. If you devolve something, you only get 2 DNA points, but you could have spent 35 or more DNA on it. I think it should be refunded based on percentage of how much you used to evolve it. Like 1 point from something you got for 2 and 5 from something you got for 30; and 2 from mutations.', 'I have always loved this game so i was excited to get it on my new phone. At first, itd play for 30 minutes to an hour before kicking me out and making me start all over. So i uninstalled it then reinstalled it. Now i get less than 5 minutes of game play before it goes out and makes me start over. Please please fix i miss this game', ""I REGRET PAYING for this buggy game. There is a game speed issue that has been around for a long time. Support MIGHT answer after a few days, but with a canned and therefore meaningless response. If they haven't fixed this issue in years, they never will. Just milk consumers with a buggy game as long as you can. Boycott Miniclip games. We can vote with our wallets since our voices don't seem to matter."", ""I have tried playing this game on and off for some time and while the concept is excellent the strategy side is, well, one sided. The whole point is to strategically spread a disease across the globe yet, for example, when a cure is found it is micraculously distributed immediately globally, no matter how depleted the population is. This similation has the capibility to be so much richer and complex but, I think, is too focused on the 'pay to win' aspects."", ""This is the most satisfying game I ever played. The only things that make this game bad is that you can't customize your plauge without having to get the premium version of the game and the fact that the load game thing doesn't have a menu to choose your disease world. But I give this game a five-star rating because of how satisfying it is to actually play the game."", 'Rigid game structure. Good luck winning. I cant even get past the first pandemic type of bacteria no matter how hard I try. This game is rigged to be very difficult to beat to force you to pay for upgrades. The points structure is messed up, especially when you have infected all countries, good luck even being able to interact with the game further. Great concept, poor poor execution. Do not recommend to waste your time.', 'I love the game, its amazing, but I feel it could do with a bit of a redesign to make it look more like the ios version. Also, the reason its not getting 4 or 5 stars is the tutorial popups that come up evry game. I know how to play, i have been playing for 5 years, i think i would know that popping orange bubbles gives me dna points by now. PLEASE fix.', ""Five stars for concept and gameplay. it's a classic. I would like to see some upgrades to the graphics and perhaps some additional options for controlling the parameters of the epidemics. Nevertheless, it's a fantastic and well-balanced simulation. I would even use it in an introductory epidemiology course. Besides, you win by annihilating humanity. Sometimes, that actually makes me sad. Final rating? A fantastically twisted great time!"", ""Usually works great, but suddenly stopped playing the in-game music. Still get the creepy background sounds, but the music just stopped working. While not important, it's strange because no matter what I do I can't get it to play. Worked fine yesterday. But even after completely deleting the game data and starting from scratch it didn't work."", ""This game is GREAT. I love it so much, but it doesnt earn 5 stars for me just for the fact that the heart rate monitor makes ur ears bleed when you are wearing headphones. Not only that, but if ur playing without headphones and since everything else is quiet, you won't notice the volume is on until *BEEP BEEP BEEP* and everyone in a range of 5 miles hears you. Just turn down the heart rate monitor sound. Its SUPER loud"", 'The worst game ever. This is a pay to win game. I played the game won the brutal levels of bacteria and virus. However when I came to play spores the game will not let me win. I had infected every country to 100% except canada, iceland, and Greenland. There were 35 million people still not affected. And the disease was not even noticed however, the infectivity was so slow when it came to these three countries. Only in about three or four days (game time 1 min) would one person get infected.', ""This is a fun game, I played it back in the days. Bad news for me, this game is unable to connect to the play store and restore my purchase which is very frustrating. I've done what a lot of fourns said to do. Well, here is to a second round... Which I find VERY odd that I can connect to leave a rating and not restore my account. 2 star"", ""Decided to get this game again because it's been a while. Same experience except for the fact that now half of the experience is locked behind a paywall and I need to pay 99¬¢ to do something as simple as FAST FORWARDING THE GAME!!! Why?? I'm not even allowed to see the info of each country. Why?? Those were pivotal features in the game now locked by a paywall. Absolutely ridiculous."", ""This game is a piece of art in the mobile gaming industry. I've had the game for many years now and never got board, it constantly persists to be a challenging strategy game that is constantly putting YOU in a race against time. Not to save humanity, no, but to destroy it. With a variety of differences in plagues, this sadistic simulation will make you question the next strategic path you take to wipe out the human race and all life on earth."", 'I\'ve played through it all on brutal difficulty, yet I had to get a new device because as all devices do, it broke down. I love the game but the restore progress button does not work at all. It just shows it loading ""restoring progress"" but it never does and I can still click around the menu as if it wasn\'t there. I don\'t have the time or energy to play through it all again on brutal.', 'I absolutely love this game ! Literally. You learn so much from it and it\'s also fun! As I\'m also into studying bacteria and diseases, this helps alot! What inspired me to play this game was when I saw other youtubers play it and I was like ""Wow that game looks so fun!"" So then I started playing. Keep up the awesome games and I\'ll keep playing!', ""I downloaded the game again after a long time. So now devs decided to make it more pay to play instead of fun. It's really a shame. Pop up ads included, fast forward now has a price?! What next, to exit game we have to pay? Some major companies inspired small devs to do the same. I still love the game though but I think paying mobile game is ridiculous."", ""Absolutely adore this game, the depth of experience is brilliant and the effect in-world events have on the spread of your disease is genius. The only slight issue I've noticed is one of logic. Once a country is completely infected, without the world noticing the disease, shouldn't all planes and boats carry the infection? Only noticed this issue after the whole world was infected yet the planes & boats were still mostly white. Just felt I should point it out. Great game!!!!!"", 'Your account and purchases seem to be locked to your device, so that if you ever get a new phone, you will lose all of your progress and all of your purchases. There is a ""restore purchase"" button, but like everyone who tries it has reported, it does not work. It\'s a bummer because I really liked the game, but I\'m not going to spend more money on content that I can\'t keep when I get a new phone.', ""Great game but doesn't share info across devices even when connected to Google play. This is the only game I've come across that is this way. Any progress made on whatever device is only on that device. It sucks. I'm glad I haven't bought the extras because phones and tablets don't last forever. Heed the advice of others and don't pay for anything in this game people."", ""In all a good game, but I prefer the computer version, which I've the feeling is more accurate. Since there are issues with saves of the purchases, I didn't bother to buy anything. That line just cracked me up: Cheap, Clean power discovered Green tech firm claims to have developped a power station that runs entirely on laughter and joy. Denies reports of oil barrels nearby."", ""I actually do love this game, always have, however now it crashes in the middle of every single game I play. I tried clearing the cache and that didn't work, as well as uninstalling and reinstalling. This makes it near impossible to play, as it crashes so early in the game. I would love to have this fixed so I could keep playing this game, as it is absolutely great otherwise. For information, I'm using a Samsung Galaxy Note9, app and phone completely updated."", 'Amazing game. I love games that actually require skill, unlike those idle games. The mobile version is actually really good. All the different viruses and infecting other countries is epic. The thing I want in this game is a setting to remove the messages that pop up on your screen. But anyways, awesome game! I would love to have the pc version, but this is awesome too. Thanks Devs! :D', ""In general, in the first hours of the game when you are completing some challenges and unlocking new types of disease, it is quite fun, but when you try to leave the standard scenario, the game leaves you cornered. The extra actions that should improve the game like extra genes or other scenarios are reclusive for those who pay. And there are no updates since the last one was in 2019. The interface is also not as refined as the one used on the PC. Overall, you CAN'T progress without money."", ""I loved every second of playing this game. It's great fun..... But please please rebalance the Simian Flu and Shadow Plague. They're both so difficult on mobile that they're not worth playing at all. I get that you want to keep it similar to the computer version but on this we have to drag and drop, which makes the screen move with our finger sometimes. Please either change the ability interface or make it easier."", ""Used to be great.. now pay to play... As with a majority of good games out there, now you have to pay to do almost anything in the game.. also I don't understand why the cure 'speed' increases sometimes. In one game I had killed 99% of the population, infected everyone and somehow the remaining 22 people developed a cure in roughly 90 seconds and I was defeated... Strannngggeee."", ""This app is AMAZING! it's quite an original idea: name and spread a disease to wipe out the earths population. However, the reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is simply because of the difficulty! Even on casual it is still a mad struggle... I would've given it 3 if I dislike a challenge anyway, but that challenge should be optional in my opinion. Unrelated suggestion: why don't you add an ability to make it so it infects more men/women? üôÇ"", ""This used to be one of my favorite games. Now it's just sad what it's become. Like others have said, you can't restore progress if you get a new phone, so purchases have to be made again. Fast forwarding isn't free anymore - I mean REALLY? The app doesn't even connect anymore to Google play for me, so I'm lucky if I get to the main menu to even try and play (but what's the point). I miss this game, but it's not the same anymore. Definitely uninstalling."", ""I unlocked the full version in 2014. Tried to restore purchases now, it doesn't work. The official form to contact the developers is over complicated, asking player id I can't find in the game and documentation explains how to retrieve it in other games, but not in plague Inc. Thus I hope my negative review will help to update documentation or find a better way to claim a purchase done years ago. Game is fun, but you need to spend a lot of money to unlock many aspects, 2014 version was better."", ""Plague inc. Is a great game, and I really enjoy it. The rating would be 5 stars from me, but I found a big problem. Every time i get close to the end when the cure has started, i get approximately no disease points. This makes it just about impossible to fight the cure. Seriously guys, you need to fix this. I'm about to uninstall the game."", ""I think they have added more. I played this when I was a teenager and only beat the bacteria once and now added plague Inc creation to my wishlist. Don't know when I am going to get to buy, but besides the point I think it is fun and thank ya Because I always wanted to be able to be a designer. 100% thinking of ya fellow customers. Thanks for getting us all involved. Thumbs up"", 'Just plain boring. You have to pay for features such as the speed up option and so you have to wait around for ages for anything to happen, and I had selected a ""quick"" game. Yes it\'s not that expensive, but I\'m not going to pay if I don\'t even enjoy the game without the features. I was really excited to play this after watching let\'s plays on YouTube and honestly disappointed.', ""Not to bad of a game but in my personal opinion as a gamer I'd say it's missing something! For me I'd say it's a reference log of good an bad combos so as to better keep track of how your progress is going or not going because I highly doubt I'm the only one playing this game with short term memory loss"", ""No ads, strategy, and we'll made... All things I love in a game Also people are just doing bad reviews cuz you have to pay to make it go faster It doesn't even help!!üò° People are just angry because they have to pay to be lazy.üò§ There are a few things you can buy, and I don't like paying stuff on games, but considering the quality I would definitely pay!"", 'Every single time I change my device and load my game progress to the new phone, the in-game achievements list is not saved, setting back the overall progress. The achievements are still there in the play games app, so I asked the support team several times to link the achievements list with the play games. They just send automated messages, and even when I reply as asked and say that you are never gonna solve my issue this way, more automated messages telling me how to load progress. Very nice.']"

- New roads have been added.
- Some bug fixes have been made.","['The game is great, great graphics. For me, in order to make the game more enjoyable, i suggest that there should be a fixed map and the items to be delivered shall be in each station. So that it wont be a hassle for the players to wait for the loading and choose another load. Also i would suggest to add effects for the raining condition, the wiper doesnt play its role. Overall the game is great, perfect time killer. Hehehe', 'It was a good game but there are some things that just arent as necessary and it makes it no fun. The food and sleep bar depletes really fast so your loads begin getting delivered around the last minute because of frequent stops. On some maps there are hills you have to go up in order to deliver and they are too steep. The truck literally barely gets up them. Lastly some vehicles glitch at those tolls on the highway. Even if you lightly push them to try and make them move they wont.', ""Its just okay games but one thing that I really hate is when we take a short cut the game doesn't let us to do that and its really annoying me. Also they lets us watching a lot of ad even tho this games doesn't even need a fooking internet. 1 last thing I hate about this game its bcz they put a freaking ads right in front of the dashboard and u cant a see a fxkg things uninstalled"", 'Good game to play but there are lot of issues in playing it. Issues: 1. The maps that are display during the game play is blocking half of the vision to the road. 2.The vehicle selected in the garage is not coming after selecting a job. 3. The number plates in the truck was altered but it is not maintained in the truck but the coins were gone for that purchase. 4. When a driver completes a job,the job completion details are not displayed on the screen. It is displayed either if I reopen the game', ""Please do the gameplay same as truck games offered by ovidiu pop . The only thing I liked from zuuks games is the graphics ,controls and the international radio . It's an honest request to update it .as every time have to choose the job and then play from any city to another city . But in ovidiu pop wherever the job ends we can. Take another job from there itself and not comming back and starting from anywhere and please don't change the common things like owner, company, additional driver etc."", 'Fairly enjoyable, easy to control. However at speed on the road the SatNav would announce turns too late. Had to reverse. One turn took me down a dirt track?? Got confused, and screen started to play up. Did not know how to continue. Sorry bit too sophisticated for me. A map of where I was and going would have also been very welcome.', ""Wow..! Man what a super game it is.I'm enjoying it a lot without any bour. Really it is a awesome game. It is as a real truck stimulation, that controls, steering, the graphics,GPS voice, power of the truck. But little thing is that to enable the sensitivity of the turning of the steering across the road turning may help me to drive very smoother.But I'll give 4 stars if the game have still more updates.Thank you zuuks very nice game."", 'I giv five stars because of the amusing game it gives pleasure when playing it has mo of gud. It is so real nice graphics, control and real sound truck with good cars, traffic lights, good roads bt add more different directions roads it seems like going to one direction each trip, add more features like road humps, penalties for overspending in citis head lamps penalties if nt turned on at night like euro truck simulator2 for the pc. Waiting for the new updates from zuuks developers......', 'Exelent game. Good graphics for what it is. Decently priced vehicles. Fair damage to vehicles. You get paid good for the jobs. I also like how simmular it is to Bus Simulstor: Ultimate. All in all, I have to say this is an exelent game.', 'Awesome experience driving experience high level graphic design, realistic roads, toll, bunks, hotels, motels, awesome trucks and their control. Really enjoyed a lot unlocked all 12trucks. Need more customized options, off-road, mountain, hills, railway reacks, villages etc., loading and unloading opinions. Need more challenges options. Tq', 'Add police chase roblock, real accident like real damage in truck, crash, burn, real sound engine, add bot truck, animal, people, in day traffic busy, add car police, motor superbike, ambulance, resque, all about real life, i need game like real life, but now no have company can create game truck like real life, i hope ur company can create game truck like real life, i can buy ur game if ur sold........ I think all people can buy ur game if ur can create game truck like real life..........', ""Game is good, but the reason why I gave this game a three star is because of the prices and etc. First of all, make the prices more lower so we can afford more trucks. An average truck would cost to 30k to 75k. Also, add an option to sleep in your truck (If you have a sleeper). Also, try to make objects have their own animations like for an example when you run into a cone, your truck gets alot of damage and the cone doesn't fall. Also, don't always make flat trucks."", 'This Game is Amazing why because it has a radio where you can listen to music while driving. It has good graphics and it is all real. Keep on the amazing work!üòÄ', ""When you park for an extra $1000(The money in the game that can not be spent in the real world.)it is the hardest thing I have ever done, and I didn't even get to finish parking. When I hit exit to main menu when I was thinking I would get my normal money from driving... I didn't get any money so I uninstalled the game."", 'I love this simulator, but I would love it even more if we could get away from the level type gameplay, and make it more open world gameplay. You can pull into a lot and order a trailer to hual. I just don\'t like playing in ""levels"", if you know what I mean.', 'Love the game but I noticed the one truck Shy you need at least one so you can play yourself and you should have more trucks have to pull over at the weigh station and more vehicles on the road and speed limit or at the end of the game you get the last truck that you can just pull off the side of the road and sleep anywhere', 'The game is just extraordinary. Almost realistic. I love the radio feature, auto driving mode and many more..The game is android version of Euro truck simulator and i love it. Best truck simulation game that i played so far.', ""It doesn't mean anything at all, at least the bus couch ultimate is fun but the question is that I will be at home and the bus: Ultimate is the job you have to find coins so that you can go for the job. Thanks!"", ""This game is really got amazing graphics. Easy to control and a simple GPS to follow or to work out love this game. In my opinion I highly recommend this game for any age I'm 15 and I love it"", ""This game is so look bad! It wouldn't even let me drive ! (I thought that was the main point of the game) all it let me do was watch useless ads like it was soooooo boaring and dumb ! I reccomened not getting this bad game ! It's such a biiiig waste of your free time! I reccomened finding something else to do cause it's a waste of time! Just find another game to play! STRAIGHT AWAY!"", 'Far better than any other truck simulation, Controlling truck is way better than its counterparts, Hope so, Zuuks can offer a good update, with new locations, trucks and map too.. Really Love the gps voice support in navigation... You guys have done a great job, keep up and improve more..', ""Good Work. All things in this games are good truck roads driver, etc. Make More Games Like This Game, And Put More Level's Roads And City's In This Game. I'll give 4 stars, but the next time I'll give 5 stars of your work."", ""This game sucks and is stupid. The radio stations don't work at all just Latino and KPop only. And running into a green light will give you a fine and the parking is too difficult because the trucks are too big and the sleep/eating health goes down too quickly that I have to stop in town in the middle of a hurry. And it takes way too much of my data UNINSTALLING üôÑüò°"", ""The game is good but, issue about the ads on the fuel indication spot because, I can't see that how much of fuel is left. otherwise everything is good, like GPS voice, navigation and radio. finally the game is below average not bad"", 'Fund game to play it is abit hard because when you are fuel you have to faster go to fuel station even though if you go to checkpoin the hardest is you need to park it perfectly that is the want that is so delay my time just to park properly haiss but is ok dont give up and thank you and bye bye pls rate me thx bye.', 'this is the best game ive ever played. it is so realistic, and so so fun, ive had this for over a year and im not getting bored of it. props to the devs, they are so great at making games and everything they have put on the app store is worth playing.', 'This is fairly good game needs alot more updates like company trucks roads jobs and the ability to change gear box to manual or standard and it need a WiFi section also the game need better theme and need to see other truck company along the road with their trucks it need a truck wash system a party mode system etc think about it', 'Great game with limited opportunities to grow your company. Once you buy all the trucks (12) it quickly becomes pretty boring. Driving experience is realistic and enjoyable.', ""great game but fix the mirrors especially when you're driving inside the truck it's fake make them as they are on the trucks in real life. and also fix this problem too especially when finding job you don't have to go back to the main menu and also add offline radio."", 'Claims to be an ""offline"" game, but requests to be connected to the internet whenever I click on the button to go driving. False advertising. Here\'s a 1 star rating for your lie. Uninstalled.', ""Basically a fun game, I enjoy the ride. Some details could be better. The missions lack a feeling of being a 'campaign'. Controls are decent, but seem to switch when driving in reverse, ruining a perfect parking job. Windshield wipers and headlights are useless, rain does not obscure vision and even driving past a police car with lights off doesn't do anything. Finally, I've successfully made very sharp turns at full speed without any effect."", ""Dang! This game is amazing! I'm always looking for a good simulator game. This one is perfect! It has many advantages of camera veiws. And it runs smooth for me! I look forward to playing this game a lot"", ""The game is absolutely fantastic in my opinion. The controls, gameplay is just what I expect in a normal truck simulator game. The only problem I have is on one job, where you have to drive up this rocky hill, and my truck can't withstand the height. Despite me having an amazing upgraded truck. Other than that, this game is phenomenal. Good job!"", ""Great game. I'm addicted. Can you please please please change something though? Can you please change the way the game handles gas food and hotels? I always end up crashing because the buy option pops up and didnt let me finish stopping. Its beyond annoying. Make it so you have to get in the spot, put the truck in park, and turn it off and then you have the option to buy. I will instantly turn this review into 5 stars. I've already more money than I usually do on this game lol. I love it."", 'It is a really fun game but after you play it it will get annoying when you hear the noise of the engine all the time if they will fix it and make it the players choice to hear the engine or not it would be amazing and get 5 stars', 'So enjoyable gameüíì though it is very hard to play because of reverse turning backward not like of other vehicles but as like I said it is very enjoyable game because it is challenging üíìüíìüíìüíìüíì', 'Best of the truck simmulators but with many small faults. Stop light goes directly from green to red so running over a green light will still get you a fine. The buttons are not sensitive enough so if you dont press exactly in the middle they dont respond. The cuise control does not have resume so it resets after being switched off. Bugs with buying paints en wheels that dont get selected when pressing select button. Number plate buys dont stay on the plate. Please add ingame bug report option', ""Yes, it's a great game anyway, but my little question is at what point does one engage in time cheat? Help me because I have been dropped from level 5 to the least level severally on the account of time cheat, which I hardly understand it. In fact, it's really painful when you spend much time to gather much money in the game but all of a sudden, you are, ripped off all you get."", ""I liked it but when you park you can't reverse in. . I would play it if you update the game .you also have to look at the timer and you have like 10 mints to travel about 35 km."", 'Well ...the game is great no doubt. But it lacks some basic things like,,, at night sun appears, rain drop on winshield when the truck is under tunnel, signal dosent go to green in some areas, some vehicles dosent move from the toll road gate. And mostly for sleeping, please allow option for a driver to sleep on the truck by parking on side road, instead of renting a room.']"

The snow is supposed to be on just one side of the valley but instead the bug makes it either on both or neither inconsistently. It's super annoying. Please fix!!"", ""I really like the game and I'm almost in it, but it's so difficult once i have reached 26th level, because I'm facing problem with layout options...i suggest to upgrade with new layout options which enables players to move around the things, when they got new ideas about the positioning and layouts of buildings and other items"", 'This game would be a lot of fun if it didn\'t waste so much of your time. It\'s designed to force you to spend money. They have a ""market"" to get items you need but the algorithms in the game make the market RARELY show you items you are in need of. You have to select random items then travel to that person\'s local market to see if they may have the item you actually need. And if you do find an item you need but lack something, you can\'t travel back to that place. Fun if markets were searchable.', ""If you are VERY patient, you will really enjoy this game. It has enough items to keep you busy once you build up a bit. My only complaint is with the Global Trade HQ. There should be some way to limit what items show up for sale, otherwise as you progress there begins to be too little chance of getting what you need thus after awhile you are spending SO MUCH time there that the game loses it's fun factor. If you had to pick 15 or so items even if unavailable you wouldn't waste so much time."", ""I love this game. The only reason I haven't given it 5 stars is because every once in a while the game will freeze, but the aduio keeps playing. Closing the game doesn't work as I still hear the audio and if I try to re-open it, it just gives me a white screen. The only thing that fixes it is going into the settings on my phone and forcing the app to stop."", 'The game is really well thought out and amazingly detailed , only problem being the trademark EA move of unrealistically pricing certain building and the availability of certain materials to slowdown the progress of a good player so that the consequent vexation with the snail pace of earning simloens would make then pump the money , but in many cases it makes most of the folks quit the game', ""Great game and amazing graphics. But after a while it becomes a daily login kinda game. There's nothing to do but wait for materials to craft. The only thing to do is upgrade a building once every login then wait for materials again. Wish they'd be a bit more innovative in ways to earn coins or craft materials instead of the wait or pay real money to speed it up."", 'Its a great game but I wish in the Global Trade you can search what you are looking for. For example, if you are looking for a specific products its a hassle because you need to refresh until you found what you are looking for. So yeah its a great game but I wish there was a feature where you can search for a specific product in global trade.', 'The game becomes very slow once you reach higher levels, because upgrades, shipments, challenges, etc, require greater numbers of more complex resources to complete, unless you are prepared to pay real money for in-game cash. Too many of the challenges in ""Mayor\'s Challenge"" are war related and they have now added ridiculous monster attacks on your city.', 'It definitely has potential. However, the gameplay in the long run really SUCKS LIKE A LOT. You never seem to get what you are looking for ALL the time. It is a cheesy and stupid method to get you to spend real money. It is just dumb really dumb. I hate this game!!!', 'Fun game, but abandons the Sim ethos by being freemium and having war as a central component. I would gladly pay $40-50 one time, instead of missing out of parts of the game that cost a couple bucks and have no permanence. I love creating cities, completing tasks, unlocking items and features, classic SIM. But war and pay to play are a huge bummer. Great graphics,tho I would also point out that the screen is cluttered and hard to navigate as a result.', ""I love this game. It's very immersive and engaging, although others are right that growth is slow if you don't spend real money. However, I am docking a star because there is a new bug that is driving me nuts. Occasionally when I'm in someone else's city, the game will suddenly freeze. If I quit it, a blank notification comes up and will not swipe away. If I reopen it, the notification goes away, but the game is just a blank white screen. It's happened 5 times in the last week and 4 of those times, I've had to restart my phone (stock Pixel 4) to get it to stop. The other time, opening the Play store fixed it, but I have no idea why since that didn't work when I tried it just now. Hopefully this gets fixed soon because it's very annoying to have to restart my entire phone! But otherwise I do love this game and will definitely increase my rating to 5 stars once this is resolved."", ""The game is pretty neat, has that great old Simcity feeling. But come on guys! The market (Global Trade HQ) is totally rigged beyond redemption! Whatever resource you need will not show on the market, or only if your storage is only 1, then it will show 2 or more, to force you to spend money to get it. You only see restricted number of item slots, 60+% with the same items you don't need. You can't filter or or bookmark favorite trading partners. It's so obviously about paying real money, sad!"", ""First off, it would be a pretty good game if it weren't so expensive üôÑ ALSO I finished a challenge and it didn't give me my green diamond things üò° really pissed me off cuz it was alot. And I also wish there were an easier way to get war items! Please make it easier, thank you"", 'It\'s a cool game but what I dont like is that as soon as you level up and unlock like the hospital stuff or whatever the sims will start to be like ""I\'m going to die"" or ""I need to get to the hospital"" but they dont say what I said but could EA fix that or something but it\'s still a good game I play it every day well not every day', ""I like the game but why do the updates get stuck on 99% for days? It's very annoying. 3 days and counting, at this rate i am going to be deleting it again and moving on to something else. Another forced update and another lockout, can't you just send a notification. Auto update is not working reliably and taking days to do an update is seriously annoying. 4 days and counting this time, the updates are getting worse and worse for installation.

I got to the 6th level and didn't really come across any paywalls or anything but it does slow down a fair bit. Really like the graphic style and it's also really addictive to play. Definitely recommend it to kill some time :)"", 'I clucking love this game! I play it all the time. I especially love the funny newspaper drops like ""the New Yolk times"". There are hardly any ads besides when you want an ad for money or golden eggs. I highly recommend this game to anyone reading this review!!!', ""I honestly love the game. I saw it from my friends and at first I thought it was overhyped but it is pretty fun, definitely one of the best idle games I've played. One of the best things about is is the fact that I haven't come across any paywalls and all the ads I've seen have been optional. Another great thing is the progression. I feel like I'm always achieving some goal but it doesn't feel too easy. Overall a great game and a great way to kill some time."", ""If you love idle ticker games, this is for you. I'm horribly addicted to these types of games, ones that require no skill and reward you for arbitrarily tapping the right buttons, and this one keeps pulling me back in. Daily rewards, multiplier bonuses, incremental reward structure, this game has it all. adVenture Capitalist needs to take note. The chicken animations are great and seeing your purchases in action is a great touch. Great little game."", ""I really don't know where to start, this game is amazing. The graphics are perfect just what you would want from any game, the controls are smooth and satisfying. But the gameplay while still really fun becomes a bit dull, it's pretty repetitive but when you get the new upgrade or egg you feel amazing 8/10 highly reccomend"", ""The game is awesome, has quite awesome graphics and gameplay. It's also very stable and does not imply that if you have money you win the game.The anticheat system is very good to be exact too good even time cheats don't work. It's just a great game and hope that more updates come up soon cuz I'm waiting for more. Keep it up"", 'Fun for the first few farms, after the quantum egg farm it starts to get repetitive, log on, upgrade a few things, hatch more chicken, let the money build up, also, a suggestion for silos, instead of only allowing two without the permit, add 2 extra, but they must be bought with golden eggs (edit) changed to three stars after not recieving review bonus', ""It's a good game, but gameplay slows done A LOT the higher up you progress. Not to mention with the latest update, you need money to advance otherwise you'll be grinding for years. I'm also unable to join co-ops now. The game won't let me type a private co-op name into the Co-Op entry space. I shouldn't have to download a keyboard app to utilize a feature of the game."", ""Used to enjoy the game, contract farms added something a little extra to keep things interesting. But latest changes have ruined them, it used to be challenging but possible to complete contracts. It now seems impossible, no point trying them anymore. And that was the only thing bring me back on so I think it's time to hang up my chicken farming boots. So my 9 million golden eggs will go to waste... which I also can no longer use on contracts... game ruined."", ""Thoughtfully engaging and entertaining. It's definitely a great game for those down times you want to be entertained or if you want to be more engaged it gives you that option as well. The co-op missions are fun but hard to do without a good team involved. Hopefully that will be further enhanced later on. If you run the co-op it does give the option to remove inactives over 24 hours. I don't find a great reason yet to purchase the permit even though I have it besides the extra time for the silos"", ""I love this game. Have for years. However, I have an idea. What if you were to implement a system for people to sell boosts for Golden Eggs. I don't normally like the contracts until way later, so I have a bunch of Soul Mirrors going unused. I propose that we should be able to sell our unused boosts for either 50% or 75% of how much they cost in the Boost Shop."", ""Still really love this game, I play it literally everyday or check in at least. Though, whatever updates have happened, it's constantly popping up with messages saying I've been booted from co op (even when I've created the group and can't be booted) or I've cheated with time restrictions or something. Please help creator! I think it might have something to do with swapping from my phone data to my WiFi when I get home? I swear I'm not cheating! üò¢"", 'I love this game, this is the only mobile game that I play anymore ever since I discovered it. The games for me is pretty laggy, but thats because of my phone, and the Golden Egg prices are pretty steep, but this game makes me want to grind it out and get make as many eggs as possible and get as much money from those eggs along with it. Great game, cant put it down.', ""Very fun. Can get a bit boring sometimes but it's a great time killer. Would recommend. I must also praise you for having very few adverts, it's one of the best motivations in my opinion to keep playing. Because you can actually play the game when you want and aren't bombarded with ads all the time. Time and effort is very present in this game with a polished and slick GUI that looks incredible for a free game. Keep working on it, this game will do great!"", ""Really fun. Great way to pass the time. All prices for buying things seem fair. Really love the drone idea for getting golden eggs and money. Watching videos for bigger quantities of those items is a good idea. No pop ups. Everything works great. Controls are clear. And the little newspaper articles you get are pretty entertaining, help break up the gameplay so you're not just watching chickens run around. Highly recommend!! üëçüëç"", 'It\'s fun and a great time waster, but as you move through the eggs, progress slows down immensely, such to the point where not even leaving the game for 16 hours gets you enough money for a single upgrade and it takes months just to DISCOVER the next egg. I really want to keep playing but it is getting really hard when nothing new ever happens besides a contract here and there (which for some reason are all rated ""IMPOSSIBLE""). I don\'t want to prestige either. It\'ll take months to get back again', 'Great to play on your own, but playing the Co-op is frustrating because it is almost impossible to get any of the contracts completed. And that\'s with going on multiple times a day and having 16 people doing the same. Needs to be a lot easier to complete. I\'ve given up on the ""Contract Egg"" portion altogether because it\'s a waste of resources', ""I love this game and have had it on my phone for years now. I initially wasn't keen on boost restructuring but I don't mind it so much now. I am a fan however of paying like 7.00$ any now and again to get like 200000 eggs. You're able to play the game easily without access to the piggy bank. The graphics are great. I just rly like this game and the co-op feature is awesome. Would be nice to be able to exit co-ops to ditch inactive ones."", ""I really enjoy this game, it's pretty addicting. One thing though, please fix the ads. I have to hit the X in just the right place on the screen, otherwise I get flung into Google play. When returning to the app, I almost always don't get credit for my time. That is unacceptable."", ""One of the better idle games. You're able to get a TON of upgrades for your egg. It's somehow futuristic and modern at the same time, and there's no forced ads! Surprising considering how many games have ads every 10 seconds. The only miss in this game is the piggy bank. I don't get why you need to pay 5 dollars for something you technically already own. Doesn't make sense to me. Anyway a great game. 5 stars."", ""Glorified ad simulator. Still, the hook of advancing and managing is engaging, for at least a small time frame. Eventually you realize the ONLY way to advance is to watch ads or pay for the optional micro transactions. This game doesn't reward skill, or even perserverance. You will only advance be watching ads (small progress) or paying real money. Had a lot of fun in the beginning, lots of potential, but eventually realized I was waiting to watch ads 99% of the time. Oh well."", 'Its pretty good for the fact that its just a tapping game. I would deffinitly tell people about and what great about it is that other tapping games where you build your place or uprgade it you would have to wait 1000 hours (exageration) for it to upgrade. In this game you just tap with the money you have and boom you have your upgrades.', 'Extremely simple gameplay. Each type of farm looks identical with no expanding buildings to make except when you research. I have not finished all different types of farms and I definitely have not finished all research. Chickens look the same regardless. Definitely a spam tap a button to progress as the main thing game.', 'After a while of using it I can say that it is an excellent game. I would like it for some enhancements for watching the ads for boosts as well as money and golden eggs. If you are looking to use your time for some relaxation and downtime this is definately the game for you!', 'Fantastic game! Can be played without spending money on MTX but it does not hurt to support this developer! This game is like most games that offer MTX; purely to make you reach goals faster but again, all activities and unlockable eggs in this game can be attained without spending a single quarter! Support these guys! They know how to make a solid idling game. If the developer sees this, keep up with this! It definitely keeps me coming back and I definitely will spend to support when I can!', ""This game operates well and exactly as they say it will. I have run across precious few bugs, none of them remotely serious (usually requires merely closing and reopening a menu). Slow starter, ofc, but you can eventually do research that will allow you to hatch more chickens when you're offline than online, and contracts to complete (usually with groups of people). Good stuff. You'll hear complaints about the cost of golden eggs, but they also trickle in free from random events while online."", 'Egg, Inc. has been an amazing game for me to melt away boring hours. Playing the game gives me a level of instinctual comfort, with its simple graphics and endearing music. The controls are easy to learn, and the gameplay loop fails to feel like a grind. Egg, Inc. Is a wonderfully simple game, playing it gives me the same nostalgiac feeling as wrapping myself in warm blankets, as I watch virtual chickens run across my screen. Tl;dr: Play this game', ""I hesitated to get this game for a while, but it's one of the best idle/clicker games I've ever tried (and I don't normally like those kinds of games to begin with). The only problem I have with it is that your progress slows down drastically after the first couple of months of playing."", ""Last few updates have ruined the game once you've hit the last couple eggs. Contracts are impossible now, devs apparently dont know what Very Easy means, and the newest token timer is a load of BS. Congrats folks, you've taken all the fun out of an engaging time waster. Also, raising the prices of things while lowering your accrual values isnt helping either. Even with 48 prophecy eggs and 250 Trillion soul eggs, you can't do anything to advance. Game sucks now."", ""Scarily addictive. Breaking the bank is one of the smartest micro transactions I've seen to date, gives a very good implied value to the premium currency vs the traditional options. Props to the devs for finding a way to milk the whales in the fairest way possible. Great gameplay for people that like the long haul, prestige system and epic research leads in to a very well designed progress flow. If you hit a roadblock, prestiging will more often than not help you pass, no micros needed."", ""For a boring, basic game it is addictive! You can upgrade hen houses, vehicles, research centre and farm, disappointed you can't upgrade the chickens. The screen moves with one finger so tapping the drones is annoying if they fly through a hen house ect as this opens up the upgrade part or moves the screen . . . . 2 finger movement would be better so you can lock the layout of your farm view. The ads aren't bad, you will find yourself needing to watch them to earn cash rewards for upgrades."", ""Quick summary of game: You get an egg, get upgraded, get better eggs, and once it's hard to reach the next egg, you prestige. Prestige gives soul eggs which multiplies accumulation. You'll also reach eggs of prophecies, which multiplies accumulation from the soul eggs. I have over 7 billion soul eggs and 10 eggs of prophecies, earning over 500 billion%. I've been stuck on the same egg for MONTHS. The difficulty curve is insane, and prestiging is worthless. A time waster that doesnt last strong."", ""An Intertaining Mobile game. Of course it has its set-back's and issues, but still enjoyable. Plus the developers are active so Plus there. The games looks could use some TLC for sure and maybe add some additional features?!? (But I don't think the game was meant to be to in-depth) But all-round a descent FREE game that has hours of playability."", ""Being a simple chicken has been my dream and this game makes it possible, also once I stubbed my toe on my chair and it really hurt and I think I broke it and I walked on it for about a week and realized that hey it's broken and I need to tape them together before it gets worse, then I did. They feel better now but you know how toes. Anyway I like Starburts."", ""Could be easier to fill your farm with chickens. Every time you buy a new Farm you have to start over and it's hard to get to the goals. Also it's frustrating that they place an internal clock on the game. So now you can't jump back when you've missed an opportunity"", ""The pace slows drastically with each new egg, but once you unlock trophies they provide a nice goal to work on. I like that each one takes a couple of days; just dropping in every few hours. It's just gives me something to focus my hectic mind and helps me relax."", ""Thus game is pretty good When u get the hang of it, after the 2 or 3 farm u will be a pro at it, I obviously got this cause I have chickens of my own, but it's actually fun and it has different styles of everything, it doesn't spam u with adds unless u want to earn something, it's fun, easy, and interesting! Try it!!!"", 'Have had the game for a couple years now, since before they even added the boosters. Kind of irritating that you use the boosters they give you only to have the leaders of the co ops kick you out for cheating because you found an excellent way to use the boosters and for the game to call it cheating', ""Rather addictive, but also easy to stop when you need. You only see ads when you choose to get worthwhile bonuses. They're nicely integrated into the gameplay. I find myself able to spend 5 minutes or 2 hours, without getting bored."", ""It seems that once you reach a certain point in the game, things start to plateau. I'm at 7 golden eggs with over 30B soul eggs and each month nowadays it looks like the calendars are the same. One day per month, it'll give me 1B soul eggs which is still nice and all but it's starting to make a smaller difference each time. I've reached A.I. level but it takes me roughly a full week to get back up to A.I. after prestiging.""]"

Easy solution stop being paid by tapjoy to advertise in your game and award a few gems for daily log in."", 'Great game...some disappointment with so little reward for leveling. Brings to mind the expression ""so much for so little"" leaves a funny feeling of I did a lot but that is what they value it at. Seems incompatible with the effort.', 'Only issue I have is the money intake takes ages and some things are so expensive like extra worker slot 200k ...is a bit much as it take ages to get the mo eye for that other thi g is I buy awsome gear then after a time it breaks and gotta use gems to repair it when should have the option to use money to repair like shop titans does....I bought the pack that got awsome weapons now they all broke and my characters are piss weak again fix these issues and I think this will be awsome game', ""Delightful game with very nice customer support. I wanted to link my phone and Steam accounts so i could play away from my computer, and they got that sorted in no time flat. This game's a fabulous and addictive way to pass the time!"", ""Pretty fast replies for account linking tickets. Left game cause it was pretty addictive but recently picked it up again and it hasn't lost its shine. Sure progress gets slower as you progress, but that applies to every game xD It's fun playing shop keeper."", ""An interesting find I had first started playing on steam and hadn't been able to get back on it till I got a smart phone so it's always great to play a game like this that teaches you how to multitask and manage your money and the like"", ""It is buggy. The timer for the crafting action suddenly stops and I can't seem to sell a product that I have already crafted. Buttons don't respond, and I am forced to exit the game and come back to return it to normal."", ""The game itself is fine, however some buttons stop working after a while and it messes with my phone's wallpaper, causing me to fix it each time I play."", 'This game is awesome! No need to spend money to enjoy. Love the crafting and leveling system', ""My new phone couldn't transfer my data so I asked for help and I got the problem fixed. Nothing got lost in my account and the game is also very fun"", ""First played years ago on Kongregate and loved it. One of the best time management games I've played and love the RPG elements"", ""Its been one week already but i dont know what happen until now i can't craft my things so i stop playing, crafting button dissapear all of them.hope it will be fix as soon as possible. ."", 'Fun, addictive, and full of friendly players.', 'Great game, however last update made all my crafting slots disappear making the game unplayable.', 'Its fun becuse you can build lots of things amd its not like you have to attack and you can join or create a city.', 'A relaxing game and I enjoy building the items that my customers need.', 'just want to say thank you to the technical suppoort team, finally the game get back to normal.', 'since the new update, I lost 6 of my crafting stations, I only have 3 now. Any help', ""I'm having trouble leaving this game alone. The simple concept of make and sell , planning what to make next , so you can unlock more goods , all make this game a joy to play. Allowing for time difference between countries, support was very good and helpful as well, looking forward to more happy trading, good work."", 'I really enjoy this game! The characters are nice to look at with all their unique personalities and the city events are great! I greatly enjoy unlocking new blueprints, I feel a sense of accomplishment with each new one I unlock! While you can use real money to get new blueprints, no type of blueprint is stuck behind a paywall, and the customer service is excellent!', ""Quite the grind for free to play, little value in $$$. I like games where I can try for free and pay a small amount if the game suits me. Like for example sky force . Free to play, and $2 makes the game far less of a grind, permanently... I'm not against paying to play, but I'm also not gonna spend $10 a month on a dinky game. Netflix barely charges that and they don't have ads or timers making me wait..."", ""Well this update is a fail. Since updating tonight (31/10/2019) all the item icons have vanished, half the hero avatars are gone, and it crashes when I try to go to the inn or town. Others in my town are having similar issues. Looks like I'm out until it gets fixed, if it gets fixed. We lost a few members a couple of updates ago when an update bored them and they gave up waiting. Fingers crossed they fix this before we lose to many more."", 'Game has been stablished for a while, pretty stable by now, so instead of charging for items on the store they should have an option for equiping your hero with the best available items with a quick one tap button, or the ability to buy upgrades like the gigant or Jack with diamonds instead of actual money.', ""Good game, but definitely don't believe the bs percentages in crafting probability and break probability. 75% chance to craft and it can fail 6 times in a row; 1% chance to break n get breakages almost every mission lol. Otherwise game is good tho, can earn diamonds without paying n get a lot of time n value out of it."", 'I cannot connect to Kongregate account', ""I've been playing this for years now and it's still gets me hooked! A problem, though is that I need to log-out and re-log in my kongregate account everytime I want to play this on my phone. Hope this gets fixed for a more seamless experience."", ""Current update still hasn't fixed the horrendous issues inside the trade house, until this is fixed it makes it hard for new players to recieve decent donations meaning to advance quickly and have their own city they would be better off purchasing in app packages which are ridiculously expensive. until the trade house issues are resolved this game remains a one star and not worth downloading. Problem still not solved by new update. So hope new players like spending over $20 on packages."", ""I've played both of these shop games, and the Titans has an easier interface."", ""Game is great fun if the cost of healing and packages were lower, especially as a benefit for buying monthly gem packages it would be awesome, some of us live on fixed social security and want to be able to buy stuff just can't afford it"", 'The game is great, only problem is that its heavily pay to win, everything in the game is super expensive and forces yoy to buy thwor gems wih money which are still too expensive than most games', 'Every game mechanic is well thought and made long term interesting, and not with forced p2w. Game devs care and its the best shop tycoon on markets. Its a game that takes your soul the moment you give it a chance.', 'I was having a couple issues and the customer servive was right on top of it. The game is fun and beautiful. Keep up the amazing work', ""Good game, but it's been 2 days since I couldn't connect to server with 1006 error. I'm done. Edit: issue fixed after update"", 'One of the beat of its kind Has the negatives of a mobile game, like microtransactions, but overall a good game!', 'Awesome images and plenty of things to craft to keep a player interested.']"

Check out these exciting new updates:

- General game improvements & optimization.","[""Some levels are really hard to get past, but that just makes that gameplay all the better. What I really loved was that, when a mistake concerning some crystals I had purchased was made, it was easy to contact support and my issue was resolved in less than 24 hours. They were super kind about it and didn't give me the run-around like a few other apps I used to have."", 'I really like the art style and game play of this app, but I think it would be a lot more enjoyable without the energy system. I would definately add a star if it was taken out. I also think that having a few more levels in each area or reducing the requirements of the land quests would make them feel less grindy.', ""I have been playing this game for a long time, it's my fav baking game, it's definitely the type of game you have to stay active with to win, i love it! there's no inappropriate content like other games, But it can be a hard to win game for young ages, other than that I recommend this game if this is the type of stuff you like! It has some what difficult challenges in it, but what's a game without competition, challenges, & goals right? üç∞üíú"", ""The game screen is zoomed in for all new smartphones and edges seem cut off. You can't see the patience level of any customers. In Confection Cascade, you won't be able to decorate or serve because the equipment is out of screen. The game is very engaging and fun and would rate higher if you fix these issues. You will lose out on all players since not everyone will want to log into a PC to play a game. All of us play games on the go or when waiting etc"", 'I really enjoy this game except for the fact that it either crashes alot or cant get rewards from watching videos. Otherwise the concept, art style and playing mechanics are exactly what I was looking for. FYI i would totally pay for this if it were like a subscription(unlimited lives etc)since every level seems so extensive and im continually excited for new recipes. Maybe even a console game? If you could get enough popularity for it', 'I really do like this game. I dont like the fact though that when I switched phones I lost all of my gems. For the people that are having issues with it being too zoomed in on the phone and not being able to click the decorating items, it took me awhile but you can change the settings in your phone to fix this issue', 'Could be better if they will fix the screen. It doesnt properly fit the screen of my phone. Im using huawei p30 pro. There are some icons that only shows 1/8 of itself, i have to click on it multiple times. It takes time. But the game is great and graphics are cute i love it.', ""I really like this game , but the game screen doesn't seem to be compatible with my Samsung a50. The icing and decorations are off the screen slightly ,making it harder to press the correct ingredients"", 'graphics are beautiful!! ive played this game on and off for years and got pretty far on a different account. the only problem is, sometimes when i get to a level, i press play and the screen just goes dull and stays on the map. i cant get to the level. this happened before on a different device and account. maybe its just my bad luck with technology, but it gets annoying.', ""I used to LOVE playing this game. But when I upgraded to my Samsung S10+ the game zooms in on the screen size and doesn't allow me to touch the the decorative items in the game play. When you try to touch the cake pan the pause button is displayed slightly over it and pauses everytime I try to even start the game play. Super disappointed. This was my favorite game."", ""I'm giving it three stars because I really like the game but my issue it lags very badly every time I try to play I start and then it'll freeze and I'll have to restart the game as I said I really like the game but can't play may have to uninstall"", ""Loading screen takes forever, and game can be laggy. Additionally, it runs fullscreen on my Samsung S8+, which isn't at all horrible but it's so zoomed in that it gets cut off on the edges, making it more difficult to click things in the sides during gameplay. I was addicted to this game years ago but uninstalled due to loading issues. I picked it up again, now that I got a new phone, but it seems like the original issue was never resolved. Uninstalling again"", 'Never gives you lives after watching videos like it is supposed to. Also I have paid for crystals but never recieved them. Twice this has happened. So i will never be buying anything in this game again.', ""Leading the app or a level takes forever. There's an option to watch a video and get 3 energy. I watched 3 videos, and I got none. Upgrades cost so much and you earn so little, this is probably a ploy to get you to spend more (real) money. The game could be better."", ""I have emailed several times nowconcerning the issue that I keep losing my medals and I haven't even gotten to play a level already I have lost two metals for the spooky spectacular going on in the bakery game and yet to metals are gone and I haven't played anything yet.I don't think that you should be charging money for a game if you can't get your glitches fixed. I would appreciate immediate attention to this issue."", 'New phone has this game in full screen mode, but that means certain parts of the game are no longer accessible as they fall off the full screen. Please amend!', ""There seems to be a problem when I play the first stage for Fruitful Fields, when the game starts and I want to make the products it doesn't respond and no action takes place but the game doesn't freeze and the time just continues and it also consumes my energy :-(( please fixxx"", ""Still stopped on Bakery Blitz, Panna cotta cliffs 145. You say you have helped but it's still not working and my computer is not the problem.!!!"", ""Love the art style and story telling in this game very cute. I've noticed that I'll be on the loading starting screen for 5-10 minutes then once I'm in it another cake stacking of death loading screen for a level that I want to replay or navigate to a different map."", ""Horrible this app use to be better. I purchased a special and it didn't even load to my account. I had to restart my phone several times. When playing it's glitching and why do you have the pause button right there where you have to put the cake in the oven? Uninstalled."", ""I do not like that you have to wait until your energy is full to play a level if you run out, also they do not give enough customers to complete goals, and you have to use crystals to get necessary upgrades. It can be a great game if it wasn't so stingy."", 'I cant get any further in the game past cascade confection bc the screen resolution is off on my phone, please fix the app i cant play because of the location of the candy machines on the screen. There isnt anywhere to click.', 'Very fun and challenging game, energy takes a really long time to generate though', ""Game is good but takes money. If you buy coins or gem there is no guarantee you will receive them. This is the 5th time I've purchased gems for 3.99 and havent received them. I'm deleting app."", ""I really enjoy the game,but I'm having trouble getting my energy after I watch the ads. Please fix it then I'll give you a 5 star rating,thank you."", 'Its been 5 months since I got a reply and I just recently upgraded my phone to an s10 yesterday and the game screen being too big on my phone screen STILL exist even on my s8 the week earlier and now my s10 today.', ""Pretty cool game but it keeps freezing on me I have a galaxy 10s plus that I play it on please fix! That's my only concern for now."", 'I like this game but the only problem i have with playing game is everytime i go to a level it freezes and it just stays on the map', ""I was hoping after finally being able to update the game that it would fit the screen on my Samsung Galaxy S8 so I could play it, but it still doesn't. Still can't put things down on the bottom of the screen"", ""Good game but I have watched videos to earn energy and every time it says something went wrong so I wasted my time it's very irritating"", ""This is a game which is very fun and it gets harder and it's best for people who loves baking"", 'The rewards are not coming for energy rewards and it KEEPS SAYING ERROR FOR REWARDS. then it claims to ask to buy a bundle for energy.

The fashion cup is just horrible. I got 10 tickets one day so I used it all that day and now they are not giving me any tickets only and now I have many tasks to shoot a movie do I have all the things I just have to get another body skill so I go to the gym but I cannot do anything if I press the dumbels or anything it just shows how I need to complete . So please take my advice and don't waste your time downloading this app.üòìüòì"", 'I was pretty happy playing this game until 11/26/2019 A new update was installed through google play and the game froze up several times then for some reason i started all over as a newbie in Harlem.

Story lines are uninspired or just plain stupid at times. Need more locations to visit.', 'I love this game the only reason im not giving it 5 stars is because im almost on level 42 and all their is to do is level up on lucky slots to level 30 im only level 12 thats gonna take about a month i dont have that many tokens and to play fashion cup however i cant do that if theres small changes being made to it although if i had more missions to do that would be great because at the moment theres no missions so its a bit boring x', ""It took a long time to download. But it is an amazing game and it's fair you dont have to buy money or diamonds. Just the prices are really high but if you want to be a star you have to be rich while being one so I get it. Other than that I love it"", 'I like this game but this game thinks we have all the money in the world to buy fricking diamonds. Try making the dresses more cheaper so everyone can buy the dress they want. I still have the game but try to improve on your graphics', ""I like it but I hate that all the clothes have to have diamonds to buy them then that stupid fashion police when playing that fan gifts maybe if I was rich enough to spend that kind of money to have lots of diamonds then I wouldn't have a problem hard to find a good game to enjoy when waiting for a doctor's appointment or when your vehicle is being worked on or traveling by plane."", 'i love it because you get to be a celebrity and there is so much fun you can have like buying a new house or shopping for more clothing/accessories.

The only thing I would suggest would be to add a pause button, so you can go to bed at a reasonable time without having to worry that you are going to run our of quest time.', ""This game is fun and the story line grows more and more intense. However, some of the mechanics don't make sense. On Fashion Street, what is the point of the cards? If you are still going to charge jewels for the clothes, then the cards serve no purpose. I understand game developers need the cash to help grow, but this game is really, really getting money hungry. I still haven't gotten my 15 diamonds for downloading and playing My Story, which you offer through this game."", 'I absolutely love this game. I am sooo addicted to this game!!! I play it every day and several times throughout the day. This game is sooo much fun and if you give it a try you will love it too.', ""If you're reading this review before downloading, save your time and money. No matter how many diamonds you buy you'll still have to shell out more money to get to the next challenge. The Fashion Cup is beyond unfair, to make clothes costs more than you win...IF you win, you'll duel with someone with triple the points you have and never have a chance to win. Overall this is nothing more than a greedy app and greedy app makers. Used to think the game was fun, but no more. Greedy!!!"", ""Would offer a four or five star rating but everything costs so many diamonds and those diamonds cost money. Since the items that cost diamonds are truly the only way to win in the Arena, it's becoming rather frustrating. The storylines are fun, the fashions and makeovers are fun, but it's not a game for those who don't want to spend money on entertainment gaming."", ""I love the game but hate that it'd quit giving me chances to watch videos for diamonds not all of us can afford to buy them and now just about all the clothes are diamonds you don't hardly get them from games or searching"", ""It's an okay game the story the lines are cool but there's a lot of talking I wouldn't reckon you get this game."", ""Like the game but clothes and accessories to win duals are.

I just started playing a while ago and as I started playing, it seamed fairly easy and it was fun. Then it started getting difficult, you run out of gems and money really fast and you are expected to buy super expensive things and you get a small reward in cash compared to what you just bought. Also, you run out of energy way too fast, you have to wait exessive periods of time to get your energy back. Also, quests are so hard to complete.', ""Frustrating, moving through this game is verrrry slow with lots of pauses while waiting for energy to refill. Clothes such as couture dresses cost a crazy amount of diamonds - and I never did get my 15 diamonds for downloading/playing the My Story game. Not that 15 diamonds would make a big difference anyway since you need hundreds of them to buy the dresses (I currently have 8 üòÇ). I guess you need to spend $$$ in order to get anywhere but honestly I'm not that invested yet."", 'I have complained more than 10 times but my problem is always ignored....i have no missions now,when is the fashion cup ready to be played,,i hate this dalay', ""I love this game, but the prices are so high and its impossible to buy anything and the game basicially forces you to spend your cash and you have to buy everything with diamonds and it is very hard to earn cash. Also I dont like the fact that you need energy because that just wastes your time because you have to sit there and wait to get energy. If I had to give my advise I would say 1st CHEAPER items!!! 2nd Start off everday with like 10 diamonds and 3rd Don't work with energy, Thank you"", ""It's a nice game to keep me preoccupied. Downfalls everything costs way too much, I have been playing the game for a little over a week now and won't even go into how much I spent, just to get gems. Energy takes way too long to build up. Some tasks I have done, but they still remain. In the fashion arena, beginner level is easy, the intern level is extremely difficult to advance, which sucks. And, all my husband does is stand there saying the same things over and over again."", ""It's a cool game, I'm really enjoying it. Although there's a couple of things I hope will improve. First, the energy level goes down too quick and take longer to regain. Secondly, the wardrobes are expensive, it's almost impossible to win stars. Thirdly, items are too expensive. $20,000 for a pair of shoes. In order to keep up with this game, you'll have to spend a lot your real money to play. I see the publishers don't reply to any of the reviews/issues.."", ""If you reach level 20 you won't be able to afford to play as much. Your activities will be decreased. If your poor in real life don't bother with games, to get more popular you will need more gems, which you need to buy. Or cash in game.. Also its increasing its advertisements for no real reason."", 'I love this game! However, I miss being able to win the Diamonds on the slot machine', ""I would have given 5 stars, but I feel like I have reached the end of the road on this game. I have invested alot only to be at a standstill. Fashion Arena is just a way to get me to spend more money, i have completed quest but they are still there as if i haven't, i can go on but you get the point. Dont download its not worth it!!!! Im sad but i have to delete this game!"", ""The Game itself is great! Usually, those fashion games do not keep my attention, but this one nailed it! You can even get easily diamonds and cash so it's fun to play! Bit, there is ONE PROBLEM. I installed and played MY STROY so I can get 15 free diamonds and nothing happened. I feel it is just a hoax. I didn't get any free diamonds."", ""It's really fun u get the chance to explore the life of a typical Hollywood star there are many quests to do so go on start playing already"", ""Absolute rip off!! I downloaded this game and have all the houses and reached A Star staus. I got a new device and now they are saying that they can't transfer my data! The most they can do is restore my purchases if I send them screenshots of my receipts. I was a Star Club member and would purchase extra diamonds so that is over 30 receipts. If you want to keep your data you have to keep the same device. If you do download DO NOT spend your real money!"", ""I'm just so freaking addicted, love love love üíñüíñüíñ I haven't found any problem yet even the ads I'm used to lolz."", ""I love this game!I just started playinh today and im already in Hollywood!!Once you start paying you CAN'T stop playing.I would give this 50 stars if I could.I am most definitely look forward to more updates!The graphics and creativity is amazing!I love how you can get tips and be able to still go into your old apartments after you buy new ones.I love all the stunning gowns and hairstyles,and also the tatoos!I don't know what other drama,fashionable,and entertaining game is better than this!!"", 'Stuff are so expensive in the game. You give a few sale on items. I love the game,but its kind of discouraging when you rarely have options. I love the new fashion duel but wow the points you need to have to buy clothes and the hours you need to wait for an item to be sew,even those prices are high and you barely getting the gems for that. Wow']"

LOST EVERYTHING! Really peeved, especially at the loss of my money. Have never bought in app purchases before, but was having a great time playing... never again.', ""It's great! I can earn gems without having to purchase them to move forward in the game. It's fun and borderline addictive if you enjoy creating and managing villages. Only problem, if you play this game online be prepared, you WILL be assaulted by ads every 30sec and that's no exaggeration!"", ""This nice games. You should try it to kill your time. Offline dud.

Good day to you people reading this. Also. Add fun stuff like pets so something. Why not."", ""REALLY?! Forced ads every 30 seconds?? Can't build quick enough. Always have to move quickly or miss the chance to collect money, smiles and stars from cars moving too fast. Screw you and your idiotic game. Uninstalled in less than 20 minutes. -20 stars!"", ""It's an alright game. How do I permanently stop the videos that pop up once every couple minutes? Some games allow ads to stop permanently with an in app purchase."", ""I enjoy this game. It may take a while to buy land, but you can speed it up and gain money. I've started over a number of times. When I'm stressed i can lose myself in my little town. It was my first build game and helped me when I found others"", ""This is far too time consuming for so very little reward. People have lives and jobs. They seem to forget. The grid itself is also quite limited. Diamond distribution is not too bad (one of few pluses). The current Christmas event is not working. I'm collecting presents and the bar hasn't moved at all. People do like to see progress for their efforts. Who woulda thunk it."", 'Hi! I like your game. Although, there\'s one problem. When I quit the game and decided to watch some videos on youtube, I got back and read a note saying, ""error, failed to extract resources by idk what."" That\'s what it says. I hope you\'re just upgrading the game and hopefully won\'t last until tomorrow. Because I really am hooked on your game. I love it! Please fix it! I\'m looking further to play on it anytime. For now, I\'d give it a three.', ""I like playing games like this. But it takes way to long to upgrade. An it cost way too much to upgrade.

So it is not worth play this games and putting all that time and effort in a game and you just loose it. Rather syick woth the computer games...that is worth the time. I am very dissapointed and angry about this. Other games can restore your progress but not this ones. So sad....... not worth...', 'An all-time favorite. Relaxing, enjoyable. Just working towards that next diamond! And good developers that stay on top of the game. üòÅ', 'Difficult to move objects around on the map. Too many obstructions that can not be moved, making the map choppy and limiting directions of expansion.', ""Good Game but it lacks 360¬∞ turning the game screen....

I do find it hard to expand the screen to where it's comfortable viewing. I don't have perfect vision so being able to make it bigger is important. I find myself squinting even with my eye glasses on."", ""Been looking for a fun mobile game where I'm in control of the outcome. And where you don't have to solve any puzzles to move forward in gameplay! Just wish the theme music would change up a bit. So far no issues for me."", 'This game is TO DIE FOR! For those of you who have not played before,just remember, that you get loads of money and diamonds at the start of the game and you need to save a lot of your money because it is hard to get more as the game progressess. Good luck!', 'Awesome game not much ads but need more opportunities for free diamonds other than that pretty damn good game', ""Relaxing game. Only thing is the land is expensive and accumulating diamonds and cash is hard and takes a lot of time if you can't purchase the diamonds and cash. Where is the Christmas theme?"", ""This is an addictive app, don't get me wrong, but this app is just another money hungry engine. The price for the in-app purchases are a little too exuberant as well, not to mention if you decide to start over your village, and having to rebuy everything again. A great letdown for an app that could've had potential."", 'Building at first was fun but then to expand land or up buildings takes too much effort as you get further into it. I now need over 11,000,000 dollars to expand more land and that is going to take about a week to earn. To achieve what.....more waiting. 4 weeks of fun in this game, that is it. Going to delete after this comment.', ""David: i'm not playing this S.S. version, but i am playing 2 others:Snow Town and Paradise Island. Hang in there. P.I. has been supremely fair from the git-go and i've opened up 7 of 9 islands so far WITHOUT spending one red real cent on fake green dollars or fake gold bars. Love that game"", ""Have been playing this game for awhile now and I'm totally addicted. Great time filler! Although upgrades and land are getting pretty expensive now I'm a higher level (Level 80) Paying for gems has become necessary a few times. Starting to feel an update is needed. I have most buildings at max upgrade so would be nice to see some new buildings etc. Last upgrade was December! Only getting 3 gems when levelling up in disappointing now, it was nice when it unlocked new buildings etc too!"", ""Wow, that was bad! The graphics are nothing impressive, can't zoom in much everything is very tiny, the font size on the text is too small, The tutorial was a joke that didn't show you anything, it just simply popped up getting in my way while I tried to figure out what to tap! Then when I found the house area the idiot camera went down to the bottom of the screen, making me wonder where the flying freck the house I bought was. Had to search for the stupid house. (it was up) Awful!"", ""This is a great city sim. The game doesn't require real money to progress how you want ( just optional). The only downside is how zoomed out it is. On a smaller screen like mine, it would be nice to be able to get a bit closer. Currently, it's hard to place things exactly where you want them. It's not impossible though. Just somewhat inconvenient."", 'Too slow and too limited interms of positioning the buildings.', ""it's really hard to earn cash and hard to get diamonds and the expansion is too expensive. they say it is offline game why so need to top-up? very dissappointing."", 'The game is addictive for me but....I\'m ticked off by the rocks that are thrown back on my purchased land after I pay mucho dinero to dig them up. That bomb on the pictures needs to go too, and just use the bulldozer only to eliminate buildings and all. I\'ve accidently bombed things and have to purchase them again and that starts everything over! üòî I Like the game and it deserves a 5 but.... ""I Cannot!""', ""It's super fun and addictive but it's super hard to save up money to get more land"", 'I was prepared to give 5 Stars until my game conveniently became wiped out. I was on Level 39 and was really enjoying the game so much that I spent over $10 on the game. Two days later, it was like I had never played at all. Deleted all of your games. 2 Stars is being generous after what I just went through. i am thoroughly pissed.', ""It was easy to earn money and diamonds. Although, when I use my mobile phone the screen is too small. Can't clearly see the roads when I build it behind large buildings. Also, it would've been easy if there are some copy/pasting when it comes to building decorations such as the trees instead of manually building it up one by one."", 'I think the game is really fun, been playing for almost a year. Why did all my stuff disappear today?', ""This is really a fun game. I don't like the length of time it takes to build/upgrade buildings but I've found that that's just the way of many of these simulation type games. Many of the prices of construction/upgrading are through the roof so watch your cash supply. Diamonds come pretty quick at first but then start to get scarce so don't be rash with them either. Overall, its a fantastic game and I would recommend it to anyone with spare time."", 'Love it. I get to plan, caculate costs and be creative. Thanks', 'Fun game... Too many ads but overall good concept, love the game!!', 'Looks cool, starts off fun but then everytime you buy property to build it raises the cost of the next land purchase. You save up money and purchase another pice of land and it raises the cost again. Takes forever to get enough money to even purchase anything and even 3x longer to collect jewls which are needed for some of the best buildings! It becomes extremely boring and frustrating!']"

F-Sim Space Shuttle,net.ledinsky.fsim,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.ledinsky.fsim&hl=en&gl=us,"* To celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing, F-Sim Space Shuttle on sale (80% off) for a limited time. *

Have you ever wondered what it‚Äôs like to land the Space Shuttle? Now you can find out. F-Sim Space Shuttle is a critically acclaimed flight simulator for Android smartphones and tablets. It simulates the Space Shuttle approach and landing in incredible detail and accuracy. We‚Äôve tried to combine realistic flight dynamics with stunning graphics and fun game play: Each landing attempt takes just a few minutes. Our landing analysis and scoring system tells you exactly how to improve your next landing. It will make you come back and try again.

Each flight starts at either 10,000 feet, already aligned with the runway, or at up to 50,000 feet, before banking into the heading alignment cone. During descent, the Orbiter is an unpowered glider, so you will only have one chance to get it right. Astronauts used to call it a flying brick: because of its 200,000 lbs. gross weight and low lift over drag ratio, the approach is six times steeper and two times faster than a typical airliner approach. Landing the Orbiter takes practice, but the built-in autopilot demo and tutorials will get you started. After your first safe touchdown,  chase that perfect landing, compare your high scores online with your friends, earn medals, and unlock achievements. Experiment with different weather conditions, night approaches, and even emergency scenarios or system failures. At the end of each flight, watch a replay from different camera angles. 

You control the Orbiter‚Äôs pitch and roll axes by tilting your device. Alternatively, you may switch to on-screen analog sticks. Rudder, speed brake, gear, and chute are usually handled by the autopilot, but you can have full manual control if you like. For beginners, we‚Äôve added rectangles that visualize the desired approach path. Simply try to stay within the corridor of rectangles, and they‚Äôll guide you right to the touchdown point. Advanced pilots can turn them off and rely on the instruments in the head-up display (HUD) instead. The simulated guidance, navigation and control (GNC) systems are authentic replications of their counterparts in the real Orbiter, and the HUD features all the instruments real Space Shuttle commanders used to employ to skillfully land this unique aircraft. Now it‚Äôs your turn to give it a try.

Here‚Äôs what others have said about it:

‚ÄúBecause this app is so visually exciting, so technically deep, so sophisticated, so beautifully done in its realism, effects, and documentation, it earned a perfect 5/5 rating, Outstanding.‚Äù
John Martellaro, Senior Editor for Reviews, The Mac Observer

‚ÄúI was excited to see that I can enjoy flying the space shuttle realistically also on my iPhone and complement my addiction to our Space Shuttle Mission Simulator on PC when I am on the road.‚Äù

Goat Simulator,com.coffeestainstudios.goatsimulator,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.coffeestainstudios.goatsimulator&hl=en&gl=us,"Goat Simulator is the latest in goat simulation technology, bringing next-gen goat simulation to YOU. You no longer have to fantasize about being a goat, your dreams have finally come true!

Gameplay-wise, Goat Simulator is all about causing as much destruction as you possibly can as a goat. It has been compared to an old-school skating game, except instead of being a skater, you're a goat, and instead of doing tricks, you wreck stuff. When it comes to goats, not even the sky is the limit, as you can probably just bug through it and crash the game.

<b>DISCLAIMER</b>
Goat Simulator is a completely stupid game and, to be honest, you should probably spend your money on something else, such as a hula hoop, a pile of bricks, or maybe pool your money together with your friends and buy a real goat.

<b>KEY FEATURES</b>
‚Ä¢ You can be a goat 
‚Ä¢ Get points for wrecking stuff - brag to your friends that you're the alpha goat 
‚Ä¢ MILLIONS OF BUGS! We're only eliminating the crash-bugs, everything else is hilarious and we're keeping it 
‚Ä¢ In-game physics that bug out all the time 
‚Ä¢ Seriously look at that goat's neck 
‚Ä¢ You can be a goat

YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!"", ""This is a really good game and I have a little bit of ads I don't mind but so far I think it is good"", 'It is good üòä but I not really a fan of tilting so could please add a joystick', 'Fun and learning purchases are rather costly', 'Evry time you start a mission the game keeps on saying ""You have crashed mission failed"".I told my son not to play because he keeped geting mad.', 'Very comfortable in playing. Good app', 'Good but could u please add arrow control option', ""It's fun and it's a family friendly game üòÅ"", ""This is the most easiest flight simulator I've ever played. Great game, but I do have some suggestions. I think you should double length of the runways and and create more space on the island. Also, If you can, can you add a breaking system and flaps and other controls? That would make the game much more realistic. Also increase the size of the aircraft carrier so bigger aircraft can operate there. And the causes of crashes are unreasonable. We shouldn't crash just because. Please fix this!"", 'Pretty good. Easy to learn', ""Love it, seriously yo! That said, it's time for you guys to create some new levels. I've been waiting for like forever yo. Also buying planes is way too expensive, I would really like it if I could fly at 35000 feet or even higher, and lastwhy do I keep spinning and getting planes that I already own with the lottery thing. Everything else is perfect."", 'it is a very nice game also it is offline so we can also play without an internet connection. please add that the ship carriers should be more long. I am giving 4 stars because one time I was in free flight mode and I was playing with a Airbus . in my mission each was to land on a ship carrier and each was to transport more than 150 passengers. I got stuck because the wings of my plane were hitting the tower on the carrier. Please fix this.', ""I like the game, but like people said, too many ads. I listen to music all the time when I play and ads pop out of nowhere interrupting my music, then I have to exit game, open Pandora again and back to game. Also, planes WAYYY too expensive and some missions are just impossible. So annoying so I'm uninstalling for now and will look for something close to this."", ""I enjoy the game very much. I gave only 4 stars because new levels were supposed to be coming soon, ever since I started playing. I have completed evey stage and evey level with all 3 Gold stars, and still NO New Levels have been introduced. The game is now becoming stagnate for me, because I don't have any more creative levels to attempt to conquer. Hope you correct this issue soon!"", ""Calibration is off...sight line when landing is terrible, you can't see what's right in front of you at all without diving or climbing a pilots view would be helpful and a recalibration of app in settings would be nice..a report from tower when other planes are in your flight path would be considerate. And where are the cable catches or nets to stop you on air craft carrier...let's be real in emergency rescue missions you can't adjust plane or speed accurately enough to parrel for a rescue....."", 'This game is hard but love this gameüíúüíúüíúüíúüíúüíúüíúüíú', ""Edit: my experience points have stopped accumulating ... bug? A lot of fun with realistic experience (for a phone) and good progression and incentives. My only complaint is the two gliders are only available on Senior rating which is a LONG way up the scale! I would love to try one of these but why so hard to reach. Especially given that many pilots in real life start out on gliders. I'm flying a Leer jet and a 747 but I'm not allowed have a glider???"", 'This game is completely annoying. The physics and flying mechanics are complete rubbish and make no sense. For some strange reason, all airports on land are elevated from the ground. And most of the planes cost real life money, and way overpriced. The adds are horrendously frequent and long, often without a skip button and is a video you have to watch. All this game does is make money for the dev. Not worth playing. Definitely not a real flight simulator.', 'Well put together game. Graphics are not the best, but are plenty for the game scenario. Many great planes available, and alot of levels! The levels, length, and planes paired with the flight experience give this game 5 stars from us. Great game, 6 months total, so now we need more missions and even MORE planes! A+', 'The creators have definitely not made it too difficult to earn in game cash and you can own a variety of planes. A light hearted and yet addictive game. Also not to forget that other than completing missions ,you can also fly in a open world sort of mode taking missions by landing on airports which is kind of fun as well helps you earn game cash.', ""I'm really enjoying this game. There's lots to do and the free flight mode is enjoyable to play. Unlike other apps like this. The free flight mode is rubbish. So why the four stars? Simple really. The in app purchases for better planes are ludicrously priced. No way on Gods earth will I pay extortionate amounts for these planes. Sort this out and I will give five stars. As the rest of the game is great to play."", 'Ex military pilot who loves the attention to detail built into the game. ""I\'ve always wondered if that aircraft was as sluggish as it looks?"" and ""I\'ve always wanted to set a 747 on a carrier!"" Lots of fun, easy to play even if you have zero flight experience! How about some upgrades??? Target practice? Air combat? Having fun killing ballons with a Stealth, but... :)', 'So, heres my thoughts! I really dig this game, but now its time you develope another level? Like how about we go across the ocean and ya have to land on an aircraft carrier for fuel! You only get one chance to land or you run out a fuel. But if you can get fuel, than off to japan you go, huge sky scrapers light up, real cool view, but now you have to land at the airport and because of only being the only port to land at its very busy, so you may have to circle around a few times lol. I rite code', ""Love the game, only one problem, the last level is not out , and I don't think it's ever going to be out, but if it does come out, the developers should add some more planes like Concorde or the A380. Otherwise I really recommend the game to anyone who wants to be entertained for hours. The ads are short and most often, you can skip them . If you're getting overloaded by ads, just turn of your internet."", 'Concept is great but they ruined it with the ads and this gold digger algorithm. From time to time you get discounts on expensive planes that you ""surprisingly"" cannot afford tripping many players into buying coins. If you have chossen not to, then you can farm hours upon hours to buy the same plane just to be able to continue playing the game. Ex. I got offered a jet for 280k i only had 265k i skipped, and now its 660k and the best mission gives 12k. So 2h of farming? Prices are also f up.', ""Flight pilot simulator 3d is a great game, no doubt about it. However, I've been having issues with one specific plane. Whenever I select the cargo 415, and hit play, it spawns me at a seaplane dock and says I crashed. I even tried re loading the game. Is this a very common glitch? If so, can you fix it? Other than that, I've had zero problems with this game, and I really enjoy playing it"", 'This game has crystal clear graphics and is realistic like the braking and speeds and the controls are the most comfortable that I have ever used but there is one mode that I wish that you would add I would love to love to play online with other people and fly around with real people, but you have really nailed the solo flight and missions which I love to play. The only way to give this game a 5 star is if you add a multiplayer feature into the game.', ""Really fun to fly around but the controls are atrocious. Also, I am kinda dissapointed in the planes you can buy with real money, there are loads of them and they don't differ at all from the in games ones (except for the paint job) you sh/could bring some more variety in those. Please just... Fix that, if you care about your players. Thank you"", ""Too many ads. Like, an obscene amount of long, unskippable ads. I get it, it's free. But, there is ad after ad after ad. I like the game, and would even pay for the option to have no ads, but there is not this option. If you are more patient than I, you'll enjoy the game as it is fun. However, just be forewarned; this is a heavy advertising freebie game."", ""This game is bad (not as bad as some others), you say this is 'the BEST free flight simulation game there is' but it isn't because I've played a better one (it has no mandatory ads and is for free). This game is not realistic, the cockpit looks like someone (like my friend) made it (badly). The checkpoints are circles lying flat on the ground when they can be in the sky as rectangles or circles facing the player. In conclusion, these creators are prejudices for their game."", 'Game not really fun. There is only one control choice and the game developers decided to make me control the plane with tilt. That sucks. Now I have to sit upright just to play a game. I mean what if I am in bed. Graphics could be alot better . Missions should make more sense. Like in one mission I had to fly over a person . What is that !', 'I really like this game. It is nice, but I think you should expand the map a little bit more.... It really gets boring playing this sometimes. Also, please add more variety to the planes. I really like more planes to be featured in this game. So that is what I recommend to make the game at least more fun..... Just take my review in seriously.', ""I like this game, but I don't think that the prices for things that cost REAL money should be that high. I think that the MAXIMUM price should be something like $25.99 or something. And the MINIMUM price for something could be like $1.99. Then I MIGHT actually get something on here."", ""Way too many ads for me! The game might be great but I will never know because of the annoyance of simply trying to come into the app and immediately getting hit ad after ad. I can understand that ads generate revenue for free apps but dang this.... IS RIDICULOUS! Plain and simple! No one in their right minds wants to have to go through all this to try your app! Just imagine the amount of downloads you could have if people weren't so annoyed? Hmmmm"", 'Easy controls, decent details, but the cascade of ads caused me to uninstall after the first two episodes. Tried again. Ads! Ads! Ads! I understand the need to get paid for work well done, but too much is still too much.', ""Excellent gameplay, some challenging levels, and you can land on flat spots (not only on airport runways) very realistic handling! Not so difficult to purchase expensive planes too. Dont ignore the updates for too long though, otherwise the game may reset and you lose everything.......this is the 3rd phone i'm downloading this game on, a must have!!!"", 'Absolutely scandalous how this game almost makes you buy content by accidentally pressing a button. Nearly charged 17.49 to buy one single plane as I pressed a button that says try now. Only to be met with one click buy for 17.49. Avoid this game at all costs.', 'Excellent graphics and. Gameplay is also fab .....really enjoyed a lot while playing this game ...but if it had compit view...it would take this game to another level..but besides it..all other things are exceptionally good...this game is worth playing...']"

We've also made some tweaks and solved some pesky bugs, making 8 Ball Pool even smoother for your entertainment!

Download the latest update now to get your hands on new content! Time to hit the tables!","[""Great game. You'll love it! UPDATE: When the game doesn't freeze up and lets your opponent win, it's a fun game. It has happened to me numerous times. Be aware!! I want the developer to explain to me how I have HIGH SPEED INTERNET, but yet this game tells me my connection is slow?! Then I make my shot, WIN THE GAME IN PLENTY OF TIME, but yet the game tells me I ran out of time, and my opponent wins the game! This game freaking sucks! If someone doesn't respond to this post, I will take it out."", ""It's a decent game. Not realistic at all. If you scratch, you can place the cue ball wherever on the table you want. Should not be able to cross the line. One reason why I hardly ever play anymore. The game itself is mostly luck, doesnt take much skill. There are much better (realistic) pool games on the app store. Recommend trying one of them."", ""This game has a lot of potential but a couple of serious flaws hold it back. The player synchronization doesn't always work. I've made shots only to have them be reset saying I ran out of time. The other flaw is the never ending steam of pop-ups between games that want you to spend real money on a game that's not ready for prime time. If you want me to spend real money, make sure I won't lose because of a time sync error. Until then, I'll keep playing for free despite the annoying ads."", ""The glitchiness is getting ridiculous. I lost 3 tournaments because of the static movements. Plz fix it. I might be forced to find a pool game by another developer. (Update)! Well. I updated. The carnival feature isnt there in my version. Dont know why im posting this as nobody cares to respond to anyone's complaints. You are stupid ,money hungry developers . You forgot about making the game fun. ( 2nd update). Uninstalling. Sick of the bulls***.üò†"", ""Gameplay itself is okay. Unfortunately, when I reinstalled the game after trying it years ago and connected using only my Google account, it automatically displayed my old Facebook name (which is not my name now). There is no option to change display name, and as a trans person that old name isn't one I want every opponent seeing, nor one I want to be forced to see every time I look at the screen. Uninstalling, but would try again if the option to set display name were added."", ""It's a fun game overall, just need some bugs fixed , at times it will say you potted the cue ball when you don't and gives the shot to your opponent, which ends up costing you chips if you lose the match, have lost a lot of chips due to this bug in the game, that's why I give 3 stars, and support doesn't respond to mails I have sent about this issue so poor game support as well"", 'Love this game! I love how you can play people from all over the world! Just everything about this game is great! üíú i do wish that you had more chances to earn cash and one more tier that you could play for 10k to win 20k without calling shots everytime. üòä thanks for making this amazing game though! It keeps my mind occupied for hours and hours!', 'I love this pool game . No other pool game can equal this app. One thing its missing is MA SE. The one shot you hit from the top and it makes the ball curve to avoid a bad shot. Hope it would be available . Pls work on it. Thanks miniclip. I recomend this game to anybody. Young , old, male or female. I give it a thumbs up. Chatt A.', ""I have decided on a 1 star because their algorithm is screwed up. They rank me as a level 6 with a random level 141. There are millions of online players but they can't match you with someone your level. The game is broken I hit two perfect shots in the hole but 1 spun in and outward, the second just stopped ON THE EDGE. The game updates every day or so and it takes 5 full minutes of waiting for you to play then. I would not suggest this app to my worst enemy."", 'Review changed to 1 star from 3. I am fed up of the game changing the rules with me. Opponent does not hit rail and I have to take the shot from the spot, I do EXACTLY the same and they have ball in hand!? Also love how they always get fantastic positioning using no spin on the ball which I might add does not work correctly when you do use it ball just goes where the hell it wants. Anyway uninstalled, some advise to players dont buy anything you start to suddenly lose!', ""I'm an avid player of real pool, and this is the best online pool game I've ever played, hands down. It better be, since I spend ridiculous amounts of time on it. Graphics and physics are great, lots of different game styles and table options, excellent social interaction. Highly addicting. Need I say more?"", ""Love the game itself. There are some changes that need to be made though. For example, if someone breaks and runs the table all the way out you lose your coins. If someone doesn't even get a shot then how can you say the Victor beat me. I didn't even play but yet I lost millions. With that said if I break and the other person runs out the table to win. Then I did get a shot so therefore I lost. Seems my opinion don't matter."", 'Fun game, but rigged by Artificial Intelligence posing as real players. I can win 10-15 games in a row on a regular table. As soon as a ""Special Event"" opens up that requires an in app purchase to progress through after losing...you cant win not even one match...even against players who are way under ranked. It\'s totally fake!', ""I have gotten good enough at the game to notice some things. If you are not paying real money, it will do things like force you to scratch, or make the ball roll longer than normal to hide your shot. I also see that sometimes coins are reduced slightly higher than the bet. If you dont pay attention, you wont notice. I still have to watch the advertisements. I understand they have a business, but they still make money off the adds when you dont pay for stuff. It's not as fun when getting screwed."", ""Bad Experience Dear developer, Please have a look at the recent update of the game, and check its impact 1. See the Graphics of Previous Version, it was very good, it did'nt required changes at all...! 2. Check all the cues, some of them are Not at all visible, they have Gone Transparent...,! 3. And how much money you are expecting from us To pay to You..! We were getting daily 1 cash For free from an year now.. And Now You will get it in 75 hours OmG.... What is Wrong .. please look forward."", 'good graphics. accurate shooting. unfortunately no skill involved. the game is algorithm based. you will win/lose based on your win/lose ratio vs your opponent and based on your last in game purchase vs your opponents as well as other components. there is no telling if you will win or not. ive had balls literally jump out of pockets after going in if it was my turn to lose that game.... but a good way to pass the time. The general rule is you are not permitted to maintain higher than 2/3 ratio.', 'Increasing the win percentage is difficult if not impossible. At times it seems like cheats and bots are abundant. The shot clock, and who gets the break is inconsistent. Shots are blocked or otherwise cheated with when you are making headway. Very frustrating usually. I have notified MINICLIP about these problems and I have not seen any improvement, yet an increase of the number of instances of cheats. I am thinking of not playing anymore.', ""Absolutely love it, I do t know how many times I've uninstalled it because of loosing all my coins, but I always reinstall it after I go through the 5 stages of grief. This is the only game that I've kept in my phone for years now. Some come and go but this right here is a keeper. Tips: play safe and don't bet too high, if you loose few games take a breather, only play into millions if you can play 10 or more games. I've been using this technique and now I'm into billions..."", ""Chests disappear when I'm opening them because your stupid random pop up ads for premium stuff take priority and close it. I don't know if I still get what's in the chest or if it's just gone. Fix this. Also, the 'Spin and Win' is totally rigged, you never get the good stuff on the wheel. Otherwise this is a fun pool game and I play it most days."", 'Constantly getting robbed!!! The daily minigames of spin and win never t you get more than 250 coins. Ever. And I bought the poolpass and it didnt give me 4 of the boxes. Lately it also freezes. Will be deleting soon. Which sucks cuz I really like it. Also the free coins every 4 hours has been frozen for 1.5 days. Just not happy.', 'I tried this game because my nephew recommended it and was instantly hooked. I have been playing for months now. There are always new challenges, graphics and sound effects are great, ads are reasonable (they allow you to earn coins, which you need to play in higher levels), and although you are constantly invited to pay for higher options, it is perfectly possible to have hours of play without paying anything. I wish it was possible to switch off notifications of what friends are online.', ""Too Many Cheaters on here. Some of you gamers really piss people off when you intentionally place balls and make your competitor hit them knowing they will miss. Your team need to fix fixed games. Every game I have played for the past 4 days I'm scratching every game. Certain red circle positions should make the the ball stop and it's not doing that. People with high grade cue sticks should only play with other high grade cue users. Some gamers around the globe take forever to continue."", ""Went to the offer wall and went by the rules. They don't give pool cash. Game is fine but stay away from offerwall. You can not call or email. Stay away. The offer wall. They will look only to rip you off after you sign up with dollar shave club. I have a seizure disorder and they just keep telling me it's not enough information"", ""+ points :- Millions of people playing, makes it fast finding an opponent Pretty accurate physics of the game including spin - points :- If you've added 20 friends in this app then it will take 20 clicks to accept all their gifts Etc when you start up the game. Hints:- I prefer 'tap to aim' & horizontal power bar... Try these settings to determine if you like it."", ""The game is just awesome. I can't live even a singal day without playing 8 ball pool. But , I got a problem in recent days. I just updated my android version from 8.1.0 to 9.0 The 8 ball pool is running so slow with breaks of milliseconds. I don't know how to fix the problem. I am just regretting after to update android version of my phone. Kindly provide feedback."", 'Game is very good and enjoyable, ball behaves quite like in real life. Suggestions: add some restrictions like if cue ball is stuck to another, you can hit it with lowest spin as if there is no other ball. Also, add some restrictions, like 3 faults = lost game, or something, there are players who ruin the game by not wanting to hit the ball if it would bring them bad position after that hit. Keep up the good work!', ""The good: Ball spin and reaction is very similar to what is possible on a real pool table. If you are a true billiards lover you will be addicted to the game. If you don't know much about pool, it can be a great game to use as a teaching/learning aid. The bad: If you are really good at the game, it makes it almost impossible for you to get good prizes unless you absolutley work your ass off to get them. The tournaments should be called pocket on all shots, sloppy pool is no fun."", 'Good fun game playing action against real people rather than a computer. Controls at time a little too sensitive, and top cues of cause require real money purchases, so will take you a while to build up a bank of coins to get a fairly decent cue. All in all fun to waste away those quite times if you have nothing better to occupy time.', ""Game is fun. However, when you get a free spin you will NEVER land on anything more than 500 coins. After your free spin they want you to purchase 3 spins. Such a simple thing should free. You may play opponents that aren't active, so you have to wait for their time to expire. If they are inactive you should win be default. Emojis: If you don't have the pass you are limited to what you can say to your opponent. That should be free."", 'Highly recommend this pool game. I really wasn\'t surprised when I found out that nearly everyone I know plays it. The app has lightweight yet smooth graphics, realistic sound effects, many ways to level up as well as improve one\'s game, exciting seasonal challenges, two very different ways to play off-line to practice shooting, etc, etc, etc. I have been ""shooting pool"" with this app for a long enough time to know that it will be around for a very long time.', ""Spectacular! Love it, LoVe It, LOVE IT! Play friends, play strangers, play people all over the world! Very fun, very exciting! My boyfriend and I both play and when we are out at the store or somewhere and people see us playing so many recognize the game immediately! It's so popular and it's obvious why! It's a great game! Thanks 8 ball..."", ""Ya its a pretty good game and if i had the cash it takes to get the good sticks and become a pro id beat everyone out there ...ok well maybe not..it turns out there's some pretty good players on this app ..but I'm having fun and doing pretty good except that once in awhile I'll get a solid ball confused with a stripe ball or vise versa..other than that the game is great and I will recommend it to my friends..."", ""I like playing pool so this game is alright, but I also notice that it will cheat you also. You could have a direct shoot at the hole and miss, and watch someone else do the exact same shoot and the ball go tight into the hole. And that right upper corner shoot is so messed up I have the hardest time with it so I do everything I can not to take a shoot in that direction. Also the rules are stupid, if you shoot and the cue ball hits the next ball of in your bunch, that's all you have to do."", 'I updated my review to one star because there are times when I make my shot, it will go to my opponents turn and give him the chance to win the game. In most instances, he does. When playing high stakes, makes the game bad. Also I am not getting my winning coins after winning the game. That happens all the time. I will not be purchasing anything ever unless the issue is fixed. Please fix.', ""The game is fun however it is difficult to make a good amount of progression without the purchase of the season pass, if you're good enough you'll gradually accumulate alot of coins through games however, the mini games are ridiculous! I have played for 2 years and only ever got 500 coins from the spin and win!"", ""Losing games because of someone else's connection? Yep. I have lost multiple tournaments and games where I was about to win, in the middle of my turn, I am forced to wait for the other player's connection. But when it does reconnect, I lost my turn and lose the game? Time to start looking for a game where I don't get ripped off"", 'I like the lucky shot challenge. No useless ads... I had it 5 stars but I changed it to 1 because the ""spin and win"" the ""boxes"" the ""scratch"" are total Garbage!!! I won 5 ""spin & win"",& I got. 250, 250, 150, 150, 100 coins. Seriously??? I opened a box with Max 200.000 coins, & I got 1000. & the golden spin & win gave me 2500c. Like if it only gives you the lower price every time! Same for the scratches. Fix this issue so it can give also better prices, and then I\'ll change it back to 5 stars.', ""This game is great it's fun to play, and easy in some ways, but it is centered in the offline games category. Also you can't play offline, you can only practice offline, and it has to have a really strong wifi signal. If not it'll just keep loading forever but the weaker the signal it'll pause your game until it gets a stronger signal. Also you only have like 10 seconds to hit the ball if not you'll lose your turn. Please fix this game."", 'Fantastic game with plenty of scenarios to enjoy single play or competitive play. Absolutely no requirement to spend a single penny to have full enjoyment of all aspects of the game from special equipment to tournaments, my favourite game in the store, its simple to pick up and play straight away and extremely easy to enjoy', ""This was my favorite game to play. Very challenging & fun. Its not easy leveling up and winning challenges. Only to be cheated by the game itself. For several months now a $10,000 challenge and win only yields me $3,000. A $2,500 challenge & win yields $600. And $500 gets you $50. WHY? What's up with that? I Have reached out to customer support several times with no response at all. So sad. Fix it and I will give 5 stars. But for now only 1 star for you. My advice play a different pool game.""]"

Occasionally bugs out and doesn't allow me to use special until the end of a fight. I also wish the replays were longer. I enjoy combos to the finishing move but I only get to see the last hit on the instant replay, so it's kind of underwhelming. Overall it exceeded my expectations. But still has some minor issues."", 'Can be extremely buggy at times. Long loading times, and failure to load at all sometimes. Great game on the whole but bugs need fixing!!

Good graphics, realistic techniques, and the game play are especially fun for UFC fans. But unfortunately it looks like EA and the developers just stop caring about it and stopped doing head to head and live events (Story mode gets boring after a while and you stagnate for skill dev.). It still has so much potential and from other reviews seems to be very much enjoyed by most. I really hope they get the online portion up and running again or that they're in the process of making a new one."", 'Love this game , but still need to make it more realistic to UFC, where you fight and to move up in the rankings to possibly have a title fight , then defend the title further on.

First of sometimes the bars/meters for submissions and takedowns ect. disappear and I cannot get a good takedown when this happens and sometimes has lost me the game, though luckily it usually shows up again if you reboot the game. And apart from the occasional crash here and there, my experience has been relatively bug-free. TL;DR: Takedown and submission bars disappear and crashes sometimes.', ""As per typical EA fashion, what could be a fun game is riddled and ultimately ruined by some of the most egregious and overpriced microtransactions I've seen in a while. You want a new fighter, well cough up 30$. The game boils down to essentially tapping the screen to do anything and, aside from the microtransactions, it's biggest issue is not being engaging whatsoever. Tap the screen as fast as possible and hope to KO the other guy. There's no stamina system anywhere so spam away."", 'I love this game but i think you should be able to have title fights more frequently in the career mode.. Also i think you should be able to earn money alot quicker to allow you to upgrade more of your fighters and then also to allow your more advanced fighters to get past the stages theyre stuck on due to lack of coins', ""Over priced! If they had a buyer's incentive to collect fighters easier, I hands-down believe this game will take off financially, and adjustments can be made to make the game that much better for players all around. I understand UFC gotta make their cut, but a better business decision would be to slash prices 30-40% and incentivize with first purchase bonuses, atleast even temporarily. I already purchased however I would be more inclined to purchase again. Good game so far, not great."", ""Very good graphics and gameplay, the only part I don't like is, is when you begin career mode, you are given a fighter , you can't select from the fighters, I was given Alexander Gustafson"", 'Great graphics and physics, great game play, and playability. Affordable upgrades or take a little longer to earn them. Compared to similar games I easily rate this game at at least 9/10. Thanks EA Sports. Love your work.', 'I enjoy the game but it should be more competitive and also you guys need better servers. There is absolutely no reason a company as big as EA should have so many server issues. Could use better graphicsnas well, maybe some blood or at the least a bruised and battered face.', 'graphics are truly exeptional, the gameplay is stunning it is so easy to understand and the controls are great i particularly like the fact there is no buttons at all you just need to tap or swipe depending on what you whish to do.The gameplay is amazing. I would definetly recommend this game. Aswell I played this game for just over an hour and got t level 59 however i am not that good so you could probably do better or the same in about half an hour', 'I love this game almost as much as watching it on tv. It would be nice if using gold coins required a second button tap to insure you actualy wanna slend them. Unfortunatly i have made this mistake a few times when trying to collect them for the training bundle. Other than that would like to see head to head and other competitons. Havent seen 1 yet and have been playing for a month or so', ""always error when i upgrade skill, login and when i play in a cage there no ufc sign and audience, please fix what connection is error and where audience is please put them back i hope this issue will fix fast as can.

But still make u buy more than u actually need just to unlock the fighter u need to play head to head like really five days wow. #BoycottEAsport for just being greedy. Fix that give day wait its horrible to advertise pvp when u cant even play it. A one day wait n to complete a couple mossion is better not a fuc#### five day wait', ""Get it together. Everything is way too expensive, the hit recognition is a joke, and the online connection causes loading screens to take another 30-45 seconds longer. I'm almost embarrassed to say how many hours I've put in this game."", ""So far gameplay is pretty good. I understand the limitations with not having a bunch of buttons . But come on, undisputed and undisputed 2010 were just too dann good back in the day. I'm waiting to adjust my stars according to if and when a pay wall rises and how annoying it is to get different fighters should get a cpl or few for each weight class relatively soon.. and what's up with sonnen being an opponent but I dont see him as a purchasable fighter??!""]"

One thing I don't like about it is during the matches, you have to use a shotgun which makes you have to shoot big animals multiple times before they do down. Also, you can't use purchased gun in the matches, they force you to use one that they pick. To get the most out of the game, you are forced to spend real $$$. Also, a lot of the rewards are tied to watching commercials, mostly of the same thing."", ""Used to play this game 5 years ago. Can't imagine how the first version of this game was totally better than the current version. Platinum Eagles were easier to get, there was more consistency, and also no such thing as PVP. But now, what do we get? A bunch of unnecessary bullcrap. I realise now in order to get platinum eagles, I have to keep playing f-ing PvPs which result in many losses and I have to suffer from having to compete with higher tier hunters and too bad I'm poor.

It has some good graphics and it gives you specific missions and allows you to upgrade your weapon and purchase new weapons with in game currency as well as your own money if you decide to spend money but it is not mandatory.', ""Why does this game need access to my photos, contacts, make and manage phone calls? None of this is necessary to play this game. It also sells all your info and friends info to 3rd parties so it can spam you with junk. If you deny anything it won't let you play.

Only problem I've ever had was the fire button being a little too close to the weapon switch button."", ""This game WOULD be fun if it weren't for the stupid Paywall, and it's pretty steep too. Also, there's a tendency of lining up a PERFECT shot, and then you go to take the shot and NOTHING HAPPENS!!! LIKE SERIOUSLY!!?? Or... You get the perfect shot and then just as you take the shot it lags and makes you miss. This game has me wanting to throw my phone at the wall. Too bad I can only give it one star, because I would go less if I could. This game is far more frustrating than fun."", ""get burnout watching videos for GLU credits and playing the same contract hunts over and over. every weapon and mods cost too damn much and be damn if i would drop real cash for coins cause it just not worth it.

But i go hunting all the time in this game. It has really good graphics. Some stuff is hard and challenging but i like hard stuff in games. Getting glu tokens is mediam . you will love this game', 'not for the greed (new weapon for any region, ad after every 2nd hunt), not for the lethal leg and tail shots or the brain shot through the arse, not for the lame level scrolling or the devaluation of hunter bucks, not for the fact that in 21st century I need to refresh 65 levels one by one and wait for the 10 mins boot time, then why? for the mastermind who put an overlapping swap button on the trigger', 'Good game. But when i start my game it hanged on the map of hidden level 2. Neither back button working nor any other option. Solve my issue.', 'Thought this game looked great so installed it. Opened the game but why on earth does the game need permission to access my contacts, and also to make and receive phone calls?

Thanks for playing!","['Cool game... It seems to have glitches... several times, I have been kicked out by the server and when I log back in, i was told that I had forfeited the game I was playing. It does get pretty annoying especially since it affects my stats and my play credits. Controls are ok. Several times the AI took control of my running back and went a different route than I was going. When passing the ball to a receiver, my selection is not always chosen and is thrown to someone else.', ""Game is another money grab from EA. $30 to play event seasons and thats each. So you can't get a good team by working hard. This should seriously be illegal. Graphics are bad and controls are bad. They basically put their worst team on the game development and expect people to spend 4√ó the cost of the console version just to play different modes. Criminal organization. Hopefully you asshats go bankrupt."", ""So far so good, I have been playing since Madden 18. This game has always been one of my favorites. I started playing Madden 20 in September and it has been a good Madden mobile game. But if you don't have a good signal, it is very annoying. You start playing then it logs you out if you have low or no signal. Overall this game is very great and very well-made. I would recommend this game to anybody who is intrigued in the NFL. P.S. EA if your listening please make a new Rob Gronkowski card soon."", 'Love the game. Buying and selling players, upgrading them, and building a stunning roster. I wish the season mode games were a little harder. It would also be kind of cool if you could make direct player or item trades with league team mates. And lastly, it seems impossible to get Madden cash without paying real money for it. Otherwise great game. Recommend to all.', 'This game is very fun if you like football and know some of the players. The special events they have in madden are fun to work at. The rewards are usually pretty good. The seasons mode is a lot better than last year with the addition of trades. Sometimes they make it too hard to get a player, but overall a great game', 'at the moment I give this game is 2 star. Startibg very first about tthe overalls, I have a 84 overall in DEF and its terrible. Most of my players are ""trained"" highly but when I vs an 73 overall DEF there intercepting my balls left and right? And my players are mostly open but the 73 DEF does a ""boost"" and ints? Trust me it\'s not my OFF either, I have a 85 overall in OFF. Madden used to be a banger back in 2017, but now it\'s once again ..a 2 star :///', ""Decent game. Need a filter for minimum power you would for players. Sometimes an 85 overall player has 10 power I have to look 5 minutes to get the same 85 overall player with 50 power (sometimes he'llbe cheaper to. Power makes a biggggg difference in this game. FIX YOUR DAMN GLITCH!!!! THE DE IS BEATING MY 97 OVERALL OT ON EVERY DAMN PLAY..... 97 OVERALL NOT 80..... I FLIP THE PLAY AND THE SAME THING HAPPENS. FIX IT"", ""Honestly I love this game. It's the best game I ever played. But the only reason I am only giving 4 stars is because the game keeps a black screen every time I open it. I have tolerated this behavior many times, but I ignored it just because the game is so good. But if madden reads my review, I hope that they will fix this problem soon. No pressure Madden, but if you fix this, madden will be the best game ever."", ""Sets dissapear without warning. Just upgraded ultimate legends tier and today there is no way to play for items despite 27weeks showing left on timer. This game rips rug out from under you just as you're making progress and gives a whole new set to work for. Deep pockets blowing mad cash is about the only way. Don't bother unless just really bored."", ""I really love the game, but it's become boring because the Career Tributes on madden today make the game the most fun, now that's the only reason I play. Please put more career tributes. Also, you should give rewards for everyday that you log on. Finally, you should make it easier to upgrade your team as you get better, because without madden can, it's almost impossible to get better. And you should make madden cash buyable with gems, or a lot of coins."", 'Really good addicting game but you need to fix those trash controls. Nevermind, how can a hard team in seasons make a 17-0 comeback in 3rd quarter when I have playmaker and full legend and elite squad. The reality of this game is outrageously unbelievable. How can a 83 ovr. catch the ball over TWO, no, THREE 90 ovr. players!', 'Awesome game but a little hard to understand instructions could be a lot better! 8 think I understand most of the game now starting to get some big high number players now just in time for 2021 to come out just to lose all my hard work and hours of work they should let you take your 2020 players to 2021 that would be cool at least like 10 players or something like that!', ""Can be a fun game easy to level up your team. But just like on the consoles the multiplayer you have to do to level up your couch and league play is horrible. Soon as you snap the ball you get sacked or the QBs throw the ball away. The one that happens all the time is the corners will hold the receivers on the line for the most of the play. Or your receiver's get caught on them when running down the field. Then you play an 80 over team and they act like their a 100 overall and ur team bad"", ""Everything keeps freezing at 99%. I've uninstalled and reinstalled. Cleared history and cookies. When it freezes on league play and overdrive matches it automatically forfeits me every time and in season mode the computer just takes over games when you're playing on defense. No matter what you do they are going to score. Super unrealistic."", ""Where to begin. Teams significantly worse than mine (75OVR vs 91OVR) somehoe have the ability to make interceptions on plays which are inhuman. Hail Mary events in overdrive are impossible. Every second League vs League event I am unable to take part in. My phone locks itself every 2 minutes when playing the game, making online impossible. But the most annoying thing is that the help email doesn't work and I know this has and will fall on deaf ears"", ""Was a fun game, but as soon as I started getting somewhere in the game, it crashed every single time I tried to play anything. I have uninstalled, completely wiped the data from my phone and it doesn't matter. They obviously don't care about the players and it's never worth it to install games like this. Would be a 3 star game if I could, you know, actually play it."", ""I've been playing madden since I was younger and when I saw it in my play store I had to get it . 4 years of playing Madden with my cellphone and this game never let's you down , the mobile version gets better and better every year. Thank you so much for the hard work it definitely pays off."", 'I just got the game a couple of weeks ago and i got to play one season.. I changed the team and then i started a season and whenever the loading percentage went to 100% the app would close... I cancelled the season and tried over and over again.. It also did this with any challenge i tried to do.. I uninstalled and reinstalled many times.. I changed the team back to what i previously had and tried it and it still didnt work... Reeeeee', 'Everytime I play the arena mode, the app shuts itself down and when I reopen the app, it says I forfeited the game. Every. Single. Time!! Then with the h2h mode, I won 23-15 and it also said that i forfeited the game. I played for a week to see if it would get better and aame results. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS GAME', 'In game buys way too expensive. You can spend $75 to $100 just to buy 1 player to upgrade your team. Bad thing is most of these buys can loose value as they release higher ovr players during the season. So you can see you can easily have spend hundreds even thousands of dollars trying to keep your team competitive. Cheaper to buy the newest playstation and a dozen games at $40 to $60 a pop. EA needs to lower their prices to level the playing field. Not everyone has that kind of cash to waist.', 'DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS GAME. It is pay to play....every new promo they bring out a new player they nerf the old ""best player""...You also play A LOT of bots....they also nerf your team so lower rated teams can win. Game play is horrendous as well...many many complaints about controls not working. Just check Twitter for validity of this review.', ""Overdrive players are cheating. Tolerated it long enough until i was ahead by 500pts plus. Then at 0:01 left, the score goes from 798 (me) 276 (them) to 798 (me) and 904 (them). Until you fix your hacker issue (some plays, i am tackled right at the snap. Thus proving that they can see what i am picking. That software does exist btw), I'm done."", ""This game use to be great like two months ago,now it's just bad. Not only going against a team in the arena that has 1,300 team power and you having 850,But when you tap the button to throw the ball it won't even throw at times. And for Overdrive they sometimes give the opponent's extra points for no reason or work that they didnt even do at times! Fix this game please!"", ""Really fun but there are a couple issues. 1) While playing in seasons, after a while the arms will glitch all over the place and it messed up my QB's throws and i lost that game. 2) When playing seasons there should be a difficulty in-between medium and hard because in medium i won every game but in hard i lost every game. Other than this its a fun game and cant wait to keep playing Thanks!"", ""It's a lil slow but I love football so much it doesn't matter. It's a great game for football fans although every game can't be perfect. Especially when they have a console version that brings in real money you can't expect them to update or fix this as much"", 'Fun time killer, but dont take it serious. You can build an ultimate team and see 98 ovr players fumble and drop open passes in overdrive events. Stick with madden today events, and season mode and you will be ok. Dont waste money on this game because your team will look like a pro bowl team one game and a division 3 high school team the next.', 'I cant even play the game because it keeps shutting me out. I try to play an event and then the app stops and goes to my home screen. This used to be a great game, there werent any problems before. I would give it 5 starts if it was the way it was before', ""this game has connection timeouts every 2 minutes I've played this game for like year's and this is the worst year outta all if them im uninstalling and when i play competitive i am winning by lots of points it crashes and i login and it automatically forfeits and it makes m3 lose PS, The game has got alot better since, i took a 4 months break then started playing again."", ""It's a fun game. I always loved madden mobile, but this one I had a difficult time to play. You have little stamina, and the players you play against are sometimes 4-15 overall above you!!! Sometimes when you press on a player, the QB throws it to someone else! Also, the game disconnects frequently even when I'm sitting next to the wifi router."", ""The game was fun at first but once you get further in it gets awful. You can have running backs with 90+ speed and get chased down by lineman. Players can tackle you from 15 yards away. Not to mention the customer service is horrendous. Had a couple problems and both times I emailed them they did absolutely nothing. Didn't get rewards from an event and after asking me the same questions 5 times they basically told me too bad. I guess that's what you get when you outsource your customer service."", 'This app usually works extremely smoothly. However recently I am not receiving rewards for completing Diamond Blitz events. Spending 80 stamina, not receiving a reward, and the attempt still registering, its causing stamina waste. Will definitely increase my rating after this issue is addressed.', 'A great game, but since EA Help stopped email support in favor of phone support I am unable to get help because each time I initiate a case, EA Help sends me an email with two links to initiate a phone support call and both links lead to a blank case information page. Until this very frustrating issue is fixed my rating will stay low. I hope EA Help will reinitiate email help ASAP because I am angry at spending real money and in-game currency on content I then do not receive (aka rip-off).', ""Yay I lost my league I was in hall of fame and it kicked me out of the game so I lost it's so annoying this game sucks. And I hate how you don't get to keep your jerseys after every big update and that's another reason why I hate this game. And EA needs to lower the prices down not a lot of people have spare cash like that"", ""Anybody who gave this game a good rating is either RICH or have played the game only a few times. I have played this game for 4 years in a row. Very dedicated 3 of 4 years. It's a HUGE cash grab now. Even more than before. Go figure it's EA. You have to pay for everything, EVERYTHING! Building your team up does nothing I promise. That 92 overall that costs $100, yes $100 for a fake mobile game card, does absolutely nothing to the performance of your team. FU EA. Scum."", ""Great gameplay and fun game modes but lacks a exhibition mode so after a while the ultimate team gets boring and the stamina gets low to quickly. Also the season mode is fun but I wish I could perpose trades. This still feels like a mut mobile, they are getting closer to a real Madden mobile with season mode but aren't there yet this game gets boring and when microtransactions are required for special seasons or special events there is something wrong - Madden NFL Mobile 20"", ""I play this game and really enjoy playing it. But the new update is what I'm assuming is the problem seeing as how the game played fine before the update but after when I go to play it doesn't load the players. Everything else is fine. I can snap the ball throw the ball run the ball what jat ever i want. But I CAN'T SEE ANY PLAYERS !!!! PLEASE FIX THIS BUG!!!......... I am pleased to say that the bugs have been fixed and the game is awesome. The only problem is the fact of so many new updates."", ""Overall solid play. Only thing I don't like is in head 2 head it'll forfeit without you doing it. Also, it take to long to get the top notch players without spending money. Just the same players over and over in the packs. What's up with these updates every other week? Geesh. Why can't I update this game. Everytime it's time for an update, I always gotta do it over 10 times. What's up with all these updates?"", 'I would say 3.5 stars. Compared with prior seasons, it\'s much less likely that items being auctioned sell. Even items placed well under ""market value"" come back unsold at varying tiers of cards. The result is a giant stockpile of cards as you improve that should be helpful but essentially have very little value. On the positive side, there are so many different ways to play for hours on end that are all pretty interesting.', 'The game is fun, but it needs a little more work to be most popular again. Like adding a practice mode so the player can understand all the moves by learning himself/herself. Controller support needs to be fixed a bit. I sully understand that it was rushed and there is still some updates to it, but the slit delay in movement needs to be fixed if you want to have further more knowledge on what to fix for controller support. Please accept this as a few requests to help the game progress further.', ""My experience madden is really fun now that i'm getting the hang of things and I must say that the designers did a great job with this one because im beginning to like this alot... There is some small things but im sure its because of the phone im using,.. Play style mechanics is overall beautifull for me allmost like im really there.. Uhm.. The graphics mechanics is also superb for an android game... Yes the controls could use a little twitching i think thats all... Well overall your awesome!!""]"

But the cons are that the game freezes and u lose everything. The in app purchases are OUTRAGEOUS! $5 per stadium is ridiculous! And u will need a 2nd job just to buy more coins. Plain stupidity charging that much. But again the MLB doesn't care about their fans as long as they get paid. And what's with the new jerseys? It's just wasting cards we earn and give us no actual benefit. I feel like they just made a game and don't actually care if we have fun or not."", 'terrible, waste of time i played this gm for a few months, spent actual money on stadiums. reached level 70 then the app stayed froze on the logo open screen for 3 days, after which it restarted me back at level 1. after a few half hearted attempts to help from the developers, i have given up after hearing nothing for 3 days now. what was once a big part of not only my day, but my wifes too, is now just another uninstalled app in the memory of our time wasted.', 'The distances for home runs are ludicrous. No one has ever hit a 700 foot homer. Make the game more realistic. Also, home run derby pitches are all meatballs, not curves, sliders, or knucklers. It is a fun game, but not realistic at all.', ""Game doesn't play fairly. Some players are able to hit pitches further and get pitches thrown to them faster. This is counterintuitive because the further a ball travels, the less time you have to bat. The game clearly gives some players an advantage. I know launch angle affects the time a ball carries, so I swing flatter to get pitches faster but then don't get the distance. I have to be at over a 40¬∞ launch angle to hit 800 foot HRs & that slows the rate at which pitches are delivered."", ""Pisses me off!! I not only invested money into this game, but A LOT of time as well!! Never really had any issues until I hit level 52....Now it won't let me back into the game AT ALL!!!! Take it from someone who put MONEY and A LOT OF TIME INTO IT..... DON'T SPEND ANY OF YOUR MONEY ON THIS GAME!! I GIVE IT 5 üëéüëéüëéüëéüëé"", 'I wish it didnt cost so much for different stadiums and upgrades to players/equipment. I find playing the Arcade mode it is very hard to hit home runs. Great game otherwise. The Derby and Multiplayer modes are fun. I play every day.', ""Would rate higher but something needs to be done about playing at Tropicana Field. The stupid catwalks take away too many home runs, and even using the Called Shot boost which is supposed to make every hit a home run, balls hit the catwalk and aren't home runs. Other than that I love this game"", ""The game in itself is a great game but the customer service is extremely poor overall. I have been playing since October and after researching discovered I have invested over $250 into the game. BIG MISTAKE. The game locked up losing all progress twice and I reached out to MLB with no luck. It turns out, I had two emails and they won't help me merge the accounts or restore my data. I know they have the ability to help but choose not to. DO NOT SPEND $$ ON THIS GAME...NOT WORTH IT FOLKS."", ""Batting pitcher throwing sliders, and curves, since when do they do that in a H.R contest. Very, very VERY EXPENSIVE!!! Licenced by MLB, cost is outrageous. Don't they have enough money, could have just gave back to the fans and not charged!!! I WOULD NEVER PAY THOSE PRICES. You ACTUALLY have to pay for each individual stadium to play in it, $4.99 ea. Do not recommend never."", 'I like the game so far. It would be nice to have bigger bucks rewards than coins. A batting button on the left or right of the screen so you know where to tap to hit. There are a few glitches. In some stadiums, you can hit a towering homerun , that leaves the park and still not count as a homerun and some homeruns count when it didnt clear the fence.', 'Overall it\'s a good game. BUTTTTTTT......As many have said changing in pitches especially when your killing it. As well as PVP you either have to be way out in front with HRs. Or ""competition"" catches up with you by hitting multiple HRs...which are impossible for you to do. Stadiums are way too expensive. MLB never has appreciated us as fans when it comes to their merchandise. Cheap quality over inflated prices. Seems the norm. MLB will say you want a piece of your team you have to pay.', ""Fix your damn game. Inconsistent distances, timer still runs in arcade mode, haven't seen a legend card since you started doing those dumbass uniforms, even from a platinum pack. My play of this game has gone to next to nothing because of these bs problems. Haven't seen anything but a bronze pack from the last 50 multi player wins. Add on the fact that it is freezing now with a pop up offer at the beginning. Wish i could give it -5 stars to off set someone else's good rating."", ""BEWARE. Just like everyone else says...you get over level 50 and the app just locks up on the opening screen. I've already had my reset once and built it back up and now it's locked up for over a week. Don't bother."", 'I cant believe how many bugs this game has. Besides the actual in game problems now i have one of the games many attempts to try and get you to spend money stuck at the opening screen and whoever the brilliant programmers are for this game made it impossible to close and I can no longer play the game at all. I can not even get into the game at app because of this pop up thats stuck blocking the entire screen. This game would be decent if the programmers did their easy job correctly.', ""Fun to play, but... After you work your way up to level 50 or higher, the game locks up. My other phones are stuck üò°. Game won't load. I've spent money and collected many limited and classic players. Waste of my time and money. I paid for those cards."", ""It's fun for awhile. I dont understand why the pitches change late in rounds from fastball to change/curve/efus. Doesnt make it very realistic. If Harper's dad would have thrown junk, Bryce might have thrown a bat at him Edit (additional 12/21/19): In the head to head mode, I'm not sure how it's possible that the competition is able to hit HRs significantly faster. I have had quite a few competitions where I've hit a normal HR and my opponent hits two in the same amount of time"", 'Great game but way too many software bugs. The game freezes at least once a week to the point I have to uninstall and reinstall the game. Fortunately, I have a profile that has saved my progress.', 'Takes money to win, home run derby is almost impossible to win unless you spend money on better equipment. They match you ""randomly"" with someone who hits way more HR""s then you because they have either spent money or are way higher ranked and have alot unlocked. They also throw curve balls, if you aim low they pitch high and if you aim high they throw a curve or low. I have never seen a HR deby pitcher throw curve balls. Ridiculously out matched.', ""Pretty good game.. thoroughly enjoyable though could be easier or simple like to unlock things as I've been playing for a while and it's taking it's time all in all good game tho game is currently having issues.. I can't get past an advert for something in game related or it continuously gives me the daily login reward repeatedly I'm heading for the same 24-hour period.. Hope this just a bug issue.."", 'Played for a few months, just long enough for me to level up and get good at, then the game freezes up, forcing me to uninstall.

You no longer have to fantasize about being a goat, your dreams have finally come true!

Gameplay-wise, Goat Simulator is all about causing as much destruction as you possibly can as a goat. It has been compared to an old-school skating game, except instead of being a skater, you're a goat, and instead of doing tricks, you wreck stuff. When it comes to goats, not even the sky is the limit, as you can probably just bug through it and crash the game.

<b>DISCLAIMER</b>
Goat Simulator is a completely stupid game and, to be honest, you should probably spend your money on something else, such as a hula hoop, a pile of bricks, or maybe pool your money together with your friends and buy a real goat.

<b>KEY FEATURES</b>
‚Ä¢ You can be a goat 
‚Ä¢ Get points for wrecking stuff - brag to your friends that you're the alpha goat 
‚Ä¢ MILLIONS OF BUGS! We're only eliminating the crash-bugs, everything else is hilarious and we're keeping it 
‚Ä¢ In-game physics that bug out all the time 
‚Ä¢ Seriously look at that goat's neck

You pay for the full game and progress by expanding/constructing your town thus unlocking buildings and decorations. There are side missions to help as well that are timed but evenly challengYes, even though there are in-app purchases, they are not needed. I have owned this game since it first came out and it has been crucial to every phone I have owned since.', ""Fun game. The game's paid currency is prestige. Prestige is so easy to collect I literally have thousands saved up. After finishing a map, quests that reward prestige start generating infinitely that can be farmed. Baffled that people are struggling with prestige since its so easy to collect. Dont bother buying unlimited fast forward. It's only useful in the beginning when things are slow. Once you stock up on prestige/unlock boosts, fast forward becomes redundant as you can just spend prestige."", ""One of the best games I have ever played. It has almost everything I would love to have in a game. Although I think they need to improve on the military aspect completely. It's childish. If they know, then they should refer to old Caeser III or Pharoah games. Those games were incredible!! Mainly this is NOT a money hogging game !!"", ""This is a good game for micromanagers. If you are patient, you can get everything without paying for it. Paying money will certainly get you there faster, but it isn't required (and there aren't days-long waits for normal game activities which I abhor in a game and is too common in games such as this). Game has a peaceful, friendly, old-fashioned feel that is charming, too. Even the military campaigns have a charm to them, as soldiers are not killed but rather stunned. Very good game."", ""Playing certain Sandbox maps you lose money as it comes in. Not to mention that you can't watch videos for Prestige because of the loading icon over the option to do so! Otherwise I have been looking for a game like this since I was a kid! Kudos Handy Games!"", ""For those complaining about the difficulty progressing the game, buy the premium it's worth it. Then buy the unlimited fastforward and play an endless game, I recommend the Lowlands, play it until tasks are easy to accomplish, and farm prestige! I got about 8000 prestige whilst enjoying building my ideal town, hence the other scenarios came off easy with my farmed prestige. I play this game since 2013 and only able to experience it to the fullest when I bought the premium and the fastforward."", 'Similar to another comment another player has made. I use to play this game a lot a long time ago a was really good, 5 stars. But yea, the creators have made it slow so it takes ages to get anywhere unless you pay even more after you have already purchased the premium. Really has spoil it for me, shame.', ""Excellent building game. Many scenarios to play, the price is cheap for a premium game, and the fast forward feature is good. It's quite challenging at first, but when you grasp all the mechanics it's fun to play."", ""Great game, reminds me of Settlers. 'Premium' is a bit of a stretch, considering you gotta pay more to unlock the games potential. Slow progression; pay extra for unlimited double time. Needs timers for things, progress bars aren't a great time indicator."", 'Well I really like the game. But I also hate the way they put the limits on fast forward function. I first play the free version. Then I buy the premium thinking that I have an unlimited fast forward. But man I still have to pay for the fast forward.', 'The game has potential to be fun except Prestige (earned through ads, real money, or outside of game installs/surveys). The Easy tutorial is fine but I didn\'t enjoy Military tutorial making it only frustrating to play and requiring and watching to gain Prestige to win. I would like a refund please; I paid USD $0.99 (""Premium"" to just get ad-free).', 'This is supposed to be a premium version of an app, but still, it feeds on in app purchases locking away features that should be integrated in a premium version. Making ""speeding the game up"" a prestige feature is what made me write this review.', ""It's a sweetly addictive game and when there was offer to buy it for only 1 dollar and not have to sit through ads, I was delighted. This is one of those kid-appropriate games that holds its flavor!"", 'Awesome small ""The Settlers"" game. Very addictive. Sometimes really hard, but when you know what to do, its easy and rewarding. Try it. I can only recommend it.', 'Used to love this game, but its changed since it has been monetized. It takes ages to get anywhere unless you spend $$ to buy the game then more for double xp and fast forward. There are also in app purchases. You can watch ads but they stop after a day or so and surveys that mostly ask lots of ??? then dump you with very little or no reward. I get devs need to make $$ but it seems a bit greedy to charge for the game and then again for everything you need to stop the game being boringly slow.', 'It\'s an okay game, it\'s not the greatest. It can be fun at times but it\'s going to require a good sum of money. Once you deplete resources (which will happen a lot) you have to pay money or do reviews for ""prestige"" which is in game currency in order to replenish mines, make things faster, or just give you gold. Nothing better than paying money to complete the campaign or have seemingly endless gameplay, as long as you have more money to spend', 'Good game, been playing it for years. Only issue I have, is that the new scenarios have to much text bubbles. You are asked to do a task, but then the characters repeatedly job in with 1 -2 lane text bubbles. One of the new scenarios I seemed to spend more time reading the small speech bubbles then actually doing the challenges. Still a good game overall.', 'First off I would normally give this game a 3.5 but I have a policy of giving only 1 star to any game that constantly interrupts my play asking for a good rating. Or gives me a quest to give them a 5 star rating. The game is good for what it is. A Town building/management game. There is no energy system or off line wait times limiting you on how long you can play at a time. The adds and commercials can get in the way. I actually paid to have them removed but only because I found it on sale @$.99', 'A very good game that brought me hours over hours of fun and joy! I installed it after many years again (maybe 5?) and found that the game had many new features, making it new and exciting, while keeping the same, cozy ""Townsmen feeling"". Especially the research feature promises a long-term improvement aspect, that stays even after finishing one scenario. The game is great as is, only two things I\'d love to see: a better placement mechanism (placing roads is a drag...) and a small campaign.', 'Used to be good before they destroyed it with micro transactions. Now its is soooooo slow to encourage you to pay more. Get rid of all the transactions and put it back the way it was.', ""Fun to play this kind of simulator because of the many resources your town needs. I just hope there will be more and bigger maps, more resources to gather and buildings to build. Though my device kinda slows when my townspeople reaches to 1,000+. Device I'm using is Vivo 7+."", 'Game is really good and addictive, but I made a purchase in game and never received the bonus from it. Everytime I click to purchase again it tell me I already own it but will not let me use it. 5 stars other than that.', 'For a game that demands an up front price, the in app purchases are a bit much.', ""Amazing Game with a nostalgic feel. Really Informative and attentive to details. I like the gameplay as the way it is. With a room for more expansion, it's a great game that needs your attention."", 'This is the only game i am never bored with. I wish theres an option where i can rearrange my buildings and houses tho. Thank you', ""I wanted to like this game. Resource chains, sisters, great graphics and the freedom to build. But I feel that microtransactions has been tracked into the game to make it as slow as infuriatingly possible to get you to pony up more money. Furthermore, it is extremely shallow in terms of complexity and high on grinding and waiting. There are many more games on the PC that cost less than it's asking price of $18 ($6 plus two $6 IAPs for all the features to make it playable)."", ""One of the best city builders on Android. Once you pay to remove all the ads, get double xp, and level up a bit, the game becomes easy, but it's satisfying and fun."", 'I think it would be great, when you upgrade the building, the building shape change, just like in townsmen 6, and why you dont give townie cart so it look awesome in my opinion. I lost my cloud save', ""Good but it could be better. Its kinda hard to earn gold if you're worrying about your kingdom rotting fatser than flash runing to the toilet. Lv 1 structures decay so fast even if nothing is happening."", 'Incredibly disappointed that buying the premium version of this game only disables the in-game adds. Still riddled with micro transactions, you don\'t even get the ability to fast forward freely unless you spend more money. Just feels like they\'re cash grabbing and making things feel tedious and slow until you spend money for their ""upgrades"" which should just be included in the purchased version of the game. I\'m sure the gameplay is fine, but I\'m so frustrated with feeling like I completely wasted my money buying this that I don\'t even want to continue playing it. Really just... Disappointed in the choices they\'ve made for this games ""premium"" version. Certainly doesn\'t feel premium in anyway.', 'I hoped for a settlers clone, I received a game that is littered with microtransactions. The gameplay is really slow and you have to pay once you have used the very limited amount of fast forward icons. Not recommended at all.', 'Fantastic game, it really gets your strategy skills working. I have played for a number of years, but stopped for a while because it became a bit same old, same old. But it has been updated and it takes a while to get the right balance so your Townies (and Townettes!) are 100% happy in everything. If you want it warlike it can be-ish (the bandits are cute), or peaceable, that too. One thing l would love to see added to the decorations is grass! The bare patches of ground really bug me!', ""Good concept, but game is unplayable. Even if I paid for a game, it's designed to get more and more money from you. Buildings are being destroyed by everything (fire, lightning, storm), so you are keep repairing it with every money you have. So you need to pay with prestige, and whops, it's also paid. Really good concept, graphic, idea, but game is unplayable. Really not recommending spending any money on that. It's waste of time and the cash."", 'Game is fun to be sure, played the ad supported one for a while. Changes or options would be nice to control other features, like when building it shows OnSite / Required [0/20], but wish it also showed available, so [0/20]+38, just like the warehouse does in black on right. Late in the game the buildings just seam to up and smoke instead of repair needed notification. Walls should be impassable. I spend all that thalor building a nice wall around my entire estate, just to have bandits walk right through them. Roads are a chore to place. Reduce or eliminate Tavern Requires: Wine / Beer Notifications, especially when those buildings aren\'t even built. I build taverns early just for a happiness bonus, so for them just a place to hang out. Thought the ""Premium"" version was more then just removing the Ad bar from the top! That is all it does, so Premium should say ""Ad Free"" as it does not give unlimited FF, double exp, nothing. Just removes the bar! It still pops up an Ad in game, to unlock features or spend $3.99 for fast forwarding. Please remove ALL Ads from this ""Premium"" version.', ""The game keeps forgetting my saved games, which has ruined this for me and is especially annoying having spent money on it. I've asked for a refund but have been ignored. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS GAME!"", 'Despite paying to remove ads, the game still starts with a ""play these other games"" screen every time, randomly pops up windows to tell you to buy ingame stuff too and annoys you to rate the game too, which is why I won\'t give it more than 3 stars. The game itself is solid, but you really want the unlimited speed up thing to play.', 'This medieval village management sim is a nice attempt at the genre but it seems to be confused. - A premium title, even a low-cost one, should not display a launcher screen on start with 60% of the screen dedicated to advertisements. It took a moment to ""find"" my game. - A modern mobile title should not start with a launcher screen requiring me to select the game I wish to play; I already did that when i tapped the game icon on my phone. I got other beef, but i ran out of space...', ""You know, I played the free version and I kinda liked it. So I bought the premium version so I could get my hands on the unli fast forward. But there is none. Please add the fast forward! And also, please disable microtransactions for the premium version, it's not fun when you have that. Disable rewarded ads as well."", 'I\'m a Cid Mayer\'s fan and this game is just awesome. No frills, no energy that ruins the game experience, no need to bother friends asking for materials and stuff like that. Just relax and enjoy your town and make it grow for as long as you want; even the whole day off you want to! After finding a lot of games round by energy limit and long, long time to wait for most things to be built, I would have never thought I could find a more ""serious"" one on mobile but here it is! Even on the free version you won\'t have any problems gathering anything you need! Good job!üëèüèª', 'Placing a building down is very finicky, as the screen would move when putting it down. Also buildings would snap into place after letting go. I think having the buildings ""snap"" to the placement grid would be more fluid gamewise. Furthermore the roads are an absolute nightmare to place since I would have to go through this process twice. Not only was it hard to place, but it was just as difficult to discern where I was placing the road too. It maybe me but I also had trouble tapping the arrows.']"

There is some in game purchases for new parks, but also in game currency for completing challenges, you can get new decks etc. The actual mechanics of the game are really smooth. Lots of different styles of parks too. It's the only game I've consistently played when bored throughout the years. Sure you can download a few different free skate games, but this one is worth buying as it trumps them all."", ""I have had this game for a number of years, probably around 4 and it's the best skateboarding game all around, but there needs to be a update with tricks no reason not to have ghetto birds, lipslides, the difference between fs/bs, fakie tricks needs to be easier to get into and some new parks.. I feel as the years have gone by the creators have been letting this game go by the wayside which is sad if that's the case.most skateboard games are trash for the phones, or they are forgotten about"", ""This game is fun for a while but eventually you get sick of the one map they give you. All the skate parks range from around ¬£0.80-¬£3 and they are decently large. if you want a fun game that will let you try all its features then this isn't the game. To even experience a tenth of what this game has to offer you will have to pay at least another ¬£4. The fact that you will need to pay to have all the features is stupid when you have paid ¬£2 already you would expect this game to be free."", ""Would've been a 5/5 if it wasn't for the crazy costs. The bolt currency doesn't give you much. You have to pay for pretty much everything. I bought more parks for this game years ago. I stopped using this phone and came back to it a year later. Can't restore the previous purchases, which is pretty lame. Apart from the price of everything it is a fun game. Like I said. If it wasn't for the crazy prices it would've gotten a 5/5 from me."", ""It's a fun game, but it's not like you'll spend hours playing it. It's fun if you have ten minutes to kill, but otherwise, it's ok. I personally got it for free, and I don't thinks it's worth the money. But if you got two bucks to spare, go for it.

It\'s impossible to hook a fish because whenever I swipe up after a fish bites while I\'m in the middle of a lure left right left left combo it goes ""thump"" the noise it makes when you swipe the wrong direction and does nothing and the dishes always get away.', ""I did love this game but once I got a new phone I haven't been able to log in. I spent way too much time playing to start over! Edited to add that I have already sent an email to support before I left my review here and have not received a response yet."", ""It's an awesome little game that passes the time. Annoying things, when you hook a monster or legendary, the little circles get fast and disappear forcing you to eventually watch an ad to resume. Hate that. Otherwise, good game. New lakes would also be appreciated."", ""Well my first impression it's OK, I've been looking for a game like this like the old ea bass championship, I like to drive a boat around pick the spot and see after it hits the water and sinks and watch underwater action I like that and this why I gave 4stars only because it has that underwater view"", 'Great game for me... really helps curb the craving to go fishing or help me feel better about not catching anything on the rare occasion that I dont actually catch when I go fishing.. lol', ""Hreat game!! It's a kittle tough to figure out when you first start but 3 or 4 games into it you get it!! When you do it's a blast!!"", '""This game is so terrible it looks like it was made by a developing fetus and is worse than a game programmed by a actual fish."" That was what I put a while ago when I was mad at the game. But this game is actually amazing. I love it so much.', 'Pretty damn good exactly what I was expecting and executed really well. The paid currency is a much better monetisation method than advert spam. Maybe the money good be earned a little bit faster if anything needed changing or not limit your livewell storage', 'It asks me to login to my google play game account to continue, the Google play game app from which I can see all my saved data and achievements for Rapala fishing .

All other games I play are fine.', 'Minor loading issue but not often Awsome game!!!! addictive wish new pro game was compatible with Android phones', 'I love this app. It past the time when I want to go out and fish in real life.

Nice hits nice fights. All kinds of lures and tackel. A Good time killer.', 'Fun game with pretty decent graphics. Lifelike underwater views.', ""Fun game. Passes the time when you can't get out and get a line wet."", ""I Love this game. Due to my health i can't get out and fish like i want. But this game i like therapy for me!!!!!! THANK YOU!!!!!!"", 'I love it there is one thing you need to add please add more fishing rods and reels and add more lures like jig heads and bucktall and spinning bait please.', ""I was on level 50 and had poles update well now I don't have nothing and says I'm on level 1 and can't get it back have proof of it I'm completely done if I don't get it back screw this"", 'Very buggy - game quits randomly, especially during ads.', 'Would be cool if there was more than just jerkbaits, even if it was just like spinners, and maybe a single top water popper or buzz. Overall still a dope game tho, thanks for putting my home lake on here too #gville', 'Love the lures in real life as well as the game.like the feeling and action', 'Amazing, super fun, cool fish, pretty easy. Good for when you cant real life fish.', ""One of the better fishing game out there. Not corny. It's realistic.I give it a 7/10"", 'Nice graphics, engaging and easy to play for hours, bonus lures are Kool also, good game', ""Great game. Needs more player's control."", ""I'm an avid fisherman and the game is pretty good. With the exception of the outdoorsy air and waterspray, it's cool."", 'Game will be removed today because of the games security issues....then they try hiding it with an update because of sign in issues they call it....FACT...facebook REMOVED the game cause SOMEONE that works there is SELLING our INFO TO STRANGERS....not cool!!!....i am ADVISING everyone to do the same and remove this game....TRUST IS HUGE and this game CAN NOT BE TRUSTED', 'Passes time, if you have the patience for advertising.', ""I used to play the game a lot but can't Facebook sign in anymore would like previous account back"", 'Im pisst!!!!

I can wait for minutes not hours. And let me just mention all the ads, OMG! Seriously at the beginning there are like 10 ads, and you can\'t go anywhere without being bombarded with ""10,000 gems! ($5.99)"".*EX*. Overall, its a lot of fun, but the wait is too long for things, and too many ads.', ""Not been playing long, but my son has been and it was seeing his game that got me into it. 2 years in the making so patience is the right word for this game. Just getting the hang of things. It does take patience, but you can still progress better as you get more experienced. Now I am well into the game, it's great stuff and rewarding as well."", 'I really hate this game. so this is why I hate it CHAT!I was starting to like chat but all the players act dumb. Cancel chat and MAYBE just MAYBE this game will be installed again. Another problem is the glitch. Its getting on my nerves. Stop the glitch NOW!. The third reason I deleted this game is because EVERYTHING COST MONEY. All you want is money so thats why the prices are high. so how about you guys use gold instead of money. As you can see These 3 reasons explain why I deleted Dragon city', ""Oh my God.. ALL my LIFE I've been looking for a good dragon game but then my sister started playing this which got lots of people I know to play this game and be together in our alliance. This game found me and it is SOOO cool and wonderful!! What a great game. But I have one problem.. Sometimes you can't do anything, I know you want money but maybe not every cool thing takes things like that?"", ""So far I like it. Can't wait too see how This builds up. Ok... Level 19 now & In Love with this game! Sold a couple of Dragons & totally felt bad...like they were real pets..Every time I get a new egg ..can't wait too see what it's going too grow up like...so many wonderful, colourful Dragons!! There are Alliances, duels, contests & more.üíóüíóüíØüíóüíó Thankyou for a great game!!!! Absolutly Love this Game!!!!!!"", ""Amazing game. I had to stop playing for a while because I didn't have the time, but, anyways, I've started getting into it again since yesterday and I LOOOOOVED it. It's just funny how I forgot things from this!! üòÇü§¶\u200d‚ôÄÔ∏è If you guys are looking for a game that won't let you down, then you just found it. Download Dragon City now and you'll be and feel amazed. (I think I got a little bit carried away there üòÇ) Anyways... Enjoy ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§ This Game is THE best game in the world!! I am such a huge fan!"", ""I like the game.It's cool about the different dragons even though there seems that some don't look like dragons at all.I like some of there moves but could be better.Like instead of punch it could be bite,scratch,strike.Some doesn't look like they could punch.I try to overlook it at certain times & play the game but I believe it could be better.It seems some silliness was added & thats why I overlook & play the game.I still rated the game 5 stars because my kids play and like the game too."", ""Love this game!! The dragons are awesome. My experience this time around is much better. I got this game on another device and for some reason after the first few levels of my first 3 dragons, I couldn't see what they looked like, almost as if nothing was loading all the way. I couldn't see my dragons, habitats, buildings, or words, so I had to delete it because nothing worked to fix it. Thankfully though, everything is working beautifully this time."", ""I love this game there is so much you can do! It is so addicting so fun and a great time killer I love that you can name a dragons and you can do like mini battles for gems and they're like competitions like little events that you can participate in and there's so many dragons you can get and they're all adorable! Not to mention there are alliances that you can have alliance with players and you can chat in general chat and make your own alliance. I definitely recommend this game 5\\5 keep it up!"", ""Don't like League battles as the dragon levels I am fighting are very uneven. No sooner do I get my dragons to a matching level (eg. 20) than those I am battling are at least 5 levels higher and are practically impossible to beat (25). Wish the cost of making food was more in line with how long it takes to grow it. Still a pretty good game though."", ""I didn't expect to play as long as I have. The waits for dragons to mate and long waits for the eggs to hatch afterwards is annoying however, the devs keep you busy with puzzles, fights and, quests that it is worth sticking around. Curiosity is my main force to keep playing. I can't wait to see what my iridescent dragon looks like."", ""You can't get all dragons from about 90% events, not without paying real money, a lot of money, like $20-50 for ONE evt, and there are 5-10 evts/month. The other 10% are heroic races, you have to be very dedicated to get to lap 15. They give out a lot of gems, about 6-7 gems per day, and some events give you 150+. But it runs out fast, like 2000+ gems to unlock islands, hatch, breed, evts, etc. Also you need 100m+ foods to be able to fight past 10000 trophy. Under a year you'll have to pay."", ""1. I live in Australia so all the in-app purchases are twice the ammount you say they are. 2. Who even purchases in-app purchases? 3. Please stop giving me pop-ups every time I enter the game. 4. It's way too hard to get gems, I have 0 as I'm writing this and I don't know how to get more without watching ad and then waiting hours to watch another one. Those are my only complaints."", ""Hello! Personally l think that it is the BEST GAME EVER! It's so fun and has amazing features. For example each dragon has their own element. In this game you can battle with other dragons, get xp so you can level up(when you level up you can do more things), you can get gems from a streak on how long you play for(and for other things like buying them),and more! I suggest you definitely play this game now. Then give you opinion on this game!"", 'It\'s a great game but way too commercialized. Too many ads, too many ""special offers"" all the time. And some parts of the game just can\'t be done without spending a ton of gems. There was a heroic race recently and as soon as it ended, two ""Heroic Combat"" quests popped up. The minimum requirements for these quests-dragons from the Heroic Race, which ended 15 minutes ago. It takes 60 hours for the heroic dragon to hatch and the duration of the quests was.....60 hours. Doesn\'t make sense. 3 stars.', ""I am still actively playing this game everyday..I really like the seemingly endless types of dragons that you all have created and various offers threwout playing....i wish the offers for the promotional dragons or *v.i.p* dragons etc. Etc. Were not so expensive..sad to say that from level 1-38 I didn't have the chance to buy one of the level up promotion special surprise offers...it would be cool to have gotten to do some of those things...."", ""I have been playing dragon city for years and have enjoyed it more and more. Dragon City is better this time around. I do have a problem though--when I am playing in a race, when I need to get food the game doesn't take all the food at once! I have been trying to get 10 for quite a while now, I have 14 farms, and I get a couple taken off at a time. It's hard to finish a round when you have this problem! ."", ""It's a fun game I like it but there are to many quest that u have to use gems for and there should be an easier way to get the gems other than buy them. Let us watch a few videos or make quest so u can earn them. Other than that it's fun. Fix it we can watch videos to shorten the time u have to wait on something too."", ""This game is very nice! It's colorful, it's cute, and the dragons are very creative. However, this game basically constantly remind you of how broke you are. As soon as you launch the game you will see ads upon ads about offers and deals, of dragons costing $10 to $20, of which I think is completely outrageous. It takes a very, very long time for simple task to be done, such as hatching eggs or growing food, and really the only way to progress is by eventually spending money or watching ads."", 'Cute fun game. But the ads are misleading. All about how much money they can get from you. Have to click through 5 or more ad purchases each time you log on before you can play game. Customer service is the worst i have seen. I have played several games. Customer service says ""Sorry, screw you"". If you have plenty of money to spend and dont need customer service. Then its a good game. But poor customer servive always gets only 1 star.', ""I LOVE THIS GAME! It's just so fun to play! The dragons are also vary cute, and cool too! You can have lots of FREE things in this game! Like: Gems, coins, and some more things to help you expand your land for your dragons! But, dont just hear it from me; try this game out for yourself! If you do hope you can beat me. üòâüëçHave an amazing day!!!"", ""Dragon City is the best game on my phone you can do all sorts of things with your dragons you can battle them and fights. you can breed other dragons get more dragons. the more you play the more you level up.this game is awesome !I play this game like all day. it's almost addicting I would recommend this game five stars. If you're curious about this game I want to try it out I would totally do that you won't regret"", ""I've loved this game and I have hated it. It is a wonderful game but it is so loaded with stress and frustrations! The rewards are great but they pull up the bonus games so fast, you'll barely get a taste most times unless you pay out money! The stronger I make my dragons, the more I get defeated in the arenas and leagues. It is never enough! Game always leaves you hanging. And I'm about ready to delete it for that! All that hard work will be forgotten once I free myself because it is that bad!"", ""The game is good but the creator of this is a money greedy. If you want more money then fix the ad socialpoint. It became almost the best game but the money is all you want right. You don't really care about are happiness about this game and make almost all the dragon are only can be obtained by purchasing money on those things and blah blah blah. Even some common dragon can only be purchase by gem in the market and the other way is breeding but you always get the other dragon with same type."", 'This is a really amazing game where you can fight in quests and leagues, and all sorts of stuff!and this isnt a stupid thingy where i say its amazing and its an ok game. When i say its awsome,you can rely on me!!! Oh yeah, and all the dragons are super cute too. You never lose your dragons when youre fighting, only when youre on your island and you want to sell the poor thing. Try it out! There honestly isnt any bad things ive noticed yet in my 4 years of playing it!!!', ""I love this game because you can do lots of stuff like battles other dragons create your own habitats get different types of dragons from all over the world. And I do not have problems with this game. If you rate this app five stars you got the best of all the of the whole thing .You don't have to pay it's totally free and you could also get free food Free Victory and free gold by just those statues on speech of your territory.Get it now its the best game ever.I LOVE THIS APP GET IT NOW!!!!!!!!"", ""I love it I'm obsessed I play everyday sometimes all night. Wish the breeding times and such weren't as long so I could play more. I've noticed the game a little slow lately and I've had to restart it and it's still slow but not super bad just a little annoying of course. But other than that awesome game!"", 'This is a very cutesy, fun game. It has the potential to be addicting. However, when entering the game there is a flood of ads. ""Buy this, buy that, get this pack!"" You have to go through about ten or fifteen deals with ""reduced price if you purchase now"" before you get to the actual game. This is highly annoying and makes me dread opening the app.', 'Ive been playing this game on and off for few years and i rly love the new updates. at first i was not interested because it was hard to level up w/o purchase gems but when i open this game early last year there are many events that can help to get gems and I.AM.ABSOLUTELY.FLOORED. i had always loves this game with all unique dragon designs. and all these events are interesting and all themes are getting more interesting each time ~~ Kudos for developers for bringing us this wonderful games o(*‚âß‚ñΩ‚â¶)„Éé‚úßÀñ¬∞', ""Best game I've ever installed. Since day one I've been hooked. The dragons are unique and very kewl, the ads aren't as bad as some other apps, and the different events are nice. I also like the chat, which is entertaining to go on when your waiting for dragons to finish breeding or something like that. All and all, it is an awesome game."", ""Very fun and good, but I think it has too many pop ups. It takes forever to load, and is way too glitchy. Sometimes it won't let you exit out of an ad, and it is always trying to get you to buy something. It is a very fun game, probably good for 8 and up, but it just has some problems with ads and glitches. It's fun, but the ads prevent it from reaching it's full potential."", ""I really love this game but occasionally it glitches out and I lose whatever it is i just collected or got. For example, this morning I hot a love dragon and the game glitched out and I checked my storage, no love dragon. I went into support to report it but there was no report option. I'm very salty about losing that dragon due to a game glitch."", ""It's a great game, the prices to get stuff are a reasonable price unlike other games like this, they have alot of cool dragons. The battles are fun. Good graphics, good controls, and gives you free stuff in game, so you don't always have to pay. Great game overall"", 'I really love this game, but the only thing i can suggest is to make the battle modes more interactive and exciting, though i have nothing bad to say about its animation, i just want it to be more fun when im playing it, and may i suggest fighting dragons in the battle mode will have an option of playing it in online in which both players are fighting each other live.', 'I enjoy the game, I just hate the fact that you have to pay 4 dollars for your piggy bank when the only way to really get anything done is the game is to spend gems or put more money into the game to make you stronger. All I want is an easy way to get a lot of gems so I am actually able to get all the dragons and not be worried about running out of time to get them. As a suggestion, make all the dragons be breedable and not this orb and card packs that you have to pay more money. Thank you', 'While game itself is good, it would be nice to be able to improve your dragons without watching a million ads. You can but the ad rewards are far greater. Also there really needs to be an option to close the pop up ads when the game starts. It gets really anyone having to close as many as 15 boxes each time you open the game.', 'Aside from way too many pop-ups, there is now zero support. Contacted several times about lost credits, but not one response. This game has gone from five stars to two, and that may be generous.', ""I like the game, fun game for relaxing and wasting time (if you don't like spending money i don't think racing works). I tried some battles but some battles are a bit confusing. fire is usually weak against water. I can't figure out what the strengths and weakness are."", ""Love. It. I love love love your dragons and habitats and trading and summoning and breeding and hatching and--ok. I'll stop. Only one thing: my dragons are on a mission. I try to go and get them, but it says it still is loading. So I want my dragons back. Thanks, Dragon City. Update : Cannot climb cake tower. Has been a week since I couldnt get me dragons back from towers. Cannot breed Lachy dragon cause my dragons are on a mission. Accidentally clicked on breeding mount. Cannot speed up egg. üêâ"", ""The game is fun. But it's very annoying to have to go through all the offers every time you sign on. Plus I don't like having to spend real money to get any where in a game. It's frustrating not to be able to advance without buying gems. This game doesn't offer enough ways to earn a significant amount of gems to get anything. I'm home is still playing because my granddaughter loves it. Less cost and it would be a great game.""]"

Overall the app version of the game is pretty good, but if it was to make a new user, I would suggest using the web version of the game to do so, since I could only randomize to change the apperance.""]"

Thank you for playing TrainStation!","[""Decent game, although I could do without the train advertising a micro transaction every 2 minutes. There is also a new sound bug where the sound of an arriving train will play constantly. Progress is super slow like any free game. The game contains a lot of info about trains, and having friends playing it, is a big advantage. Give it a go if you like trains, but be warned, it's like any f2p game, just with trains instead."", 'Great time passer, excellent mix of challenges to make you vary your aims and keep you interested in the game, if your in a rush you can quickly resend to a short destination, if you know you cant play a while send out for longer.', ""I think I've been playing this game for well over 5 years now omg, I've gotten to level 630 (as of now). Love the game, but I do think that we need more contracts as the game progresses on (only left with two regular, and an infinite contract). Love the diversity of the rolling stock and the challenging contracts."", ""Love the detail on all the trains. I can't wait to get a high enough level to make an all dutch station :) One tiny thing that bothers me is that the view moves way too easilly when you're trying to tap on trains, balloons, xp bubbles etc. I try to keep the view lined up with the destination buttons so I can send trains on their way faster. Again, just a minor gripe :) I'm playing on a Samsung Galaxy S6"", ""This is lots of fun. I was looking for a railroad game while I was travelling and found this. The only thing I don't understand is gifts and friends. I connected my gmail account but my only friend is Mr. Bill and I can't find others. It seems it is connected to the outdated Google+ idea?"", 'Downloaded game from play store, clicked on Play now for new users and started playing all the way to lvl 51. Then joined a FB page to increase my knowledge of game but lost everything when I logged into the game using FB. Even logging in with my email I was still only lvl 1. FB group is awesome!', ""I have got a collectible train and wagons/coaches, and Im back and I see I lost all of my progress, all of the hard work I've put on that acc and it's gone, all gone like an water, then I looked like an idiot that Ive lost all my trains I got and money spend on. Pls if you see this back it upüò†üò†üò†\U0001f92c"", 'Tried and true transport game. Dispatch trains to gather materials, help contractors with their tasks and earn unique rewards. Imaginative storylines and attractive 2-D graphics. Flexible gameplay allows one to advance irregardless of personal schedule although not strictly an idle game.', ""Its a little confusing still, but it looks like you've made some improvement in the scoring... Let cha know more later... Still haven't figured out replacing, changing and building the trains, as well as the feats. Its always saying im not delivering to the rights recipients üôÉ"", 'The game looks very intrestimg in play store but i downloaded the game it does not load after 60 % load please fix this issue', ""Very very slow progress unless you're willing to spend tons of money on in game purchases. Its obvious the whole game is focused on trying to force you to buy gems."", ""Love the history of diferent engines. It isn't to hard to play."", ""Fun game however, LAGS extremely bad on Facebook to the point it's no longer fun, and the special offer trains are rather annoying when they come through EVERY 2 mins lol. Used to be fun, but no so much anymore"", 'The game server crashes literally every time I sell resources, this has happened so many times its getting ridiculous', 'This game is very good. Going level by level it is good. I am enjoying it. Learning about the type of engines and capacities', ""Cool game good graphics. Just wish things went a bit faster. I'm looking for a fun game, not a long game"", ""Very great game but I wish they would add road trains as well it's as much a train as maglev or hyperloop"", ""Very addicting and fun but I wish it wouldn't turn into a clicker game but besides that it is a very good game"", 'Very enjoyable game and plus I like trains alot . Been playing it for years .', 'will be cool if the in game friend list can be worked out from within the game, not external source like facebook.', 'Update 21st of December 2019: Addictive game which is great for chilling out to, but some people become uber competitive about it. üòÅ', 'The controls, themes and all theme locomotives made the game more interesting.', 'Well, this game is just amazing.

So till running normal only 1 star out of five stars."", ""Having some trouble with the in-game 'speed ups' ie 'train speed up' and the 'mini game'.

I'll re-rate this game once it is fixed. Regards * game play is still hindered by a bug! Please do not download this game."", ""I have been playing it for a long long time and Ibreally like it. I want to say that don't give 3 hours tike for international train to complete once. Some train sets can't be used to send to contract stations that's weird which would have gained more revenue. Please give better engines which can pull 10 cars atleast. 5 cars engine are worst. Less revenue more fuel or uranium. That's all. Overall. Fun game and time killer."", ""This game sucks now, you have to wait years just to be able to buy a new station theme, the recent one they added is only for high level players, very happy i didnt spend a penny on this game, my money is staying in my bank account.

Game is now also crashing when I start app. Not happy anymore."", 'First off i still like this game! i have been playing for a very long time now too! Before i played on PC now i play on Both.

It isnt idle at all Fyi this is game is orginally a facebook game but now they added it on mobile! it does not need instructions whatsoever, i read the reviews and i was amused.', ""Not great. Buyed something from this game, deleted the game then installed the game to find the purchase was forgotten, never to be found again.

The voting is also very unique to add to a game like this. It is also really generous to use a game as awesome as this one to sponser other ones. And unlike Choices this game is appropriate for all ages at all moments. Thank you for making this game and God bless. ‚ù§Ô∏è"", ""I played this game when I had started high school and I'm glad to have found it again after some years. It's definitely as cute as I remember and, unfortunately, still has the same tedious wait times. Still, the story is fun, and so are the characters! I just wish that, after all this time, I'd be able to play as a different type of classmate than the base three we have to choose from in the beginning."", 'Plot is very intresting, and I love that there are sequels, but it bothers me how long every event (Parties, some quests, construction, etc) takes. With no rings and a lot of free time, I find myself pointlessly checking on the game even though my quest is no where near finished with time. I love the game, but I think this could use a fix.', ""Some of the tech & language is dated. Then it's expensive. The more you play, the more expensive it gets. Too many quests reguire you to spend $ you don't have to fully play. If you played as they want you to you could spend 80$ a month @_@! So for a quest evrry 5 min they hit you up to spend $ to keep going. As others say, If you don't spend you wait 8 hrs. At least you can run 5 quests at once. I playit 20 min 2x a day. Story line is superb, characters are lovable. The way HS should be!!!!"", ""I love this game cause of the outfit for your character and games with fun decorations for parties. But I want to ask you to make it more fun than that I'm going to keep on playing with the game and wait for an update if you want so it will be more popular and all of the people will rate five stars. You know what my cousin likes this game and she is playing this for one year and even though she goes to school she played with it like me. So for now this game is my most favorite of all."", ""This is one if the best apps I've ever encountered. It's just totally awesome that I get to build high school MY way,characters and all. I really love having the option to name my charaters. My only problem is that i wish the characters made sounds when talking with each other and that we can participate in the characters dating. However, I'll still give 5 stars. Thumbs up to Pixleberry. üëçüíìüíì"", ""I absolutely love this game but 4 times in the past 2 months it has completely deleted my progress, even if I had it saved! It's really upsetting cause it took me a long time to get to where I was and when I tried to go back into the app it literally reset me to the beginning of choosing my character. This happened a while ago and it didn't accept that I had a previously saved game so I've lost all that progress too."", ""Kinda sad in a way as I can't seem to play this game offline anymore:( offline it always goes off while it is loading so I can't get into the game while I'm outside where there is no wifi. Last time I was able to play this game outside without wifi and hopefully the producers can change and allow it to be played without using wifiüôè"", 'I love this game but, there are some problems. The wait times are way too long=not enough currency=not enough students=longer wait times=not enough space=longer wait times. So in conclusion, the wait times are so long they cause longer ones. Also I would like to be able to play as an artist. Why arent all the base character types options to play as?', ""This game is the best one I have ever played, it's been through half of my life. My classmate recommended this during 4th grade, now I'm in my 8th and I could not be more thankful, the stories are amazing and highly satisfactory. It inspires me to write, and I just love every single characters like Julian, Payton, Autumn, Mia, Ezra, Kallie, Sakura, Nishan, Wes, Katherine and even Max and Kara.I fell in love with every single one of them, when it ended I cried, but beautiful stories end right?"", ""I love this app. It's so fun and I could play this for hours. My only problem is it takes soooooo long to make people couples on the Isle of love and somtimes the dates fail, I love this game otherwise."", ""I used to really enjoy playing this game but since Pixelberry have stopped updating it quests cannot be completed, hangouts cannot be purchased & class mates cannot be admitted so I'm completely stuck with characters that can't be placed due to the hangouts no longer being available. This game had a huge following & I find it very disappointing that the whole team would just drop this as it will forever be popular regardless of age or sex."", ""Something to play when I'm bored. The polls are my favorite part. It's difficult and time consuming to get rare people, and it's near impossible to get special characters without spending money. But there's a bunch of other stuff to do that it's still a good game"", 'Great game except when you have a new device. Your old data can never be retrieved and if you pay close attention to these reviews they respond to everyone else except us one star reviewers. The developers should consider another way to get the customers account back when they have a new device', ""This app is amazing even though it's glitchy at times. The only problems are how the characters and quests are kinda bad and how rings are extremely hard to get. I know there's a Linking thing but does it look like I have friends who play this app? Nah."", ""It is a really good game but why does every little thing or quest take 2 or 3hours or even more and we also have to use rings to rush which is hard to earn please work on this to make it convenient for players because most times when i have no rings to rush i quit the game and come back later & it's so fustrating other than this the game is wonderful and Please make easier ways to earn rings and give more rings as rewards for quest also make activities visual not just orally"", ""Its fun and all, but if the characters you design and are already in the system could do more than just walk around that'd be a bit more interesting. Like walking in and out of their assigned homes or sitting on around fire for a few seconds would be cool."", ""It's really fun and entertaining! I really love it, but I wish you could just restart it in-game instead of having to unintelligible and re-download it again."", ""I've been on this app since it was first releashed (I had to start over due to switching phones) and I never get tired of it. The story, the characters, everything about this app is amazing! I wish there were other chances to earn diamomds and get dates with Max though"", 'I love this game there is just one thing i want to be able to change my type like if im a prep later on when i unlocked the party place then you party with your character with an example a jock then you get a cheerleader then you then change yourself into a cheerleader but only if that person has a prep in or like the type you choose at the beginning', ""the problem is students start walking on grass even though i spent 380 coins on path. I have to wait too long for little things and it's really annoying. please fix this and i will give 5 stars"", 'This game is incredibly fun. The quests can be relatable to real life experiences and openly accepts diversity as though it were normal. That said, I believe that there are certain fundamental flaws within the gameplay. First of all, the quests involving expansion only specify to expand when told to do so, so people uniformed of this fact are held back from advancing for a tad bit longer than others. Also the classrooms should give more books for the same price, as it is flawed in terms of time.', ""This game has a great message, great characters, the music is memorable especially the song that plays when you level up. It's very fun!"", 'Love the game. Been playing it since i was 9. Really hope you can make a new one. These games are really dope and i really appreciate the story line and the characters', ""It was a good game but I stuck in level 3. I couldn't unlock new hangout room and couldn't admit new student. It needs to improve."", ""I used to really like it at first, but after reaching halfway through LVL 4, the game lags very terribly. It'll turn on, but when the game fully loads, it'll freeze and immediately crash afterwards. I removed almost all my other apps just to play it, but nothing even works. My storage space is plenty, and I'm so confused why this is happening. Please, if you could, fix this issue."", ""It's a fun game but, everything 'good' costs rings. Not every person has actual mobey to spend on getting more rings. But overall it's a really fun game and the character's personalitys are funny!"", ""Right now i'm not happy with hss my progress was lost all that time playing quests partying to get characters not to mention after weeks of partying finally a mascot guy and a female slacker and now there gone collecting coins, pencils and ordering books etc have been a waste of my time and what am i supposed to do play it again why should i especially if it happens again. Im actually really angry and feel like not bothering with this game anymore thanks alot for wasting my time."", ""I like the game and it has variety. Not being able to progress from level 8 without spending money ruins it completely. Many other games make a lot of money from advertisements and paying players. That it's rigged to not have the option is reprehensible. Money can still be made from advertisements. It could be far more popular. Don't bother downloading until it's fixed."", ""Great game really, I enjoy playing it, there are many rare classmates you can collect :) But, I recently bought the Prom Throne, and I even recieved a reciept, sent to my email confirming my purchase, but never recieved it. I contacted customer service twice now, and one of the workers stopped helping me. So if you don't want to waste your money, don't buy anything from the game, I payed my money, didn't get what I payed, and didn't even get my money back, nor was even offered it, just ignored."", ""It's a good game and I like it The character types are a little cliche at first and its really hard to get rings but you get more character types along the way and it's an okay game The rings are still annoying though :-/"", ""Give us the option to unbind/unlink our game progress and transfer it to another email/facebook PLEASE. I've been playing since 2014 and I so badly want to transfer my progress to my main email and link it to my new facebook account. I DON'T WANT TO WASTE EVERYTHING I'VE COLLECTED. At least GIVE US THAT OPTION."", 'My account keeps freezing everytime it tries to give me my reward for the quests.

- And more!","[""The game has some fun gameplay at its core, but wow, are the developers money-hungry! So many basic things are locked behind advertisements or VIP status (overpriced monthly subscription). There are too many panels leading to the in-game store, where things are hideously overpriced. There are also many instances where the game alludes to you permanently unlocking things with in-game cash, but they're actually one-time use items/instances. Would not recommend games from this company."", 'its an exteremely good game. BUT. the only thing i criticise is the sly ways of getting people to purchase bucks and DNA. And i think mist people know that. Also, move the solud hold pack back to 5,000 loyalty points. The struggle to get 10,000 points is not fair. i see this as another way of you earning money. And i think The gaming beaver would agree with me on this. Please. Change the solid gold pack down to 5,000. im sure most people would agree with me on this.', 'I love the game and being an over the road trucker it helps pass the time my only complaint is that so many of the dinosaurs, the cenizoic, and aquatic are special events and even if you do unlock them by a pack or special event you cant just add to them you have to wait to unlock them again I believe it would be better whether you unlock them via a pack or special event you should have it', 'I like the game its really fun but i think the creators of the game should make hybirds and dna should make a superhybird. But the only thing is that when a dinosaur\U0001f996 escapes it takes to long u have to wait for like 4:00 hours i think, and thats to long like at least make it, 2:00 hours at LEAST!! 2:00 hours pls. Okay thats it bye', ""This game has the best graphics I've seen on a mobile game I would definitely recommend you downloading this it's really fun and helps you learn about your dinos and it's just fun it is harder to play the game without the VIP experience but without it it's still a fun game I don't have a VIP and I'm having an amazing time great dinos just hate the prices on the stuff and just amazing download it it's worth it"", ""Excellent game but it would be a plus to create your own dinosaur in an incubator and see its progression. For example picking defensive traits, speed, and strength..things in that manner. Still lots of fun and I'm sure it will only get better."", 'The game has been worked on drastically and now matchmaking has been better than ever but sometimes i do get screwed over and sometimes its also not fair to people im up against because they use my gold dinos against common dinos which isnt fair to them also. And the ads still close which needs working on.', 'I love this game and some fact I really like the most like I was able to continue the match after some period of time which I like the the most but their are some falts wich I like to point out 1) there are no common, rare,water dinos 2) there are less number of water dino and their hybrids in Opinion 3) there Rediciously very less numbers prehistoric mamals their hybrid,same with aqatic dinos.lwish I would be able to see these corrections in the game.Though I gave some fault the game is divine.', ""this game is awesome because it's got a whole lot of everything but I wish when you are in a tortament and the game glitches then you loose the creatures you choose so I think that needs some fixing because what if that's your best creature then you loose it so just make it so if the game glitches out you don't loose that creature and so with the pvp battles"", ""It is the best dinosaur game ever, just when I don't play for 24h, I need to wait for the loading screen which takes long, oh and can there be friend adding and challenges with friends like in jw alive? Advise all prehistoric gamers to download this (not like ACTUALLY Prehistoric, OK?!)"", 'I play this game and its amazing just how many dinosaurs you can collect and its just a game for any fan of dinos.

I'm not very very good with phone and don't even know how to take a screen shot on it. it just keeps taking a while to load and kicking me out"", ""I used to really enjoy the game. The dinosaurs were awesome and they still are. But what I really hate are the battles. I'm on battle stage 19, and that originally, that meant I had a T.rex, but after I updated, T.rex is on stage 54! And instead of dinosaurs as battle rewards, they give DNA! Like anyone needs that! What are Ludia and Universal thinking? And if Ludia and Universal are reading this, change the battle stages back to the normal stages. But other than that, it's an awesome game. :)"", 'Love your game but please here me out and for all the fans out here. So everytime you guys host tournamen are dinosaurs always need to regenerate. Witch is very annoying. Please make it better. Like Jurassic world alive for example. When your dinosaur gets defeated you can always try again without cashing them back in a battle. Also can we pls get new dinosaurs??. An alliance would sound great as well where u can chat to your friends.. and help each other level up and unlock new dinosaurs', ""So the game was honestly better I it's earlier stages, one reason being that most dinosaurs were generally earned in the main battles, now they're all events, second off money, it's easy to earn dollars but threes not much to spend them on, next I also like how you used to get a dinosaur for each main story battle, now you either get DNA every two battles or some times a possible new or duplicate dinosaur which sucks and make the game too slow, also everything is unlocked at too high of a level"", ""It's a very good games. Everything is good but there was also a problem, there will be a black color background for a longtime when I start the game. And I need to delete and download the game again, only I can restart the game. Pls solve this problem...."", '(Updated 02/19) Dropped from 5 stars to 1 after dealing with customer service. The day before my game glitched out I spent $100 on in game content and due to my game error the rewards I spent went towards nothing beneficial essentially being a waste.

The game just loads forever and gives me the basic rewards.', ""I enjoy the game. Literally every time I load the game there's a 500+MB update. It takes me 20mins to load the game because of it. I would rate it 5 stars if this wasn't a problem"", ""Honestly fun game but once u get a little ways into it if ur a free player like me it takes way too long to progress. U need dna to get any dino and it starts off fine but once u start getting hybrids the cost is just too high and the quickest way to get dna is ads. U get 50 per ad to a point then its 10 a ad. So when ur talking 20k dna for 1 dino and ur only getting 50 a ad its not fun at all so have stopped playing and probably won't be coming back unless this changes (which it won't bc money)"", 'Another ""pay to win"" game as far as PvP goes with free players going up against overpowered bought dinos. Resources don\'t last long and the amount of ads to push you to pay the ridiculous VIP price is spam level.

In the previous Jurassic Park game the cenezoic animals were given regular paddocks like the dinosaurs. Now they're all relegated to one building. The same goes for the aquatic animals."", 'It is a fun game with good graphics. I could play this game for hours but it crashes almost every 5, 10 minutes. The game requires excellent internet connection.', 'Overall the game is good, but when i went to the free cash section i did 2 of them and got nothing.it. ether said. Error has accorded, or you can no longer do this one try another one.plz fix soon.', 'Nice graphics and animations perfect for a person that loves dinos but it is difficult for a non vip player like me its hard to get dna the team should give non vip players some more dna and vip players more than b... e.... f.. o.... r... e ok', ""Everytime I load up the park, the screen would always freeze for second and turn black and later on I'm on my lock screen, and having to unlock everytime I enter the game or win/lose a battle"", 'I like everything about it. But if you could make like a template when it come to moving things around. Like clash of clans. Also somethimes tapping on building some requires 2 taps and it really annoying.

Great overall game.', 'i think this game is amazing! i wish there was a wider variety of dinsoaurs to choose from also that you could make more hybrids. like Monosaurus, a monolophosaurus and Tyranosaurus mix.

Thank you Ludia,coming to this game from War Robots by pixonic and by far is so much more free to play and fun"", ""While you do wait a lot if you go the free of paying way, it's still fun and you can still get to even rare or super rare dinosaurs without much problems.

I'm not doing that again. What's the point in playing if updates wipe progress in this manner. Not worth the effort. Very annoyed but I guess to be expected."", ""It is a great game to break up the day of all the stress of being good at things. Problem solving and making a colony is just a fun experience. The best is that this game has death in it. As is in real life. You can revive people but....To me its a better way of showing that if you don't take care of your people. They die. It is a challenging game. I enjoy it."", 'My favorite mobile game! Not a big fan of the series I admit but this game is great, it can be difficult when you start your vault but once you get about 30 people in your vault and start doing quests, and wasteland exploration it gets really fun and always stays interesting for months. I think the first time I downloaded the game years ago I built a vault for like 6 months and even had 100 people.', ""I think this game is fun. It has quests that you can do and you can get outfits and weapons to fight with on quests. You Can even make BABIES! (Living Quarters). You can place different men or women in different rooms like Power, Food, and Water. (Diner, Water Treatment, and Power Generator I believe). You can also heal your dwellers in the medbay. Also Take their radiation away in the science lab I believe. Don't think so. You can take them out in the wasteland to find caps, weapons and Outfits"", 'I really love it, but I think a rationing system would be cool. Kinda like the Oregon Trail. Plentiful meals make people happier and healthier. Sufficient meals would be basic. Reduced would make people unhappy, but it makes your food counter go down slower. Same could be said for water and power. Maybe power could be sent to other places by command when low enough instead of random ones. I would just like the resources not to be all gone when I come back from my dinner.', ""This game is the best ,this is my opinion ,but please make some updates add some monsters to the game make new challenges new rooms i don't no ,maybe make some harder monsters ,create some new turrets that we can put them on the volt doors ,new guns ,new clothes ,make it online so we can play with others or so we can see their base ,maybe add some new tasks ,this game is so good ,its very sad to leave this game like that without updating it"", ""Great game! But i'd recommend to any new players DO NOT do the final Bottle+Cappy quest, as your phone will pretty much crash everytime you boot up the game about 2-3 mins into playing. Bottle very rarely drops quantums, kinda good early on, but 2yrs in... :/ When you have built up 50+ dwellers you will come to hate them! The song plays, the game lags and you will have to reboot. Sooo annoying! They should add an option to turn these guys off/on. <3 a veteran fallout player"", ""Been playing for over a year now have everything maxed out but the rad scorpion attacks are completely ridiculous. It takes me like 10 minutes to kill one and all my shelter people have 16+ attack weapons. When you are under a random attack your power drains which isn't a problem becuase I have such a big shelter but it's ridiculous. I have a ton of power and 1 scropion can bring it into danger mode. Love fallout and this game is okay but it's very very tedious and can be very annoying at times"", ""Great game, but please make the mysterious stranger easier to find. Please offer more brightly colored and futuristic themes to craft. Also, if you have already found a piece of a theme or a recipe please take it out of rotation so you don't find it again. After you have found all of the recipes and theme pieces, then you could give extra caps for them. Cappy is great but the bottle is hard to see, and he never dances. Please make him a brighter color and dance more."", ""I really like this game. It cool how it is but I would really like it if the pets were more involved. Maybe we could upgrade them? Train them? Also, I never understood the reason for having the option to kick people out of the vault. I think it would be interesting if maybe the dwellers could become contentious, unruly, or even fight if they were unhappy. It would add just a bit more of a challenge to makes sure that they are happy. Those are my considerations but over it's a good game."", ""Unoptimized. In an age where we have tall aspect ratios and curved corners on displays (for the last few years now) this game is insanely unoptimized to fit these types of displays. On my Pixel 4 XL the whole bottom when in landscape shows my apps on my home screen, the corners are all square and are cut off by the curved screens. It's unfortunate Bethesda only puts the effort into optimizing iOS devices. Shame, really."", 'One of my all time favourites. It has a great setting and amazing gameplay. Please devs if you see this consider these changes. 1. The ability to team with other players vaults. Allowing trading, Co-op questing and importing materials (including radaways and stims). 2. Maybe some kind of story line. Giving players a goal to work towards! 3. More rooms. Once you get 100 dwellers your out of things to build and have little reason to expand your vault. All in all, great game. Would recommend.', 'Exceptional. The gameplay is really stable. Never have any issues with lags or bugs really. There is one problem. Upon opening the app before you get to load the vault a ""dead spot"" on the screen shows up in the top part of the phone. Does not appear in gameplay. I will remove this and give a more premium review once it\'s adjusted.', ""This game is fun! I love the way this game was made, and it actually has some resemblance of the original game (fallout 4 ) I also like the ability for us players to customize our dwellers. It's game that is suitable for players who are finding a good game. And the favorite thing I like this game is that I can play it offline! Keep your good work Bethesda!"", ""Excellent game to sink a lot of precious time into. Graphics are decent for what it is. The only criticisms I have are that the touch screen controls make it a little difficult to issue specific commands and that the game makes things difficult for you if you insist on not spending any money (like myself). Also the game might be a little hard on weaker batteries, but that's a very minor gripe. Still a great time waster like I said."", 'Great game but theres still a problem. I had a dweller exploring and I called her back. I waited for 6 hours and there was 2 hours left for her to return. I accidentally touched the explore button so I immediately touched the recall button again. But the time has been reset. It became 8 hours again! I am so, very, extremely frustrated. Please fix this.', 'This game is not that bad. In the regular mode, you can thrive really easily and that is fine. The issue is it drives my LG K40 up the roof now since i have to many dwellers. In the ""survival"" mode it clearly states that the game will get more difficult. The issue with this is literally not even 10 minutes go by without a fire going in the barracks and setting all the rooms a blaze and then people die. Survival mode is hard because the random disaster is spiked to a 10. More fire, more death.', ""I just started this game yesterday and the game is fine. I just wish that you didn't always have to be there 24/7 to ensure your Dwellers are okay if water goes down because most people don't have time to wait every 3 minutes to claim water or electricity or Radaways to get rid of radiation poisoning. I wish that every time you claim it after being offline for a while, they produce as much stuff as they were working for before. Might uninstall."", ""Ive been playing intermittently for a few days now. I like the overall layout for the user. Understanding game mechanics is fairly easy. Caps are earned at a fair rate so expansion does't happen very quickly w/o the purchases. I found it hard to use the touchscreen, so I have been using my mouse to make selections. My tablet/laptop works fine with other apps, but this one can be finnickey at times. I imagine as I keep playing I will find it easier to expand and reduce upkeep of vault members."", ""I love this game, mostly because I play the other Fallout games on the Xbox. This game would get five stars if the game was a faster pace because for me the only people I currently get are from the lunch boxes and you can only get lunch boxes from doing objectives and I almost never get objectives with lunch boxes for rewards. So creators if you're reading this review then please make more objectives with lunch boxes as rewards for completing them. If you do then I'll give this game 5 stars."", 'Reminds me of the original ""Fallout"", except for the lack of 1st person shooter action. Is almost totally about building your shelter and shelter population up. Could do better with some tutorial(s) when you first start out. Is hard when you first start out to figure out the right balance of rooms. Should have some tutorials.', 'love the concept but has major flaws. the sizing of rooms is a nightmare. they are super tiny and when you zoom in the game constantly auto adjusts. clicking on people and moving them is often super difficult. and scrolling arond your bunker ogyen insdvertantly causes dwellers to swap rooms. uses alot of battery on your drvice as well. othetwise a nice game', ""Just had it for a day, fun so far. However, on my Samsung s40 the cola bottle in the top right is cut off slightly from the screen. Also wish the ui for a raider attack was better, I have a few guards that I keep having to find if they stop fighting, not misclick, and hope they reach the raiders before they've moved on"", 'This is a fun game. I really enjoy designing my vault and the quest system. My one complaint are the controls. To zoom in and out you swipe open or close thumb and finger, but if you touch any dwellers on accident, it grabs them instead. Trying to click on dwellers or mystery guy when he appears can be a chore. I have missed many opportunities simply because game does not recognize what you are trying to click on. If mole rats or fire happen, the auto zoom is a nightmare', ""This is so addictive! I love this game. It's easy to play and I love how cheap the lunchboxes actually are! And i totally recommend buying the starter pack. But the great thing is that u can play this game without spending any money at all and still get far. It just takes more time. The only thing I would like to see is maybe some more rooms we can build. Something new."", ""Love it. It is by far my favourite game. But it would be better if u could send stuff to your other vaults you have made. Or if they are on cloud. That's just an idea. To do this you would drag a dweller to the wasteland and press a vault button then there would be your vaults. You would choose one and then select what you wish to send then they would leave with a Brahmin and then yeah that's it. Please add this. Thanks"", 'Yo this game is so much fun that it got me rating this (i dont usually rate apps), there is so many things to do and its not boring at all (only to me i guess). But the only thing i want to be developed in the game is to have more Dwellers coming. But overall, fantastic game! PS: i love that you guys put the mysterious stranger in the game, nice touch', ""Really great game, good graphics, addicting gameplay. Terrible part is that you have to buy lunchboxes after a while, unless you send dwellers out into the wasteland or on quests to get items. Problem with that is I sent a dweller into the wasteland and he only has 3 items for a 5 hour trip. Really annoying, but besides that, it's really fun."", 'Great game, but i have a few suggestions, one is more power armour, and customizable power armor and here is the last one, i know probably for legal reason you cant include this but, please add a Terminator space marine power armor, i know i know you cant because of copyright laws but if you ever do get permission, please add it (and please let it be robust and bulky)', ""This game is pretty addicting, but can be a pain sometimes. Generating power is always a main concern and the scaling for it's minimum level is absurd. It sometimes feels like you're just in a cycle of breeding Strength dwellers to keep up with it. You start rushing, when an incident occurs - a radscorpion... Now you've got to spend the next 5 minutes watching it practically kill all your underleveled, newly-adult dwellers. Just hope you haven't sent your tank dweller on a 9 hour mission."", 'Alright F2P. Fun early/mid game. Timers are on everything (crafting, questing, resources, exploring, training). Seems to have long timers for crafting late game gear (many days-YouTube video). After the early game it seems like not actively playing is a ""good"" strategy (just hop on the game to train dwellers and hop off before some incident occures). Has micro transactions that are NOT micro, but can be ignored. Look up the fallout shelter faq online if you are going to play, it helps a lot.', 'The game is good, brings back memories of the original games and the art style is in the vault tech style which works well. On the down side there are too many disasters and Raider strikes, this upsets the flow of game play, which is essentially micro management.', ""Starting out I almost gave up. This game has a learning curve that can be hard in the beginning. I looked up some tutorials and am having a lot of fun with it. I had the same experience with fallout 4. If I hadn't had that experience first I poetically would have given up. But, I'm glad I didn't."", ""This game is good. Suggestion add a family tree on dweller's profile of those who are born in vault so it's easier trace their family, 2nd make a function on their profile of where you want to assign them because it's hard to drag the dweller from 1 station to another if too far, 3rd to be more human-like give them energy and hunger like the happiness status on their profile. Example if they are hungry they will go to dinner station and if they get tired they will rest at residence."", ""I like it, it's easy to pick up and play, it's addictive, however it could use a few tweeks, the screen sticks at times when I am panning around (which is annoying when looking for the little guy who pops up), I accidently pick up dwellers when I don't want to and the outfits should be able to be used on both sexes but some aren't, and you should be allowed to rearrange your rooms without having to sell and build new ones, apart from that it would be mint."", ""It's a fun game! You are an overseer of your vault and must do everything to manage your dwellers' happiness and health. Tips: 1)Finish building your three main resource buildings and fully upgrade them first, then you can have better understanding on what to build for other building. 2)Put 1 or 2 dweller(s) out for exploring and equip them 5-8 med and radaway overnight. 3)Get 3 person to wear your strongest clothes and weapons to do some harder missions, it'll be so easy to go through them."", ""I love how each individual character can be easily cheered up by dragging and dropping them to specific rooms, yet it baffles me how when there's an attack on the vault it takes much longer to select them to fight? I also found that out of the 50+ Dwellers I have every one of them became miserable when I assigned them as guards? ü§î"", ""It's good for the first few hours but as soon as you start to build up your vault enemies walk through like it's nothing.

SO VEEY DISAPPOINTED I just cant understand why some game need a connection when there is NO other player on the map. Its should not require a data connection.. I enjoy the update and I also have not freely available but not always . And when no internet I like playing this game but now I'll probably just delete it and free up my space on phone.. i dont keep many apps game on phone but most of them are all no internet"", 'So there are updates but have not seen any achievement upgrades yet.', 'quits the game every minute since the last update', 'One of the worst money grab "" free games "" ever. You simply reach a point where you can go no further or gain anything without spending money. Designers were smart enough to make the game enticing until you realize it is a dead end without spending. Wish I could give it minus stars.', 'Good game with very nicely designed interface. Think probably a game to dip into and mess around with on a long term basis. Unfortunately seems to have been abandoned by developers, with no updates for 3+ years and support/ news buttons which do not work (otherwise would give 4 or 5 stars)', ""True it is hard to advance as free to play but it isn't impossible. There are a lot of things that don't make sense but as long as you dont take it too seriously the game is a fun thing to poke around on. I would like to see expansions. It seems that G! could do so much more with this game with very little effort. Sure it is a money suck but they probably lose a fair amount of players due to the difficult advancement, especially early on. and the lack of diversity and growth of the game. PVP would be fun too (Fantasy Pros style)"", ""Also it would be great if you can add 3 more options to the control center. 1. Resources available, 2. Vehicles to be repaired, 3. Crafting window. Acquiring each city is very difficult. Takes too much time. I thought I was badly addicted and didn't Saw a way out. Now I lost interest and got Free from addiction. Not playing this game anymore. Just wondering whether I should uninstall or not."", ""Their system glitched when I purchased gold and gave me extra gold so it blocked me from joining their weeklies. I contacted their support team and they have told me that I have to create a new email account and they will transfer my purchases and that means I start from the very beginning of the game. Don't download this game they have a very bad support system, the support button in the game doesn't even work. It doesn't even deserve 1 star."", 'I played this game before and had a lot of fun with it. However I recently downloaded the onto a new device. When I try to sync my new device with my past progress, it will not sync. I hit the button for support and the page that appears has no way to contact support on it. So therefore the one star rating will stay until the issue is fixed.', 'Changes from older versions give new things to do and now include parts you need to build your vehicles. But therein lies the rub. You need five links to build the Mogul but each link takes eight screws. You need three ropes to build a Leviathan airship, and each rope takes seven screws. But you only get one free basic box of five parts every four hours and can build one basic box per hour (or oddly only three boxes in five hours at level 2). The length of time it will take to land 40 screws for the Mogul and 21 more for the Leviathan is crazy. I have had the same two quests or missions or whatever you call them for several days now and I am nowhere close to getting enough screws to build a thing. If you want to include parts, awesome, but give a player some control over what parts he manufactures. Building cogwheels when you have no immediate need for them is absurd, while your need for nuts and screws takes weeks to satisfy.', 'Support is non existent, every time i try to connect for support, it is ""inaccessible at this time"" and to ""try again later"" Could be a fun freemium game, but the care just isnt there. Constantly crashes on startup, slow, laggy gameplay. Its the little engine that couldn\'t.', 'Just another trap to keep you glued to your device. Click to collect, click to build, click, click, click...and years later you wake up from this trance with a long gray beard and potbelly. Not for me, thanks.', ""The game won't open"", 'Fun for awhile, but the further you progress the longer it takes to receive needed resourves. Timers get so long they exceed 24 hours.', ""Dreadful game! Almost impossible to progress to next level. Complicated interface and it's taken over 35 hours of play to build the first airship. Times for basic stock too long, upgrading very complicated, need to buy a LOT of gold to make any progress."", 'Fun Game. BUT! No longer supported, by the designers. Level 45 is maxed.', ""Good game, but... I'm playing this game for many years now, since 2015 I think, not fanatically but still I have long way to finish it. No updates since long time ago and no new special events. Do something!"", 'Game is very hard to advance on unless you spend ¬£¬£¬£ on it, it does say ingame options to spend from ¬£1.99 to ¬£99.99, I have spent just under ¬£5.00 and now I can not advance any further, this game is good but needs your money.', 'Played this game for Many years now. At level 40 just this month. I have loved the years of gameplay and fun I have had from this game! Thank You for a great game.', 'Good game. Rewards needs to increase on completing task or other thing. Resources get depleted very fast. Not able to convert to infinite resources even though sufficient manager are there. Need this correction', ""Like others have noted, the game requires a lot of patience as you wait for parts unless you spend actual money. I also noticed that parts sometimes disappear from inventory. At first I thought I wasn't paying enough attention when repairing carriages, so I have been double-checking each time I use parts to build or repair. Sure enough, I'm short on valves, linkages, etc. Very disappointing, and if that keeps happening I'll probably stop playing. It's a shame, though, because I've enjoyed all other aspects of gameplay, even the translated English dialogue."", 'If you construct the wrong building, it can not be torn down. This is a huge problem since it might make it impossible to continue the game play. Further more, the in-game support is not working.', 'This is really wonderful mind opening game I played in 2004, 2005 when It comes on CD for desktop.. I really love this and hard but interesting', ""This game is fun at first and has tons of potential. However, as you play it becomes horribly redundant as you search and scrape for parts and silver. For example, I've reached a level to unlock a new area but it's a total pain trying to reach the 60k silver or 100 gold required to unlock it. Every time I reach 45k silver, it drops to 30k because it's needed elsewhere to keep the game running. The cost in resources, silver, and parts are extremely unbalanced and too high. That prevents you from using things like airships to their potential. I'd love to see this game become more playable by balancing costs better."", 'Need more gold. Got to a point in the game where I want to upgrade the warehouse but in order to do that i have to upgrade the administration but in order to do that i need more material than I can store in my warehouse. And there are no ads to watch to earn gold bars. üëé', 'This game wanted access to media files etc etc and does Not explain why. Far too risky in this age of wall to wall spyware, malware and Christ knows what else viruses are out there. Not worth taking a chance', ""Starts off kind of fun, but quickly turns into long waits to do anything, unless you want to pay to play. That's all this game seems to be about, especially considering all the ads that bombard you when opening the game. From reading the other comments, this seems to have been a fun game previously, but pay to play has ruined it."", 'Over all gameplay is decent. The primary issue that I have with the game is that any items left on screen when another dialog pops up our lost rather than being added to your stores. For example, when I tap to finish a contract for steel, and it levels me up, the level up dialog causes all the steel to disappear and is not added to my total in my warehouse. This glitch has caused me to lose a lot of resources over the course of playing the game.', 'I absolutely love this game! With me knowing a lot about locomotives, this is a good game.', 'Is this game at the end of its life? I have played the game almost daily for over 4 years now and have gotten to a point in the game where i can not advance. Shame as it is a great game, I have spent money on this in the past but no longer can find myself supporting a dead game that is no longer being developed', ""It's a very nice game but there's a problem loading is way too slow could you please speed up loading time other than that it's a good game"", ""This game looks quite good but it will soon makes you feel bored. Two years without any update, well, it's no longer interesting or special anymore. Yeah, 4 üåü for a game like this though its graphics are cool. Again, the gameplay is just okay as well as the storyline and nothing more."", 'very interesting game at first. but when start to continue the game after the tutorial, i found it start to be boring. too long to wait for mining resources, and too difficult for upgrade or build things (my quest just need to build residence home that need many resources and until now, look still too far to go). if you put less time for collect stuff and less hard to progress i think i will stay to play.', 'Really disappointed that Devs appear to have forgotten the Android version of this game. No updates in 3 years on this platform, but pay through other platforms and several updates', 'Can\'t even start the game even after I downloaded it keeps on saying ""download error""', 'A waste of time, over complicated,the daily rewards are a total lie, often gives lesser rewards than stated,and you really need to spend money to actually advance in the game, there are far superior sims out there, even the support function is a lie', 'Was really liking the game... Untill I looked at data use. 2 weeks and over 2 gig of data used. Install and updates on wifi, few adds watched. Have no idea how it can use so much data. A full gig in just background data. Avoid if not on wifi 24/7. :(', 'Another ""money for the makers"" game, not for the player = frustrating unless you keep spending $real.', ""I don't know if you quit supporting this game or what I got a new phone and I have my old account it shows when I first start playing asking if I want to restore it but when I click on it NOTHING happens after a while it will pop up again and ask if I want to restore it and again I click yes but nothing happens clicking on the support button also just brings up a window that says loading and again nothing happens I used to love this game but I don't want to restart from the beginning"", 'could not quit or swap apps. had to go to phone settings to force crash the app to close. also forces you to download 150mb without warning after installing the 80mb app. cant stop that and just lost that data... and my month just started... stupid app. game just constantly tells you what to do. no freedom.']"

So, overall, good game, and support seems likely to help if you have any issues."", ""I've played this game many times on many different phones/devices. It always has me playing it again for some reason. However I've noticed there's still no confirmation on gold purchases. I lost 20 gold ( not a lot obviously ) to a purchase in an event. The fact that it was a purchase in an event makes it worse because the purchase will vanish with the event. Please add a confirmation for gold purchases"", ""Broken ads mishap.. Most ads goes for twice as long before, why? After an ad, you get an additional 30 sec count down and even that, sometimes it doesn't work. As in, you go back to the game and have to watch yet another ad because what you seen before didn't matter. Especially when claiming angels. I wind up watching two or three ads just to claim?

And no matter what they say, the 'angel investors' don't give you that much boost. You basically end up BELOW were you where before and then it gets slow again and you have to reset it again. Don't see what's the point of doing it over and over again. Not worth to spend a single cent on the so called gold and anything they promote to boost your score. Like all of those 'idle' game it's purely design to make you spend money for USELESS addons and make you watch ads without giving back anything meaningful in return. Moreover, their so called 'special events' suck big time, overrun with fakes and bots and they don't give you any time boost after upgrading.

However, sad to report that if you ever uninstall your game for any reason (such as the game malfunctioning and needing to reinstall), you WILL lose every bit of progress. With all the unlocks and progression I had, it was disappointing to have to start over, so I stopped playing. Progression info should really be saved to accounts/cloud based, not stored in local files that gets deleted on uninstall. The below reply from developer is good to know, since games will be saved moving forward, but my game data was still lost since cloud sync was not a thing at the time of uninstall, so my saved games were not backed up.

Ive been having trouble with the Green Farm app so I switched farm games. The reason I rated this app only 4 stars was because while this game is fun, there are some glitches every time I open the app (online or offline).

Why does it have to take 7hrs to make a shovel?', 'Graphics are cute. It\'s a relaxing game. Takes a lot of time to level up and expand without spending money, That\'s not a good thing.

One every 15 munutes is hardly enough especially if you consider the size of the orders involving water crops. It makes something that should be fun...stress!', ""I really enjoy the game but, there are technical issues you need to fixed with the boat race.

It's still a good game to play and kill time but not a game to play if you think you can get far in without buying anything. F2P players have been left out in the current game status and has focused more on P2P players. I've bought over 1 million gems over the years and i have trouble keeping up with current P2P."", 'This game is very nice but if you grind for like a month or two you could get the Same result with 30-50 bucks in a Day or two', 'Good game with lots of different opportunities and heroes and also a lot of pets to equip to the heroes.

I know this is good for upgrades but come on igg!', ""This is a really fun game but it does have some need for improvement. Make it so you can view a player's clan, heroes, building levels and such when viewing their base. Also having to buy a loudspeaker to chat is annoying just make different global servers.

Forcing such a divide amongst the members. Only the rich now can play this game. How stupid can I be to ever give them another penny.

Game has evolved from a fun team game to a complete money grab. IGG (I Got Greedy) pushed most of the top players out and nobody bothers playing the majority of events anymore. No longer fun for me, but you might like it.', 'The Game is great. One of the games i liked very much. Ive been playing it a long time and i am a f2p player. There is a lot of ""limited time offers"" in the game and they all change every release of it, but if you releases ""spend gems for packs"" its all the same.

This is a well rounded strategy game with lots to do and ways to do it. The only issue I take with this game is IGG's dishonest, gamble riddled pay to play tactics to keep you hooked. How IGG is able to bypass Internet Gambling Law is a mystery to me but I'm sure will catch up to them someday."", ""Lol as I said 2 years back after playing since almost the start... this game is dying. Less than 100k active players I would guess and it's all because of the lack of public listening. New heroes are double the strength of older ones and nothing gets balanced ( to improve strategy gaming) it's all about who buys the new guy first.

I really hope theres a second one or an expansion of sorts soon.', ""Very cute game, easy to understand, and intuitive controls. It's a tower defense game but it does have a unique take on it. Def worth the money to buy it."", 'There has been a glitch where the enemy damages my team but my team cannot damage the enemy which resulted in having to start over. I also agree that the font is too small. Perhaps, a greater contrast with the background would help.', ""It's still a new game for me but it's super fun! It reminds me of the tower strategy games except it's with a mobile team you can customize and take pride in üòÖ‚ù§Ô∏è I'd recommend it, it should help on a 5 hour bus ride too"", 'So far it is really interesting and fun, drawing from some very familiar TD mechanics, but adding new spins on it in the form of a ""moving tower"" if you will it is a lot of fun', ""Reminds me of tower defense games like Kingdom Rush but with a twist. Your main object is to escort your main player to the end of the road. Along the way are waves of enemies which you can fight off from spawning guardians around your main piece. Easy to learn buttons, very enjoyable and strategic. Any defence tower fans out there I highly recommend you guys try this out. There's no pay to win or gacha shops, everything is obtainable from hard work. Good Luck!"", 'Game is really fun but all of the things happening on the screen at once (ie: balloon enemies popping) cause the game to lag.', 'Pretty fun but is hard to touch the elements in the screen since the art is so tiny. It works fine on my Pixel 2 but not with my Huawei wide screen device', 'Super fun variation of tower defense. Cute graphics and fun gameplay. Controls can get a bit tricky when you have many heroes.', ""Overall I enjoyed the game. Only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because the text is tiny in some places and it studders sometimes during combat."", ""Not bad. It's like if Kingdom Rush and Battleheart met and had an adequate, albeit unspectacular, child. It's not as polished or strategic as Kingdom Rush and not as smooth and action-packed as Battleheart. But those two are among the best Android games of all time so Tiny Guardians is still pretty decent."", ""Fantastic game! Got it through the Play Subscription on a whim and I've been addicted ever since! Gameplay is challenging but fun, graphics are cute, love it!"", 'Well, the UI is tiny and characters randomly just stop being able to target enemies which forces you to restart the level. This conveniently happens at the end of the level pretty often. So, nope.', 'This is great game,so much fun,great repitable content. Love it <3 just need to be bit longer :) we need more world to explore ;)', ""A great new take on tower defense, and very challenging! Adorable characters, plus endless puzzling over the best group composition. I'm hooked."", 'Great game, especially with play pass! Easy to play in short bursts, but you can just keep playing for hours!', ""Super fun and it's free so why not. Multiple difficulties for different challenge levels."", ""Really fun game but the UI is not good on the phone. When a banner comes up to rate the game you have to exit the game entirely because there is no button to exit out of the banner. A lot of the other text is stacked on top of each other so you can't read it."", 'Fun game. Writing is too small with little contrast. Makes it hard to read', 'I love this game! However, I think there needs to be an option to make the interface and UI bigger. It is hard to read.', ""I'm using a new Galaxy Tab S5e and the game stutters and lags. It's fun and worth playing but the experience is disappointing at times."", ""Fun game, tho I can't read a thing due to the sizable black bars on the sides of the screen. It's almost like it isn't scaling to full screen correctly."", ""Kinda short but really fun, once I beat it the screen keeps popping up about rating the game and I have to reset the game everytime is the only problem I've had."", ""So far so good. Quite enjoying the game. It's something different but also similar to the average TD games"", 'Amazing game I loved the first couple but this one is so much better!', 'Awesome game! Quick response and help from the Devs :)', 'Definitely a refreshing twist on the tower defence genre!', 'Amazing game story, stragedy gameplay, and i love the art style! A beatiful game no doubt.', ""Very fun game changing but not to hard. Great game let's see some more."", ""Loving the game so far, however I'm confused as to why when I want to connect to Google Play Games it wants access to my Google Drive?"", 'Only complaint I have is a lot of text is way to small.', 'Nice art layout everything feels and runs smooth.', 'Tower defense with a twist. Lots of fun', 'Doesnt allow fullscreen on Samsung S+ series phones', 'Good game, i like the twist on tower defense', 'Fun a very different game and a super good time. Killer']"

Thanks to read every reviews. Ryuk', ""The game and team play can be great but this is the MOST frustrating game you'll ever play because of the bugs. It locks hourly, and you'll need to reboot if you don't stay on. HUGE waste of time doing this. I would not recommend. I keep playing cos I have a lot of $ invested but wish I'd never started. Plarium give me lame excused for 3 yrs, but no solutions. If you don't have a super fast internet in particular you'll not be impressed."", ""It was really good. Great, lots of people to chat and meet. Then plarium decided the millions they were making wasnt enough, so they add champs, and then stone heart now some other speciality units all geared around the .05 percent of players in stormfall. The coiners( they changed everything to cater to the VIP, that's something like a 1,000 usd a month)! Yep some are way more than that. These players have handlers, there own packages, troops, castle skins. The only reason I still play the game"", ""Platinum always seems to have an excuse for everything. Game has issues yet it must be your device, hmm. Still with the updates and plarium adding more ingame rewards they are taking away other parts no one is paying attention too. In game play is still buy to win or advance with upgrades, if you don't make purchases you are at a dead stand still which is not even close to actual game play, more ways to win rewards does not over weigh the items you took away, so plarium still struggles...."", 'Update 12/23/19 Glitches were fixed. I\'ve again been enjoying the game. 12/22/18 Was good till this last update. all the glitches now make it hard to enjoy. Update 9/3/19 Again they updated one thing & messed up something else. Such a shame since this game is pretty fun. WHEN IT WORKS! Now I have to re-login every few minutes. Very frustrating. And when you report it, they auto answer ""it\'s your device or your wifi""', ""I'm giving this game 5 stars, it has helped me pass the time many times; while living in my small trailer. And the detail on this game is phenomenal... and really stays up to date. & for most part has really giving me hardly no trouble running the game from my phone, you can also use this on your Desktop Home Computer."", 'With so many countries playing game it would be a big help if server would either add a langauge translator or allow a app to open up when a foreign player sends a message so we can communicate with each other. That would be a upgrade worth installing to use in the game.', 'What the hell, the game will only load until ""Catching Dragons"" and hold for like 30 minutes Edit: Thank you, the advice was sound ad helpful Edit: Good Afternoon, it seemed the same problem as before is happejing again, the load time is always on ""Catching Dragons.""

And just to build up army is BOOOOOOE√àEERING ... Make it at least smaller build up time .... even to build up Pickman is taking ages ....', 'Good game, better version than the one on Facebook, in my honest opinion. Laggy as hell though, can\'t play as much in one go, due to the sheer number of times I have to restart the game because of ""No connection, check your internet"" .

You spend money in the game and the you can't even log into your account for days or even weeks. The updates are getting worse, more and more people continuing to have trouble. The August update took almost 6 weeks to get corrected to be able to log on correctly, this one is several days in. This used to be a great game, but is well beyond its peak. Very frustrating, a lot of time and money has been spent!"", 'Finally after the most recent update the game is returning to a playable state. The only glitch I still see remaining is that players Avatars/Icons are not appearing correctly and Alliance Tags are showing incorrectly frequently. I am happy to see Plarium working hard to fix the bugs that have been plaguing the game and ruining the experience for those who love the game. Get rid of the league attack feature and make beacons and forts worth holding again and I may consider a 5 star rating.', 'Haven\'t been able to log in for over a month now. Hoped the new update would help, it didn\'t. Support is a waste of time, nobody\'s listening. Been playing this game for years now, probably time to move on, shame. V.2.03.3 is the update I tried.

Edit- I have upgraded to the latest version. 2 weeks ago! Guess what? Still unplayable with constant logins required. Update 09/10/2019. After update I take one in game action and guess what! Login required! This is officially ridiculous. About 6 weeks ago you guys broke something. Edit 9/18/19 - reinstalled twice, still requires re-login. Out of 8 attempts to connect per day on average it connects me once, maybe twice.', ""Unreal the problems this game continues to have....placed top 25 in raids but yet when I checked stats, I was maxed and #1 was 250k behind me. The banking system on bgs is jacked up. You throw all the troops you win, you get payout, then you throw all the troops in your castle and still no payout....I earned almost 600k in league brawl so it's not like I don't know how to play or what to expect. Overall, more disappointing daily...."", 'The app says new update but, the update is not showing in the play store.
