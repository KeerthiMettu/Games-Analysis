Download the latest update now to get your hands on new content! Time to hit the tables!","[""Great game. You'll love it! UPDATE: When the game doesn't freeze up and lets your opponent win, it's a fun game. It has happened to me numerous times. Be aware!! I want the developer to explain to me how I have HIGH SPEED INTERNET, but yet this game tells me my connection is slow?! Then I make my shot, WIN THE GAME IN PLENTY OF TIME, but yet the game tells me I ran out of time, and my opponent wins the game! This game freaking sucks! If someone doesn't respond to this post, I will take it out."", ""It's a decent game. Not realistic at all. If you scratch, you can place the cue ball wherever on the table you want. Should not be able to cross the line. One reason why I hardly ever play anymore. The game itself is mostly luck, doesnt take much skill. There are much better (realistic) pool games on the app store. Recommend trying one of them."", ""This game has a lot of potential but a couple of serious flaws hold it back. The player synchronization doesn't always work. I've made shots only to have them be reset saying I ran out of time. The other flaw is the never ending steam of pop-ups between games that want you to spend real money on a game that's not ready for prime time. If you want me to spend real money, make sure I won't lose because of a time sync error. Until then, I'll keep playing for free despite the annoying ads."", ""The glitchiness is getting ridiculous. I lost 3 tournaments because of the static movements. Plz fix it. I might be forced to find a pool game by another developer. (Update)! Well. I updated. The carnival feature isnt there in my version. Dont know why im posting this as nobody cares to respond to anyone's complaints. You are stupid ,money hungry developers . You forgot about making the game fun. ( 2nd update). Uninstalling. Sick of the bulls***.😠"", ""Gameplay itself is okay. Unfortunately, when I reinstalled the game after trying it years ago and connected using only my Google account, it automatically displayed my old Facebook name (which is not my name now). There is no option to change display name, and as a trans person that old name isn't one I want every opponent seeing, nor one I want to be forced to see every time I look at the screen. Uninstalling, but would try again if the option to set display name were added."", ""It's a fun game overall, just need some bugs fixed , at times it will say you potted the cue ball when you don't and gives the shot to your opponent, which ends up costing you chips if you lose the match, have lost a lot of chips due to this bug in the game, that's why I give 3 stars, and support doesn't respond to mails I have sent about this issue so poor game support as well"", 'Love this game! I love how you can play people from all over the world! Just everything about this game is great! 💜 i do wish that you had more chances to earn cash and one more tier that you could play for 10k to win 20k without calling shots everytime. 😊 thanks for making this amazing game though! It keeps my mind occupied for hours and hours!', 'I love this pool game . No other pool game can equal this app. One thing its missing is MA SE. The one shot you hit from the top and it makes the ball curve to avoid a bad shot. Hope it would be available . Pls work on it. Thanks miniclip. I recomend this game to anybody. Young , old, male or female. I give it a thumbs up. Chatt A.', ""I have decided on a 1 star because their algorithm is screwed up. They rank me as a level 6 with a random level 141. There are millions of online players but they can't match you with someone your level. The game is broken I hit two perfect shots in the hole but 1 spun in and outward, the second just stopped ON THE EDGE. The game updates every day or so and it takes 5 full minutes of waiting for you to play then. I would not suggest this app to my worst enemy."", 'Review changed to 1 star from 3. I am fed up of the game changing the rules with me. Opponent does not hit rail and I have to take the shot from the spot, I do EXACTLY the same and they have ball in hand!? Also love how they always get fantastic positioning using no spin on the ball which I might add does not work correctly when you do use it ball just goes where the hell it wants. Anyway uninstalled, some advise to players dont buy anything you start to suddenly lose!', ""I'm an avid player of real pool, and this is the best online pool game I've ever played, hands down. It better be, since I spend ridiculous amounts of time on it. Graphics and physics are great, lots of different game styles and table options, excellent social interaction. Highly addicting. Need I say more?"", ""Love the game itself. There are some changes that need to be made though. For example, if someone breaks and runs the table all the way out you lose your coins. If someone doesn't even get a shot then how can you say the Victor beat me. I didn't even play but yet I lost millions. With that said if I break and the other person runs out the table to win. Then I did get a shot so therefore I lost. Seems my opinion don't matter."", 'Fun game, but rigged by Artificial Intelligence posing as real players. I can win 10-15 games in a row on a regular table. As soon as a ""Special Event"" opens up that requires an in app purchase to progress through after losing...you cant win not even one match...even against players who are way under ranked. It\'s totally fake!', ""I have gotten good enough at the game to notice some things. If you are not paying real money, it will do things like force you to scratch, or make the ball roll longer than normal to hide your shot. I also see that sometimes coins are reduced slightly higher than the bet. If you dont pay attention, you wont notice. I still have to watch the advertisements. I understand they have a business, but they still make money off the adds when you dont pay for stuff. It's not as fun when getting screwed."", ""Bad Experience Dear developer, Please have a look at the recent update of the game, and check its impact 1. See the Graphics of Previous Version, it was very good, it did'nt required changes at all...! 2. Check all the cues, some of them are Not at all visible, they have Gone Transparent...,! 3. And how much money you are expecting from us To pay to You..! We were getting daily 1 cash For free from an year now.. And Now You will get it in 75 hours OmG.... What is Wrong .. please look forward."", 'good graphics. accurate shooting. unfortunately no skill involved. the game is algorithm based. you will win/lose based on your win/lose ratio vs your opponent and based on your last in game purchase vs your opponents as well as other components. there is no telling if you will win or not. ive had balls literally jump out of pockets after going in if it was my turn to lose that game.... but a good way to pass the time. The general rule is you are not permitted to maintain higher than 2/3 ratio.', 'Increasing the win percentage is difficult if not impossible. At times it seems like cheats and bots are abundant. The shot clock, and who gets the break is inconsistent. Shots are blocked or otherwise cheated with when you are making headway. Very frustrating usually. I have notified MINICLIP about these problems and I have not seen any improvement, yet an increase of the number of instances of cheats. I am thinking of not playing anymore.', ""Absolutely love it, I do t know how many times I've uninstalled it because of loosing all my coins, but I always reinstall it after I go through the 5 stages of grief. This is the only game that I've kept in my phone for years now. Some come and go but this right here is a keeper. Tips: play safe and don't bet too high, if you loose few games take a breather, only play into millions if you can play 10 or more games. I've been using this technique and now I'm into billions..."", ""Chests disappear when I'm opening them because your stupid random pop up ads for premium stuff take priority and close it. I don't know if I still get what's in the chest or if it's just gone. Fix this. Also, the 'Spin and Win' is totally rigged, you never get the good stuff on the wheel. Otherwise this is a fun pool game and I play it most days."", 'Constantly getting robbed!!! The daily minigames of spin and win never t you get more than 250 coins. Ever. And I bought the poolpass and it didnt give me 4 of the boxes. Lately it also freezes. Will be deleting soon. Which sucks cuz I really like it. Also the free coins every 4 hours has been frozen for 1.5 days. Just not happy.', 'I tried this game because my nephew recommended it and was instantly hooked. I have been playing for months now. There are always new challenges, graphics and sound effects are great, ads are reasonable (they allow you to earn coins, which you need to play in higher levels), and although you are constantly invited to pay for higher options, it is perfectly possible to have hours of play without paying anything. I wish it was possible to switch off notifications of what friends are online.', ""Too Many Cheaters on here. Some of you gamers really piss people off when you intentionally place balls and make your competitor hit them knowing they will miss. Your team need to fix fixed games. Every game I have played for the past 4 days I'm scratching every game. Certain red circle positions should make the the ball stop and it's not doing that. People with high grade cue sticks should only play with other high grade cue users. Some gamers around the globe take forever to continue."", ""Went to the offer wall and went by the rules. They don't give pool cash. Game is fine but stay away from offerwall. You can not call or email. Stay away. The offer wall. They will look only to rip you off after you sign up with dollar shave club. I have a seizure disorder and they just keep telling me it's not enough information"", ""+ points :- Millions of people playing, makes it fast finding an opponent Pretty accurate physics of the game including spin - points :- If you've added 20 friends in this app then it will take 20 clicks to accept all their gifts Etc when you start up the game. Hints:- I prefer 'tap to aim' & horizontal power bar... Try these settings to determine if you like it."", ""The game is just awesome. I can't live even a singal day without playing 8 ball pool. But , I got a problem in recent days. I just updated my android version from 8.1.0 to 9.0 The 8 ball pool is running so slow with breaks of milliseconds. I don't know how to fix the problem. I am just regretting after to update android version of my phone. Kindly provide feedback."", 'Game is very good and enjoyable, ball behaves quite like in real life. Suggestions: add some restrictions like if cue ball is stuck to another, you can hit it with lowest spin as if there is no other ball. Also, add some restrictions, like 3 faults = lost game, or something, there are players who ruin the game by not wanting to hit the ball if it would bring them bad position after that hit. Keep up the good work!', ""The good: Ball spin and reaction is very similar to what is possible on a real pool table. If you are a true billiards lover you will be addicted to the game. If you don't know much about pool, it can be a great game to use as a teaching/learning aid. The bad: If you are really good at the game, it makes it almost impossible for you to get good prizes unless you absolutley work your ass off to get them. The tournaments should be called pocket on all shots, sloppy pool is no fun."", 'Good fun game playing action against real people rather than a computer. Controls at time a little too sensitive, and top cues of cause require real money purchases, so will take you a while to build up a bank of coins to get a fairly decent cue. All in all fun to waste away those quite times if you have nothing better to occupy time.', ""Game is fun. However, when you get a free spin you will NEVER land on anything more than 500 coins. After your free spin they want you to purchase 3 spins. Such a simple thing should free. You may play opponents that aren't active, so you have to wait for their time to expire. If they are inactive you should win be default. Emojis: If you don't have the pass you are limited to what you can say to your opponent. That should be free."", 'Highly recommend this pool game. I really wasn\'t surprised when I found out that nearly everyone I know plays it. The app has lightweight yet smooth graphics, realistic sound effects, many ways to level up as well as improve one\'s game, exciting seasonal challenges, two very different ways to play off-line to practice shooting, etc, etc, etc. I have been ""shooting pool"" with this app for a long enough time to know that it will be around for a very long time.', ""Spectacular! Love it, LoVe It, LOVE IT! Play friends, play strangers, play people all over the world! Very fun, very exciting! My boyfriend and I both play and when we are out at the store or somewhere and people see us playing so many recognize the game immediately! It's so popular and it's obvious why! It's a great game! Thanks 8 ball..."", ""Ya its a pretty good game and if i had the cash it takes to get the good sticks and become a pro id beat everyone out there ...ok well maybe not..it turns out there's some pretty good players on this app ..but I'm having fun and doing pretty good except that once in awhile I'll get a solid ball confused with a stripe ball or vise versa..other than that the game is great and I will recommend it to my friends..."", ""I like playing pool so this game is alright, but I also notice that it will cheat you also. You could have a direct shoot at the hole and miss, and watch someone else do the exact same shoot and the ball go tight into the hole. And that right upper corner shoot is so messed up I have the hardest time with it so I do everything I can not to take a shoot in that direction. Also the rules are stupid, if you shoot and the cue ball hits the next ball of in your bunch, that's all you have to do."", 'I updated my review to one star because there are times when I make my shot, it will go to my opponents turn and give him the chance to win the game. In most instances, he does. When playing high stakes, makes the game bad. Also I am not getting my winning coins after winning the game. That happens all the time. I will not be purchasing anything ever unless the issue is fixed. Please fix.', ""The game is fun however it is difficult to make a good amount of progression without the purchase of the season pass, if you're good enough you'll gradually accumulate alot of coins through games however, the mini games are ridiculous! I have played for 2 years and only ever got 500 coins from the spin and win!"", ""Losing games because of someone else's connection? Yep. I have lost multiple tournaments and games where I was about to win, in the middle of my turn, I am forced to wait for the other player's connection. But when it does reconnect, I lost my turn and lose the game? Time to start looking for a game where I don't get ripped off"", 'I like the lucky shot challenge. No useless ads... I had it 5 stars but I changed it to 1 because the ""spin and win"" the ""boxes"" the ""scratch"" are total Garbage!!! I won 5 ""spin & win"",& I got. 250, 250, 150, 150, 100 coins. Seriously??? I opened a box with Max 200.000 coins, & I got 1000. & the golden spin & win gave me 2500c. Like if it only gives you the lower price every time! Same for the scratches. Fix this issue so it can give also better prices, and then I\'ll change it back to 5 stars.', ""This game is great it's fun to play, and easy in some ways, but it is centered in the offline games category. Also you can't play offline, you can only practice offline, and it has to have a really strong wifi signal. If not it'll just keep loading forever but the weaker the signal it'll pause your game until it gets a stronger signal. Also you only have like 10 seconds to hit the ball if not you'll lose your turn. Please fix this game."", 'Fantastic game with plenty of scenarios to enjoy single play or competitive play. Absolutely no requirement to spend a single penny to have full enjoyment of all aspects of the game from special equipment to tournaments, my favourite game in the store, its simple to pick up and play straight away and extremely easy to enjoy', ""This was my favorite game to play. Very challenging & fun. Its not easy leveling up and winning challenges. Only to be cheated by the game itself. For several months now a $10,000 challenge and win only yields me $3,000. A $2,500 challenge & win yields $600. And $500 gets you $50. WHY? What's up with that? I Have reached out to customer support several times with no response at all. So sad. Fix it and I will give 5 stars. But for now only 1 star for you. My advice play a different pool game.""]"

Thanks for your support everyone, look out for more updates coming soon!
Are you enjoying the game? Leave us a review with your comments.","[""Terrible camera angle on the corners and free kicks! which should be changed as you can't see where the ball is going to go. When your player receives a red card you can't move any other player in the current team around to fill in the gap!. On medium/high graphics the player legs look like sticks, why not lower the graphics on the stadium not the players. Bad idea that you can only play online. Other than that it is a brilliant game. Good passing, crosses, tackling and shooting mechanics"", ""The last 3 years of playing this game was great, I really enjoyed it, but now this update changed everything. I like the manager mode and diamonds, but also this new update really messed up, for example all players have been underrated, don't know why, also my players injure so fast for no reason, I get yellow cards when haven't even slide yet, the narrator's voice has changed. I really want the other version back, and it would be good again."", ""Very good, the problem is to assemble a dream team the transfers don't help and I think it should improve and the haircuts should also improve because the hairstyle makes the players look more similar and has some bugs like the invisible wall, teams are missing Bundesliga and the game has to be updated at each transfer window. However the game is great, I have nothing to complain about."", ""Good gameplay and has good graphics. This is a good football game so this game is for the ppl who like football or play other football games. I rate this very high because its really addictive and very fun. I don't know why people are thinking that this game is bad because its so good that i was addicted to it in a day. It sounds crazy but it happened. Now I'm playing this game when i have spare time. But pls fix so u could search players in the transfer list. Also fix that formations get bought"", ""You can't control your players at all which really annoys me. I could've scored two penalties but my striker decided he wanted to throw it to space. You need to pay gems to give your team a custom badge and custom kit but with these broken controls I can't even get through one game. I was happy to find out that there was a new DLS but this is just terrible. This game should get major fixes. First off don't make us pay gems to customize our team. Second of all FIX THE CONTROLS. This game sucks."", ""DO NOT DOWNLOAD!! You barely control your own players. It's disgusting the further you get into the game its. Not only the players getting worse but the CPU will mess with your control, kicks, the player you switch. And it's not even fun to play anymore. The game of soccer is beautiful one that is ruined by these money grabbing feens."", ""This is actually worse then the previous DLS, you can't train your players, getting Gems is even harder, and you can't scout for new players. Everything looks rushed and to be honest, I prefer old style DLS then this new piece of junk. I hope it can change in the future and if not then there's no point of playing it. I hope the developers can come up with something better then this."", 'The gameplay is cool. who are giving this game 1 star. I have to say them firstly that dls 19 was a game that have many hacked versions. So the authority have to do this for the game improvement. Secondly, the game improves it quality. In real life football, the players were sold before the tournament and for limited time .In this game it is updated to live transfer. So the game improves it reality. And lastly, the game updated many features like you can write the managers name and face.Thanks.', ""I've edited my review a lot of times because I see more and more problems over time. The gameplay is good. Still, the teams in career are very easy to beat. Online mode is improved a lot, there are still some problems where players stop moving for no reason. After division 10, 95% of the players are hackers. Player change sucks. Even if auto change is set to off, it changes when you press the c button the player closer to the ball even if he is behind the ball. Keep releasing updates please."", 'Having been a 2019 version user, this one is slightly improved though the flaws exceed the good of it. 1. You can only play when u have an active net connection, they failed to consider those who play the game using data bundles and not Wi-Fi. 2. The online version is the worst, the app forfeits a game without your consent when starting when you have a string of wins. 3. Some adds are irritating without the forward button to push them out', 'This game is not really amazing as i first thought it would be. I mean its quite painful how the game would be sticking at some points. And very embarassing how the producers would be greedy by setting the game to only play career when you have an internet connection. Sound like a scam to get more from your humble customers to the level that is not really good. I prefer 2019 to be a lot better. Bring it back and compare the differences of the two.', ""Once I got over having to start again from nothing, I found this version to be best of all. There are many smart designs that allow for different avenues to explore without making the game overly complicated. Sound updates are cool, too. Yet, I don't know why players don't refresh/heal between seasons. Nor do I understand how an amateur team could beat Barca - minor issues."", 'Come on guys. This game just has some flaws. For starters, maximum potential is terrible. What happened to being able to max out your favorite players? To go along with that, the inability to search up players is quite annoying. Once these are fixed, my review will change. And, please make the new shooting system optional. We should be able to choose who we use managers on as well. No one wants to upgrade some scrub player on the bench because we cant choose to upgrade our favorite player', ""It's really improved on last year with the gameplay realism and difficulty to build a good team. However, almost every slide tackle I receive, my players gets injured. It makes the game unbearable. It's the main reason it's 2 stars instead of 4. Also a few other things to fix would be: -Crosses are too easy to score with either volley or header -Injuries carry over to next season -Fatigue carries over to next season -Goalkeepers need more animations so they can save better"", ""It is really laggy and everytime I would earn lot of coins in a match and would try to double it by watching an add, the game crashed and I didn't earn any coins. This cost me ranking up a division twice. It is also almost impossible to get good players and afford them now. Overall, this game was a big step in the wrong direction and it reversed all of the things I liked in dreame league 2019. The game just feels so much worse now. I also wish they just had German players."", 'The game is OK. I really wish I could aim correctly. The graphics are ok, not the worse but not the greatest. But I love the game. I like how you can costumize the kits. And, have real players, that you can play in football matches. But, how do you get a ""good"" player, I liked how in the previous DLS there are players that are 50 rated and there is players like 80 rated, But now the highest player I can get is a 65 rated player.', ""I do like it but I got a few issues. The matches are too short, it would be nice to have an option to adjust the length of games, like short, medium, long. And my biggest gripe is with the gold reward system. It's just too miserly and you're stuck in the same division for ages even when you win it because you just don't have enough gold to upgrade your stadium in order to move up because you also needed players earlier. Releasing players should get us some gold and so should winning the title."", ""This was by far the most played game on my phone and exactly what I was looking for in a soccer game. I have played for over a year, blowing up and rebuilding my teams at least 3 times. The fact that all progress has been lost and my previous profile doesn't link means I will not be reinstalling the app. I can't speak to its current updated functionality but throwing longterm users under the bus is deserving of a one star rating. Really unfortunate mostake. * Paying for formations?! Really?"", ""Switching players is still a struggle. Please make the players switching faster, whenever the switch player button is pressed the game must automatically switch to your another player. I also noticed that the game let's you switch your players when the opponent is close if they are far you don't be able to switch to another player. For the rest the gameplay is good. Keep up the good work."", ""The players have major problems, when I try to switch one, it'll switch to a player behind the guy in trying to get, makes them shoot to high, they will often keep their distance from stealing the ball instead, my players are always offsides and it wont make them stay onsides even a little, when goalies kick the ball on their own, they need to kick it to a teammate. The game has many problems with the players but I think it's going to be the best overall."", 'The game is good except that everything is payable now not like its previous versions! A bit of a disadvantage considering the fact that it could have been one of the best football games on portable version. The graphic are awesome but the match commentary has remained unchanged and is monotonous! Needs improvement but is not bad either. Keep it up 👏', ""Have come to realize that when you have worked hard and got the amount of money required to buy big players, they won't appear on market but when you use up the money that's when big players like Messi and Ronald will appear. Then why does everything have to include gems? Really even acquiring formations.. So disappointing"", 'I cant deny that it is a good and full of enjoyful game , but there is a lot improvement that need to be done, first of all , can you change the training or coaches system ,where u can only train your player use the diamond and the worst part it only the player the random player and it always train the player that i dont want secondly , just likethe others said in review , fix the angle movement of player when free kick and penalty , where it is so hard to be controlled', 'Ok. Game was working just fine up until just now. I got full signal Wifi AND mobile data on, but the game states: ""Oops! Your device is having trouble communicating with the server right now. Blah blah"". And I can\'t continue playing online, whereas I have no issue playing other online games at the moment. If this is not fixed soon, or if it ever repeats, this buggy app will be uninstalled and forgotten forever.', 'The game is very smooth and the graphics are really good. The gameplay and the camera settings are really good and better than the previous version. The only thing is the stamina. Maybe the stamina spends coins almost every game because you have to recharge the stamina of the players. Also you could search up the players for the transfers so you more players', ""Perfect gameplay! Transfers are a bit difficult. Why I don't get money when I sell players? Coins that I get per match are very little, please fix this! Player faces are better in the previous version. And the worst, Career Mode needs internet! Please make it offline🙏! Everything else is wonderful! If you fix these things, this will be the best game for Android!"", ""Good job on making this game next to impossible to complete. Micro transactions everywhere. Penalties are completely 💩. Can't even sell players. I've already gotten 10 injuries in 1.5 seasons, just because the CPU slide tackles for fun. Already coins are hard to earn and now in this transfer market, we'll have to pay for an agent just to see the player, and then pay to buy him? Not worth it. Absolute downgrade from the previous versions. Poor excuse of a game."", ""Well it's an awesome game but, as at now when I open the app it doesn't finish loading. It loads to a certain point and that's it, it gets stuck. Also, I think it's a tad too bright. It makes it less realistic. I also think the gems are too difficult to attain and there are more features you could add to it like best player of the season there should be an award given when a player wins most goals and or most assists etc But my problem still stands, as at now I can't access the app at all :-("", ""Recall that I rated 2019 as the worst football game I ever played, I have hugely anticipated DLS 2020 and I must say I am overly overwhelmed with the update! Wow..the online version runs smoothly on good network and I no longer score 30 goals in a game, events are tough and competitive. The only problem is gathering gems and coins...it's too hard to build a team and stadium unless you spend real money. Will appreciate an update on that, thanks."", ""I dont get all the hate. They have paid great attention to detail like the manager kicking the ball back into play and the players looking at the line referee to check for offside. It's hard to make in-game money and to buy players without spending real money or watching a ton of ads but that was an issue they already had in their previous versions...the thing that disappointed me was making the game an online based one..other than that the game is better than its previous versions in every way."", 'I have waited quite a bit of time for this game, but I\'d say it was like a 1 step forward 3 steps back ""improvement"". What I\'m trying to say is that while it improved graphic and gameplay/mechanic wise, it added and removed several things that was just not beneficial. For example: Now have to login using Facebook and no Google Play (why?), new ""gem"" currency that makes the game more of a ""pay-to-win"" one, harder to lvl up stadium and STILL NO IMPROVEMENT on the low-amount coin gain from matches.', ""I've been a fan of DLS since 2014, for me DLS is one of the best mobile soccer games. This one is better than all the previous ones but one major problem for me, the Wi-Fi connection, I'm from South Africa, we don't have soo many Wi-Fi hotspots and data, on it's own is expensive, therefore the internet connection required to do almost everything on the game isn't something I always have at my disposal, which is why I'm giving y'all 1 star"", ""The game looks and feels much better than DLS19. It's more fun to play as shots from range can actually be scored in this game and crosses can actually be effective. Commentary is still poor. The amount of in-game money you have to spend is asking too much of the player. Everything from signing players, to unlocking formations, kits and logos, to increasing the squad size costs money. It all takes too long with the new purple crystal currency. You can't choose specific players to buy/train."", ""I have played DLS for a while now since like 2017 - present. This one is really nice like all the cutscenes and stuff. But what I don't like is that it's like you have to pay to win lol. I like DLS 19 more because it's have more possibilities of upgrading the team. You have to use diamonds to update the team and stuff. The transfers also suck too. I love the one in DLS 19 more. You can't even search for players you wanna sign only wait for the live transfer. Please improve this please!!"", ""The game graphic and gameplay is good but even if u have a strong team u will loose and also the ball passing is not very good...when other teams ball passing techniques are same that don't work for you and also if u win any finals the prize money you earn is same as normal match ..then what is the use of winning a final...apart from this the game is good"", 'Though online version is still laggy. But much better and actually playable compare to previous one. And overall gamepay feels more dynamic now. Thats all for positive. Players made of glass. Literally 1/3 of players are always injured. Always. There are some serious issues with switching players so defending becomes near impossible at times. And players off the ball movement is almost static. Player transfer has also made it kinda worse now.', ""Gameplay is much better then DLS 19.Now it's not so easy to get really good squad,I can't buy top player if I have poor team rating,I like this approach.And now about bad: why I can't sell players?And what about their skills?I would like to improve player's rating just like in DLS19.I need a lot of diamonds to unlock all formations. Injuries and red cards are common now. Foul after sliding tackle=injury.8/10 fouls are punished with red card. This things were better in DLS 19."", ""Great game I love this game but the thing is that why do you need WiFi to play? Before, you only needed WiFi for online (which didn't work) and please can you add a different level because it is too easy and I usually win against a person in my league 2-7 nil or 1. Please do that. Overall though, it is an amazing game so I give it 5 stars *****."", ""Used to be most preferred football game. A big fan and addicted of playing DLS but not after this new DLS 2020 version out. Very disappointed with the new unnecessary features implementated in the game -limiter transfer choices, can't buy good players as long your rating of team poor, hard to collect gems and etc. Rather replaying/restart DLS 2019 instead which the best of all versions. Used to recommend my friends playing DLS but not this new one."", ""The DLS 2020 is an absolute downgrade from what they've been building over the years. The graphics is now terrible. Money is hard to come by. Then, why will you add gems to a football game? It's unneccessary. Introduction of agents and scouts have made good players to be scarce. You'll have to pay so much coins for random players you don't even want. I'm sticking to DLS 2019.""]"

Two thumbs up👍🏽👍🏽', ""I love this game! It's the only fishing game like I used to play on PS2. The 3D graphics are outstanding. You feel like you're actually out there on the lake with beautiful weather. Then sometimes it's drizzling and that's neat, too. And the way the camera follows the lure after you cast it is so awesome you actually feel it a little in the pit of your stomach, like you're really flying through the air behind it. I think that may be may favorite part. lol. Keep up the good work!"", ""Not bad. NEVER any forced ads. Simple game play. Progression is a bit of a grind, but ithe intrigue is there if you give it a chance. It's no scenic safari adventure. More like a trip to the local perk-pond with the kiddos.

It's gets worse every season."", ""Do not spend a cent on this game. By all means download it but do not spend a cent.

Since I got a new phone, the app will only open immediately after I've restarted the phone. I contacted customer support, and in 6 days of troubleshooting their only answer was that the latest version isn't compatible with my phone and that I should keep playing on my previous device. Furthermore, since I've contacted Glu, when the app does work, it tells me that login is not available, though it was before. Poor service."", ""This is the best sports game I have played on a mobile. the most entertaining baseball game I have played, period. Even compared to platform MLB. The team building is highly detailed, the climb to the top ranks is pretty of fun. The Club system does a beautiful job of keeping it competitive. And best of all, you can generate a near legendary team over a month or so without spending constant money. (they do deserve a purchase now and then) Best costumer service I've ever seen on an app, by far!"", ""The game is unplayable since the newest update. In the time that it now takes to autoplay one inning, you used to be able to go through nost of a game. They took the fun out of some of the best events, and have completely ignored others. The game has gone from pay to win, to teetering on pay to play. There's no way to truly enjoy the game without spending money every day"", ""I would really love to give this app 5* because it has 5* potential but compared to previous versions this has been the most money grab season of them all and I've played them all 17 and 18 being the best. Difficulty vs skill in some events like walk off hero which in the past was the communities favorite event is non existent, it's all based on luck with the pitches, if you get them you win if you don't lose. Lag is still an issue random crashing is also. Hopefully 20 is more like 18 and not 19"", ""I still can't receive video achievements, as the videos freeze up and don't play and then I have to force close the game. That alone takes away from gifts and upgrade potential. I spend so much gold to get trash. You guys have to do better with odds and the players involved in the boxes, to limit the likelihood of wasting so much gold to win terrible players back. It sucks. Hoping things continue to improve, because still overall this is my favorite MLB sponsored game."", 'The pitcher hesitates for a split second before he throws the ball. Got a new phone so its not that..did it on my old phone also. This has cost me base hits,several strike outs and who knows how many runs. Ive had this game for a few yrs and its just not worth the frustration. Otherwise a pretty cool game. Fix if ya can', ""After last update , cannot manually set batting order, option stuck in standard mode. Also, once you see if you're facing a right or left handed pitcher before the start of a game, the lineup & batting order is locked. 2018 version you could view matchup, exit out and set your best lineup and batting order depending on who was pitching and whether they were a lefty or righty and it would change accordingly. Update: Manual batting order good now after November 26th update, thank you."", ""The lagging on this app is ridiculous. Pitcher freezes up a split second before the ball comes out and he's already throwing 104. The worst part is i have literally seen the ball get hit in play, but because it lags i get called for a swinging strikeout and i saw the ball and the shadow of the ball go in play. Fix this!!"", ""The absolute worst customer service. Besides undermining the game by disabling vital buttons after you've put in 2 to 3 hours playing a progressive event, they ignore your every single complaint with a dumb form letter blaming 3rd party advertisers. Meanwhile, the ads work fine, sometimes, in other areas of the game. This company should be investigated for fraud. I am sure they are tampering with paying customers' time, emotion and wallets. Beware."", ""Constantly introducing new players each week and expecting people to compete with them whilst upgrading your existing players at the same time is ridiculous. That process only makes playing bonus games and/or season mode even harder. Walk off hero is also frustrating and dont get me started on the amount of money you would need to spend to make your team legitimately great. I've had enough. Hopefully Glu improves upon these things in the future."", ""Used to be a good game but over time you will find out you need a lot of money to have fun in this game it's terrible for people who just want a free game plus the gifts they give you aren't good this is a money making game only for glu.. mlb 9 inning is my go to until this game is a little more generous"", ""I have a screen shot of getting Voctor Reyes and he wasn't in my list of players. That was the 3rd time in this happened this weekend alone. 2 were from fmgidt boxes and 1 was from being the mvp in club vs club. The support center said there is no proof that I opened up the players but I literally have the screen shot of getting Reyes. All 3 were bonus players this weekend and really costed me and my club points towards the ranking. The support center is not helpful at all"", ""simply unplayable right now. glitches in play means you can not hit a pitch. all things promised to reregister were not received as of now. Maybe they will be delivered in the future. everything is very slow. I will allow time for improvement but only for a limited amount of time. I hope they fix these because I love and played 2018 a lot. right now I recommend you stick with that one at least for now. once again can't get on the app. horrible"", ""If you like baseball and games that progressively build, this is it for you. Between the thrill of leveling up players and all the different game modes, I'm addicted. The ads can be a bit annoying at first so better just spend a couple bucks right off the bat so they go away."", ""Game is decent and thats the only reason I'm giving 2 stars. Customer service sucks, advertisers suck and it's so rigged on some stages that make it near impossible to compete. They're also very greedy, so if you don't have the extra money to spend....don't waste the time"", ""always like tap sports just wish we could have kept more than 3 players. *Update* dropped to 2 stars, this game has become a money grab joke. Recycling the same garbage players over and over. Lags like hell and keeps crashing now. I hope '20 is more like '18"", ""For some unkown reason every so often when I try to open the app. it keeps on saying loading failed and app. Won't open, I'd have to uninstall it and reinstall it. And I know for sure that my network connection and signal is excellent and connected. That happened to me 2 or 3 times so far and I would have start all over and I ended up losing all my great player I've worked so hard to get"", ""Same lineup issue for two weeks ... Response? We r aware of the issue and 'working on it' 🙄. Update: had to wait a month but the rollout of the new update is 🔥! Faster/better response times than ever and lineup issue is fixed!!!"", ""Update: I am amending my review from 2 stars to 1 star. This game is a total money grab. Just to give you an idea, I have spend over 500 in this game and yet it is not enough to be competitive because the best modes in the game (WoH) have been designed to milk you out of you gold and money. When I have the best players in the game fully capped in level and skills almost capped (17/20) I shouldn't be given unhittable pitches called for strike every damn time. This game is not worth the investment"", ""The game graphics, stuff like that are good, but the problems I have are 1 - u don't play defense, but that could just be because I'm not playing season yet... 2 - & this is probably not everyone's, but for some reason, I'm wanting to play & be the Seattle Mariners, & I was when I 1st started, but somehow, now my Seattle Mariners don't have their original club - They have the players from either the Pit Pirates or the L.A. Angels,- but their in Sea Marininers uniforms Out/options HELP PLEASE!!!"", ""This Game used to be good until the latest update. From the moment I installed and began to emerse my self. This Game is a lot of fun. I like the fact that you can.control all aspect of you players. It took me months however I slowly attained over 100%. This took time and countless plays and I found out today that the Game has changed my category that which now I had to either play more or spend more money to get back at being 100%. Its a Sham. Vert disappointed. Today I'm changing my rating."", ""Fun game, but this most recent update has made it incredibly laggy, to the point where it's almost too frustrating to wait on. Don't update unless you have to or wait until an update after 10/14 is released and reviewed. *edit* updates have since been made that make it as snappy as it used to be, re-rated to five stars"", 'The baseball game itself is not bad but it has options for the user to watch videos to get free gold or in some cases to watch videos when purchasing a player to roll again for a chance for a better player. The thing is when the user selects to watch the video the game begins to flash back and forth between the game and the video and the whole thing just locks up and you have to restart your system to get back to the game. It only causes FRUSTRATING! FIX IT PLEASE!!! OR REMOVE IT FROM THE GAME!!', 'Hope you like making it to a base on 1 in every 10 at bats and God help you if you actually try to make a home run the only players that seem to be able to do it are ""premium"" players and you have to pay to use them for every game like a subscription service its stupid', ""cool the best the best the best I never seen a game like it when you get all combos you can hit balls that's all you can do literally baseball is the awesome but that game it's like you're in the field for real life like if you like real baseball you going to love this game you can hit the ball you can and then it's super awesomeI hate all games so I know this game is pretty good not all Subway surfers pretty good too but we not talking about Subway surfer this game is off the chart come on coo"", ""not to far along so will update rating..but addictive. always trying to upgrade players.

But, the loading time issues are frustrating, and the trouble claiming rewards for watching videos is infuriating.', ""It started off as a fun game, then one problem at a time, each update added more bugs and problems and didn't fix the problems.

Thanks for playing!","['Cool game... It seems to have glitches... several times, I have been kicked out by the server and when I log back in, i was told that I had forfeited the game I was playing. It does get pretty annoying especially since it affects my stats and my play credits. Controls are ok. Several times the AI took control of my running back and went a different route than I was going. When passing the ball to a receiver, my selection is not always chosen and is thrown to someone else.', ""Game is another money grab from EA. $30 to play event seasons and thats each. So you can't get a good team by working hard. This should seriously be illegal. Graphics are bad and controls are bad. They basically put their worst team on the game development and expect people to spend 4× the cost of the console version just to play different modes. Criminal organization. Hopefully you asshats go bankrupt."", ""So far so good, I have been playing since Madden 18. This game has always been one of my favorites. I started playing Madden 20 in September and it has been a good Madden mobile game. But if you don't have a good signal, it is very annoying. You start playing then it logs you out if you have low or no signal. Overall this game is very great and very well-made. I would recommend this game to anybody who is intrigued in the NFL. P.S. EA if your listening please make a new Rob Gronkowski card soon."", 'Love the game. Buying and selling players, upgrading them, and building a stunning roster. I wish the season mode games were a little harder. It would also be kind of cool if you could make direct player or item trades with league team mates. And lastly, it seems impossible to get Madden cash without paying real money for it. Otherwise great game. Recommend to all.', 'This game is very fun if you like football and know some of the players. The special events they have in madden are fun to work at. The rewards are usually pretty good. The seasons mode is a lot better than last year with the addition of trades. Sometimes they make it too hard to get a player, but overall a great game', 'at the moment I give this game is 2 star. Startibg very first about tthe overalls, I have a 84 overall in DEF and its terrible. Most of my players are ""trained"" highly but when I vs an 73 overall DEF there intercepting my balls left and right? And my players are mostly open but the 73 DEF does a ""boost"" and ints? Trust me it\'s not my OFF either, I have a 85 overall in OFF. Madden used to be a banger back in 2017, but now it\'s once again ..a 2 star :///', ""Decent game. Need a filter for minimum power you would for players. Sometimes an 85 overall player has 10 power I have to look 5 minutes to get the same 85 overall player with 50 power (sometimes he'llbe cheaper to. Power makes a biggggg difference in this game. FIX YOUR DAMN GLITCH!!!! THE DE IS BEATING MY 97 OVERALL OT ON EVERY DAMN PLAY..... 97 OVERALL NOT 80..... I FLIP THE PLAY AND THE SAME THING HAPPENS. FIX IT"", ""Honestly I love this game. It's the best game I ever played. But the only reason I am only giving 4 stars is because the game keeps a black screen every time I open it. I have tolerated this behavior many times, but I ignored it just because the game is so good. But if madden reads my review, I hope that they will fix this problem soon. No pressure Madden, but if you fix this, madden will be the best game ever."", ""Sets dissapear without warning. Just upgraded ultimate legends tier and today there is no way to play for items despite 27weeks showing left on timer. This game rips rug out from under you just as you're making progress and gives a whole new set to work for. Deep pockets blowing mad cash is about the only way. Don't bother unless just really bored."", ""I really love the game, but it's become boring because the Career Tributes on madden today make the game the most fun, now that's the only reason I play. Please put more career tributes. Also, you should give rewards for everyday that you log on. Finally, you should make it easier to upgrade your team as you get better, because without madden can, it's almost impossible to get better. And you should make madden cash buyable with gems, or a lot of coins."", 'Really good addicting game but you need to fix those trash controls. Nevermind, how can a hard team in seasons make a 17-0 comeback in 3rd quarter when I have playmaker and full legend and elite squad. The reality of this game is outrageously unbelievable. How can a 83 ovr. catch the ball over TWO, no, THREE 90 ovr. players!', 'Awesome game but a little hard to understand instructions could be a lot better! 8 think I understand most of the game now starting to get some big high number players now just in time for 2021 to come out just to lose all my hard work and hours of work they should let you take your 2020 players to 2021 that would be cool at least like 10 players or something like that!', ""Can be a fun game easy to level up your team. But just like on the consoles the multiplayer you have to do to level up your couch and league play is horrible. Soon as you snap the ball you get sacked or the QBs throw the ball away. The one that happens all the time is the corners will hold the receivers on the line for the most of the play. Or your receiver's get caught on them when running down the field. Then you play an 80 over team and they act like their a 100 overall and ur team bad"", ""Everything keeps freezing at 99%. I've uninstalled and reinstalled. Cleared history and cookies. When it freezes on league play and overdrive matches it automatically forfeits me every time and in season mode the computer just takes over games when you're playing on defense. No matter what you do they are going to score. Super unrealistic."", ""Where to begin. Teams significantly worse than mine (75OVR vs 91OVR) somehoe have the ability to make interceptions on plays which are inhuman. Hail Mary events in overdrive are impossible. Every second League vs League event I am unable to take part in. My phone locks itself every 2 minutes when playing the game, making online impossible. But the most annoying thing is that the help email doesn't work and I know this has and will fall on deaf ears"", ""Was a fun game, but as soon as I started getting somewhere in the game, it crashed every single time I tried to play anything. I have uninstalled, completely wiped the data from my phone and it doesn't matter. They obviously don't care about the players and it's never worth it to install games like this. Would be a 3 star game if I could, you know, actually play it."", ""I've been playing madden since I was younger and when I saw it in my play store I had to get it . 4 years of playing Madden with my cellphone and this game never let's you down , the mobile version gets better and better every year. Thank you so much for the hard work it definitely pays off."", 'I just got the game a couple of weeks ago and i got to play one season.. I changed the team and then i started a season and whenever the loading percentage went to 100% the app would close... I cancelled the season and tried over and over again.. It also did this with any challenge i tried to do.. I uninstalled and reinstalled many times.. I changed the team back to what i previously had and tried it and it still didnt work... Reeeeee', 'Everytime I play the arena mode, the app shuts itself down and when I reopen the app, it says I forfeited the game. Every. Single. Time!! Then with the h2h mode, I won 23-15 and it also said that i forfeited the game. I played for a week to see if it would get better and aame results. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS GAME', 'In game buys way too expensive. You can spend $75 to $100 just to buy 1 player to upgrade your team. Bad thing is most of these buys can loose value as they release higher ovr players during the season. So you can see you can easily have spend hundreds even thousands of dollars trying to keep your team competitive. Cheaper to buy the newest playstation and a dozen games at $40 to $60 a pop. EA needs to lower their prices to level the playing field. Not everyone has that kind of cash to waist.', 'DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS GAME. It is pay to play....every new promo they bring out a new player they nerf the old ""best player""...You also play A LOT of bots....they also nerf your team so lower rated teams can win. Game play is horrendous as well...many many complaints about controls not working. Just check Twitter for validity of this review.', ""Overdrive players are cheating. Tolerated it long enough until i was ahead by 500pts plus. Then at 0:01 left, the score goes from 798 (me) 276 (them) to 798 (me) and 904 (them). Until you fix your hacker issue (some plays, i am tackled right at the snap. Thus proving that they can see what i am picking. That software does exist btw), I'm done."", ""This game use to be great like two months ago,now it's just bad. Not only going against a team in the arena that has 1,300 team power and you having 850,But when you tap the button to throw the ball it won't even throw at times. And for Overdrive they sometimes give the opponent's extra points for no reason or work that they didnt even do at times! Fix this game please!"", ""Really fun but there are a couple issues. 1) While playing in seasons, after a while the arms will glitch all over the place and it messed up my QB's throws and i lost that game. 2) When playing seasons there should be a difficulty in-between medium and hard because in medium i won every game but in hard i lost every game. Other than this its a fun game and cant wait to keep playing Thanks!"", ""It's a lil slow but I love football so much it doesn't matter. It's a great game for football fans although every game can't be perfect. Especially when they have a console version that brings in real money you can't expect them to update or fix this as much"", 'Fun time killer, but dont take it serious. You can build an ultimate team and see 98 ovr players fumble and drop open passes in overdrive events. Stick with madden today events, and season mode and you will be ok. Dont waste money on this game because your team will look like a pro bowl team one game and a division 3 high school team the next.', 'I cant even play the game because it keeps shutting me out. I try to play an event and then the app stops and goes to my home screen. This used to be a great game, there werent any problems before. I would give it 5 starts if it was the way it was before', ""this game has connection timeouts every 2 minutes I've played this game for like year's and this is the worst year outta all if them im uninstalling and when i play competitive i am winning by lots of points it crashes and i login and it automatically forfeits and it makes m3 lose PS, The game has got alot better since, i took a 4 months break then started playing again."", ""It's a fun game. I always loved madden mobile, but this one I had a difficult time to play. You have little stamina, and the players you play against are sometimes 4-15 overall above you!!! Sometimes when you press on a player, the QB throws it to someone else! Also, the game disconnects frequently even when I'm sitting next to the wifi router."", ""The game was fun at first but once you get further in it gets awful. You can have running backs with 90+ speed and get chased down by lineman. Players can tackle you from 15 yards away. Not to mention the customer service is horrendous. Had a couple problems and both times I emailed them they did absolutely nothing. Didn't get rewards from an event and after asking me the same questions 5 times they basically told me too bad. I guess that's what you get when you outsource your customer service."", 'This app usually works extremely smoothly. However recently I am not receiving rewards for completing Diamond Blitz events. Spending 80 stamina, not receiving a reward, and the attempt still registering, its causing stamina waste. Will definitely increase my rating after this issue is addressed.', 'A great game, but since EA Help stopped email support in favor of phone support I am unable to get help because each time I initiate a case, EA Help sends me an email with two links to initiate a phone support call and both links lead to a blank case information page. Until this very frustrating issue is fixed my rating will stay low. I hope EA Help will reinitiate email help ASAP because I am angry at spending real money and in-game currency on content I then do not receive (aka rip-off).', ""Yay I lost my league I was in hall of fame and it kicked me out of the game so I lost it's so annoying this game sucks. And I hate how you don't get to keep your jerseys after every big update and that's another reason why I hate this game. And EA needs to lower the prices down not a lot of people have spare cash like that"", ""Anybody who gave this game a good rating is either RICH or have played the game only a few times. I have played this game for 4 years in a row. Very dedicated 3 of 4 years. It's a HUGE cash grab now. Even more than before. Go figure it's EA. You have to pay for everything, EVERYTHING! Building your team up does nothing I promise. That 92 overall that costs $100, yes $100 for a fake mobile game card, does absolutely nothing to the performance of your team. FU EA. Scum."", ""Great gameplay and fun game modes but lacks a exhibition mode so after a while the ultimate team gets boring and the stamina gets low to quickly. Also the season mode is fun but I wish I could perpose trades. This still feels like a mut mobile, they are getting closer to a real Madden mobile with season mode but aren't there yet this game gets boring and when microtransactions are required for special seasons or special events there is something wrong - Madden NFL Mobile 20"", ""I play this game and really enjoy playing it. But the new update is what I'm assuming is the problem seeing as how the game played fine before the update but after when I go to play it doesn't load the players. Everything else is fine. I can snap the ball throw the ball run the ball what jat ever i want. But I CAN'T SEE ANY PLAYERS !!!! PLEASE FIX THIS BUG!!!......... I am pleased to say that the bugs have been fixed and the game is awesome. The only problem is the fact of so many new updates."", ""Overall solid play. Only thing I don't like is in head 2 head it'll forfeit without you doing it. Also, it take to long to get the top notch players without spending money. Just the same players over and over in the packs. What's up with these updates every other week? Geesh. Why can't I update this game. Everytime it's time for an update, I always gotta do it over 10 times. What's up with all these updates?"", 'I would say 3.5 stars. Compared with prior seasons, it\'s much less likely that items being auctioned sell. Even items placed well under ""market value"" come back unsold at varying tiers of cards. The result is a giant stockpile of cards as you improve that should be helpful but essentially have very little value. On the positive side, there are so many different ways to play for hours on end that are all pretty interesting.', 'The game is fun, but it needs a little more work to be most popular again. Like adding a practice mode so the player can understand all the moves by learning himself/herself. Controller support needs to be fixed a bit. I sully understand that it was rushed and there is still some updates to it, but the slit delay in movement needs to be fixed if you want to have further more knowledge on what to fix for controller support. Please accept this as a few requests to help the game progress further.', ""My experience madden is really fun now that i'm getting the hang of things and I must say that the designers did a great job with this one because im beginning to like this alot... There is some small things but im sure its because of the phone im using,.. Play style mechanics is overall beautifull for me allmost like im really there.. Uhm.. The graphics mechanics is also superb for an android game... Yes the controls could use a little twitching i think thats all... Well overall your awesome!!""]"

Ditch those because It\'s entirely not worth putting $30 in the game to pay for 1 card that only gave me a 71 overall player. That\'s ridiculous. I would much rather pay for the game from the start and have more like a trading system to acquire players. Microtransactions and the way you\'ve built your game have been engineered to ""pay to win"" and to stunt the growth of the franchise within the game. It\'s not sexy, its greedy.', 'Love the game but theres a glitch when a infielder scoops up the ball, instead of throwing the ball to home plate to get the runner out going home, it throws it to 1st base. There are no dropped balls in the outfield when fly balls come down. The game is so close to being realistic but the few glitches need addressed.', ""It's definitely an amazing game, but for me on my iPhone it will quit right in middle of me playing.. It doesn't matter what mode it happens all the time. Also I feel like they make it extremely hard to get diamond level players and still have yet to tell me how to go from a gold player to a diamond player. For the other levels you're able to upgrade player.. For instance you can upgrade from bronze to silver and from silver to gold but not from gold to diamond... Why is that??"", 'I loved this game and originally gave it a 5 star but the more i played i realized that i will never get any good cards. I have yet to ever sign a free agent spending countless stars to try to get one. Not to mention i spent at least $100 on the game and i never get anything good in my packs. How people have a whole team of diamond prime players and i cant even get one even after spending a nice amount of money. Im to the point of deleting it and finding a new baseball game.', ""I've had to reinstall this game numerous times because of malfunctions, just last week I had to reinstall the game when my swing button stopped working for 2 days, & I had to start my League Mode 2030 162 Game season over, after I was already past the All Star Break, before having to reinstall the app again to correct it. Still lots of Bugs in this Game. I answered this weeks Trivia Questions correct, i answered St. Louis Cardinals, & I was told i was wrong, even though i was 100% correct!!!"", ""Could have been a much better game than it is, unfortunately it's one of those games where you have to deal with something like contracts, condition of player or injury. Once one of your players is in bad condition and you fix it, they just get in bad condition after the next game. Even if they dont even play in it. So after every game it's something you have to do."", ""The swing button is still very problematic. I've complained about this several times, but nothing has been done about it. It always seem to target certain batters, especially on an 0 and 2 count. It will not allow my hitters to swing at the crucial pitch, and they strike out. I will not play the clutch hits mode because of this. Will you please fix this? My hitters would be doing much better if they swung when I push the button, instead of late or not at all."", ""Game is a lot better. Gets better every year.

Sometimes my players hit nothing but homeruns and sometimes nothing but ground balls, right to an infielder. Doesn't matter how I swing at it, seems like pure chance. I would love to know what actually determines the outcome of pitches and swings. I'll throw a ball outside as far as possible and the opposing player will still hit a homerun.

I will no longer spend 300 stars on an attempt that apparently is malfunctioning. Previous message in 1on 1 did not resolve my issue.', ""Since update it doesn't play as smoothly as before update.

Now my lineup for the dh lineup won't register and each game I play, I can't use my dh lineup it goes to my basic player's lineup don't understand y can u look into it thanks"", 'It is a good game for baseball fans, but it is quite expensive if you want to grow your team, also I had a glitch when I purchased a package and I sent a message 3 times with no reply or refund as long as you just play the normal season it does not cost only when you play other players.', 'Love this game I had to delete one time cause it quit working and I was in the middle of a season. I got it back a couple months later and works awesome. I love how you can choose 162 games I am good at the game but it gives me a change to get even better. The inning are realistic and are like the real thing. If I could change one thing it would be to have the innings on the big screen have the points be on that screen per inning.

EVERYTHING is way too expensive or like for me if you dont pay anything it will take forever to rank anything up because of the prices.', 'This game is ok, but be careful the more you play the more the game is stacked against you like computer ai pitcher diamond has all skill levels at 6 so makes it not so much fun to play, and you struggle to increase your players to these skill levels.

Other than this, and the lack of feminine hair styles, the game is a great game and would be 5 stars from me.', ""The game itself is fun. Lots of features, and I like how it's not fully pay to play or fully pay to win. The problem is the loading screen is horrendously slow and doesn't work half of the time. Also, the game has some performance issues on a OnePlus 6 at times (mainly a few minutes after the phone boots and during calls), which is also a bummer."", 'My experience on this game is really good because I have learnt new tactics which will allow me to use in a real match at school. My brother and I loves this because he only like doing the dunks and the crazy hoops.

As soon as you build up enough money and have a game on the career mode the servers can't seem to handle it and the lag makes it impossible to play well.

Disappointing as this issue stops any real progression in the game. One on one games - when taking a shot, the ball is well past the opponent, and all of a sudden it is a blocked shot. Another issue is when playing a Shooting Race my timer will run out, whilst the opponent will be able to take their shot. Frustrating as there is potential for this to be a superb game. One star.', ""Good Game . Really enjoyable. The only thing with this Game is just about money. U don't really need to know how to play or be at a higher level to be a winner, as soon as you buy skills the game won't allow you to win .

This game turns semi pros mad. MY balls were all upgraded to slide in or bang but there is no way of penetrating the pot when you face 3x more experienced scorers. The server is slow and the app drains the battery far too quickly due to number of adds. Stay away to keep your sanity. I would have scored way better using my own balls.', 'The game is fun but it sometimes seems rigged. First when I go to shoot the ball it will be right at the basket but then it will somehow go back to when I shoot it and say it was blocked. Second the shooting rave seems to stop whenever it wants (mostly in favor of others) and also in the shooting games my opponent gets the extra point ball more than I do. PLEASE FIX.', 'Not Fair! How come my opponents score points even when they miss the basket (they hit the back board for the bonus...the ball doesn\'t go in the basket but they get the points anyway - FIX)...it happens all the time...i don\'t get the points like that - so why should my opponents.

Not only did it crash but recorded all 3 times as a loss and that's not fair and completely ruined it for me. Even worse, I spent money buying gold for more clothing bags . Customer service never responds and for this I will tell everyone about my experience which has also happened to several customers with no care for the customer. Bad business"", ""Game is really fun but it sux not being able to earn very much gold and you can't play the shooting mini game very often unless u pay real money. Other than that.

But whether I'm on wifi or my cell data, my ping always sucks. Greatly disadvantages me, when I play against anyone my shot goes into the net and the graphics disturbingly sets me back to my opponent blocking me. Great source of discouragement. Great game but lacks averaging of ping"", ""Get rid of the damn backboard bonus... It's unfair and requires no skill to make tons of points... You can lose games to bad players because of this and it makes it highly annoying. Other than that add a reason to actually have money because it serves no purpose."", ""I like the game alot but I dont think on the Attack-Deffender they should make you go against people that has a higher rank than you and One the Shooting Race I think the same and I also think they should not let you or the other opponent go against someone with a lower rank I think that's not fair ovisaly the person with the higher rank is gonna win and I think they should have a tutorial to show you all the tricks. Because ovisaly the one that knows the tricks is gonna win."", 'I think there are some cheating going on in this game. In a shooting race, I observed that my opponents can miss the basket, but still managed to get a rebound bonus. It skews the game and diminishes the fun element for those who play the game without modifications. Can the developers investigate this please?', 'Update: 3 star review...great game guys!! But if you TRULY want to compete in this game you have to pay theres no doubt about it...a few things to address now...this game can get extremely laggy at times during matches..also theres a HUGE disconnection issue going on as well...if you guys can fix those 2 problems then ill rate this game a 5...PLEASE ADD AN ""ADD FRIEND"" AT THE END OF MATCHES..like COD Mobile has🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥hope you guys look at my review thanks for a great game!!!', 'Game KILLERS?!

It neither gives you opposition from your division, nor does it consider deflected goals.

I know you wanna make money but now it's too obvious just to get money."", 'After recent update, gameplay is worsened. I was playing World tour match, and the cursor shifts from one player to other in that very last moment which makes game difficult.

Hope this review was useful.', ""The problem in fifa 20 in its divisonal rivalry is it's not about how u play the game if ur opponent rivals point is greater than yours u chances of winning becomes very less. U can't dribble the defenders, nor u wins headers and after very random tackle ball goes to ur opponent team. Disgusting. After fifa 14 fifa has lost its credibility."", 'Decent game.

When passing the ball to a receiver, my selection is not always chosen and is thrown to someone else.', ""Game is another money grab from EA. $30 to play event seasons and thats each. So you can't get a good team by working hard. This should seriously be illegal. Graphics are bad and controls are bad.

It's the best game I ever played. But the only reason I am only giving 4 stars is because the game keeps a black screen every time I open it.

No pressure Madden, but if you fix this, madden will be the best game ever."", ""Sets dissapear without warning.

But just like on the consoles the multiplayer you have to do to level up your couch and league play is horrible. Soon as you snap the ball you get sacked or the QBs throw the ball away.

DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS GAME', 'In game buys way too expensive. You can spend $75 to $100 just to buy 1 player to upgrade your team. Bad thing is most of these buys can loose value as they release higher ovr players during the season. So you can see you can easily have spend hundreds even thousands of dollars trying to keep your team competitive. Cheaper to buy the newest playstation and a dozen games at $40 to $60 a pop. EA needs to lower their prices to level the playing field. Not everyone has that kind of cash to waist.', 'DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS GAME. It is pay to play....every new promo they bring out a new player they nerf the old ""best player""...You also play A LOT of bots....they also nerf your team so lower rated teams can win.

Also, the game disconnects frequently even when I'm sitting next to the wifi router."", ""The game was fun at first but once you get further in it gets awful. You can have running backs with 90+ speed and get chased down by lineman. Players can tackle you from 15 yards away. Not to mention the customer service is horrendous. Had a couple problems and both times I emailed them they did absolutely nothing. Didn't get rewards from an event and after asking me the same questions 5 times they basically told me too bad. I guess that's what you get when you outsource your customer service."", 'This app usually works extremely smoothly. However recently I am not receiving rewards for completing Diamond Blitz events. Spending 80 stamina, not receiving a reward, and the attempt still registering, its causing stamina waste. Will definitely increase my rating after this issue is addressed.', 'A great game, but since EA Help stopped email support in favor of phone support I am unable to get help because each time I initiate a case, EA Help sends me an email with two links to initiate a phone support call and both links lead to a blank case information page. Until this very frustrating issue is fixed my rating will stay low. I hope EA Help will reinitiate email help ASAP because I am angry at spending real money and in-game currency on content I then do not receive (aka rip-off).', ""Yay I lost my league I was in hall of fame and it kicked me out of the game so I lost it's so annoying this game sucks. And I hate how you don't get to keep your jerseys after every big update and that's another reason why I hate this game. And EA needs to lower the prices down not a lot of people have spare cash like that"", ""Anybody who gave this game a good rating is either RICH or have played the game only a few times. I have played this game for 4 years in a row. Very dedicated 3 of 4 years. It's a HUGE cash grab now. Even more than before. Go figure it's EA. You have to pay for everything, EVERYTHING! Building your team up does nothing I promise. That 92 overall that costs $100, yes $100 for a fake mobile game card, does absolutely nothing to the performance of your team. FU EA. Scum."", ""Great gameplay and fun game modes but lacks a exhibition mode so after a while the ultimate team gets boring and the stamina gets low to quickly. Also the season mode is fun but I wish I could perpose trades. This still feels like a mut mobile, they are getting closer to a real Madden mobile with season mode but aren't there yet this game gets boring and when microtransactions are required for special seasons or special events there is something wrong - Madden NFL Mobile 20"", ""I play this game and really enjoy playing it. But the new update is what I'm assuming is the problem seeing as how the game played fine before the update but after when I go to play it doesn't load the players. Everything else is fine. I can snap the ball throw the ball run the ball what jat ever i want. But I CAN'T SEE ANY PLAYERS !!!! PLEASE FIX THIS BUG!!!......... I am pleased to say that the bugs have been fixed and the game is awesome. The only problem is the fact of so many new updates."", ""Overall solid play. Only thing I don't like is in head 2 head it'll forfeit without you doing it. Also, it take to long to get the top notch players without spending money. Just the same players over and over in the packs. What's up with these updates every other week? Geesh. Why can't I update this game. Everytime it's time for an update, I always gotta do it over 10 times. What's up with all these updates?"", 'I would say 3.5 stars. Compared with prior seasons, it\'s much less likely that items being auctioned sell. Even items placed well under ""market value"" come back unsold at varying tiers of cards. The result is a giant stockpile of cards as you improve that should be helpful but essentially have very little value. On the positive side, there are so many different ways to play for hours on end that are all pretty interesting.', 'The game is fun, but it needs a little more work to be most popular again. Like adding a practice mode so the player can understand all the moves by learning himself/herself. Controller support needs to be fixed a bit. I sully understand that it was rushed and there is still some updates to it, but the slit delay in movement needs to be fixed if you want to have further more knowledge on what to fix for controller support. Please accept this as a few requests to help the game progress further.', ""My experience madden is really fun now that i'm getting the hang of things and I must say that the designers did a great job with this one because im beginning to like this alot... There is some small things but im sure its because of the phone im using,.. Play style mechanics is overall beautifull for me allmost like im really there.. Uhm.. The graphics mechanics is also superb for an android game... Yes the controls could use a little twitching i think thats all... Well overall your awesome!!""]"

As you play you will get chests that include improved clubs, and balls that provide power, wind resistance etc. As you win matches you get these chests. You ONLY have 4 slots. It takes time to unlock these chests. When you run out of slots, they force you to use gold. Well...the only way to get gold, is to buy it. Bottom line, if you want to improve, you need to pay.', ""I agree with all the negative reviews. I am 81years of age and have been playing this game for a long time and did a lot of winning. Recently, I can't win except every now and then. And never win a high stake game. I have bought coins a several times, but I will not waste any more money just to have my coins taken away. I only play for fun, not in groups and leagues and I don't think it's right to be taken by experts or cheaters, and the owners of MGK are cheaters. I'm finished!!!!!!!!!!"", ""Love the game but having issues, I don't think it's fair to bounce off the side of a sand pit when the ball clearly supposed to go in, I've been cheated by other players over and over again because of it. Every time I have a bad connection it takes me out of the game and takes my coins without returning them, but I have had them returned once before. Buy the way how are you supposed to take place in Kings land if everyone has better equipment, is there a way we can up grade equipment faster plz"", 'Waste of TIME. I downloaded a few games for the Free gold and Free coins and got denied my rewards!! I put my time, energy and money into these games to complete the offer! I think these offers are a Joke and so is this game!!! I have several glitches, my opponents shot freezes every time, my opponents name will say ""Brandi"" and have a pic of a girl but when its opponents turn its a pic of a ""cat"" so the pictures dont match with my player. I am most definately dissatisfied with this game! 4 YRS!', ""So I'm really glad you have an abundant amount of annoyingly placed water on your maps. This game was so fun up until the point that I started being punished with a course reset and automatic loss every time I hit a water spot. Why don't u leave all that lame to actual golf and let Mini golf be the simple and fun version it's supposed to be? There is a reason people like mini golf and not real golf. Remove the punishing element of water from this game entirely. It doesn't need it."", ""The game has taking on a real bad twist. The ball will not stay in the hole. Matchups are totally unfair. When you have to go second. There are no coins left to gather. So losing continually because the way they have now set it up. The owner's have became very greedy. I had 1.7 million coins a week ago. Now I have 3000. Useto compete on stage 5-7 very well. Since last update can't win a game. I refuse to use real money. All they do is take it back. Huge bummer an let down."", ""I was really enjoying this game UNTIL... so I needed more coins and I'm always an ad supporter when it comes to games like this. I downloaded coin master as part of getting over 96,000 points but I had to complete the 7th village. I not only met but exceeded the requirements.. I'm on my 15th village now.. Sent screen shots to the little support link and everything only to get an automated email stating I didn't complete the requirements...super sucks."", ""The option to watch videos for epic golf tee's is rigged. For a while I would choose the bottom left or right bubble to get tee's. I was always getting the same tee, wind or power, and a rare tee was always in the bubble I didn't pick. I decided to pick the same bubble so I could get a rare tee sometimes. But that isn't happening, I still only get the same tee every time. The chests take too long to open. When the slots are full there is no point in playing because you can't collect chests."", ""Good game in general and enjoyable messing with opponents. One genuinely confusing thing is why sometimes first player will get an eagle or birdie and finish the game before the second player can try even though the second player has more gems and points and deserves to get a shot. I don't think this happens in actual golf either?"", ""This game is awesome!!! However I gave it 4 stars because if you dont have or use a Facebook account to link, this game does not give you the option to put uour name or select a pic. Please try to update this. I do not use FB because i don't want anyone knowing my business lol. Any game should give you the option to pick a character and let you create a name. I am a female and my pic is a male with a number id. Please consider giving those without FB to select a character and name. Thank you"", ""Good game apart from its designed to use all your coins in game and trys forceing you to spend real money on the game also loaded with ads devs got greedy same road ea went down a now look at them! , shame as it could have been a good game but greedy game developer's after our money again, I would spent money to remove the ads but not now."", ""I really enjoy playing this game. It's def one if those addicting, only can put ur phone down cuz ur eyes and head r starting to hurt from staring at screen too long kinda games that's for sure. My only downside to game are the entry fees to play the different courses r very expensive and there's no way to just play it practice the courses by urself before spending almost all ur coins on a course ur unfamiliar with against a player who just as easily could b VERY FAMILIAR w/ that course."", ""This game is fun to play. I love it. I'm playing this game a lot often throughout the day. But lately, it's been putting me against players with better clubs and golf balls than me. For example, my opponent would have the soccer ball club and the swirl ball. Honestly once I got to stage 6 is when I started having these low chances of winning, not to mention even a fair chance of winning. Fix the matchmaking please."", ""Sorry I am busy - Sorry I am busy - Sorry I am busy So this game cheats you not just with incredibly lucky/unlucky bounces against you. If your internet connection goes bad or you can't pull the club back all the way, they only give you 10 seconds to fix it before your game times out. Very frustrating and lost thousands and thousands of coins this way, forcing me back to level 2 or 1 to try to earn enough to continue on. Emailed support for the occasional shoddy gameplay and experience."", ""It is so obvious that the game isn't won by ones skill it's about pay to play. Let the game be clean. Let people play as they would on a real golf course with their skill and strategy against opponents that are matched fairly. I hope that Mini Golf King will get rid of the rigged system and be a real golf course so players can win or lose on their own way they golf. I enjoy playing & it is the best golf game I've found."", ""I love this game!!! Thankyou to whom ever designed it and offers it.Its fun,and challenging.Great game!!!!!I'd guve it more stars than just 5.Still love this game.Except that at times when I do a 20,000 coin. challenge the game goes off line and I loose all my coins and after that I'm. it able to get back on anymore.I have to uninstall and reinstall I stall the game.Other than that problem I love this game I still love this game...my friend now plays and she loves it also.THANKYOU FOR CREATING!"", 'I had originally rated this a 4 as it is fun to play and doesn\'t require cash investment. However obtaining a club allowing the ball to ""fly"" is proving impossible and is reducing the fun factor. Also having the game cheat against me is no fun either. The wind will be 4 or 5 for me and then a 1 or 2 for my opponent and then back to 5 for me. I haven\'t deleted it yet but I\'m getting close.', ""It's alright up until you get to stage 8 up, then it becomes a pay 2 win for the players who can waste money on their addiction, if you don't have the money to purchase magnet Tees to beat the player that has just used one on you, then your just giving him your coins.. Not many courses on the stages the same ones over and over. The developer allows players to cheat as long as they've got the money to buy Gem Magnet Tees, this is what we call Pay 2 Win."", ""I have been playing for 6 months now I'm in a great team we have won our team challenge this game is very fun and easy game if you learn to bounce off surfaces and account for the wind and don't shoot too hard for the hole. This is one of the best free games on the market and if you are willing to play a lot you don't need to put in money just learn the course's amazing game"", ""There's nothing wrong with making golf a little more fun by adding gems and mystery boxes. Didn't know the game of golf was about gems and mystery boxes that help people cheat to win. What happened to respect for the game of golf? Other than that, it's a fun app that helps me get over boredom. Do people know how to win without taking shortcuts or using dirty tactics? What happened to golf games actually being competitive(games that last long)? I think equipment should be earned not purchased."", ""I had a 5 star rating all this game but I have noticed since playing the game a long time I think it's rigged I don't think that this game is playing at right there is times while a ball bounces out of the hole and I play all the same strategic things that I've always played and still losing can't get past 5 stage I am not the only one that has noticed this. Also notice that always put you with somebody with a higher level and has more equipment than you don't have"", ""The game was fun to start, but match making is absolutely horrible, it's not even fun to be matched with players that have equipment 4 stages above the one you have unlocked. Totally unfun and unfair. Even playing more, don't even waste your time with downloading this game, unless you want to be screwed by the complete bulllshit match making"", 'The game is a lot of fun but the matchmaking is terrible. When playing at higher levels being out ranked by someone who has almost zero environmental effects, no amount of skill can compete. Also, the environmental effects are really.inconsistent. One turn a 4mph wind barely moves your ball and the next turn a 1 mph wind moves your ball completely sideways. I love a good challenge but at least make it consistent.', ""Very confusing as to how to begin and continue playing. Maybe it's just me, but some of us need more tutorials and explanations. When a rare tip is given, it disappears before you can read it! Unless you are Tiger Woods, you might want to leave this one alone! Uninstalling."", ""WARNING: APP WILL OCCASIONALLY TAKE YOUR COINS TO ENTER A MATCH, BUT THEN TIME YOU OUT IN A MILLISECOND, THE ENTIRE GAME, NOT ALLOWING YOU TO PLAY IF THE INTERNET CONNECTION IS EVEN 1 BAR LOWER THAN FULL!!! DOES NOT HAPPEN WITH ANY OTHER APPS. The game is fun, but it takes forever to load. It also has some bugs, and the developers don't like to admit it much less reimburse you. Therefore, I still play, but refush to spend any cash."", 'It used to be much more fair but now only the elite who have good clubs and good balls and play on the top 10 boards can score enough to get on the leaderboard you used to be able to accumulate coins as you played and watch movies but now they only count the ones you win used to be much fairer.', 'Game is great with the exception of the possibility of advancing without spending large amounts of cash. Gave it a second go. Will now delete again and will not be going back. Great if you want to spend time on the same few beginner courses', 'I have downloaded this game 3 times just to watch how it is made...when your in high levels with high coins.the game will do what it can so you will lose.it wants you to spend money buy coins.it also matches u up against players with higher point.clubsect.just so u will lose also the wind will change for the better from them and not you .im trying 1 more time.it is made to try to get you to spend money.I WILL NEVER SPEND MONEY ON THIS GAME .I WOULD NOT GIVE IT 1 STAR.the game could be better', ""Stuck on a level/ no wins= Can't buy anything because you bought everything at your current level to the point u get the same stuff over again. No wins= u get kicked out of the groups or can't join. The tees are good for nothing don't waste ur money on them expect magnet & gem collectors. Ladies u very rarely beat a guy so don't have high expectations!"", 'Physics are good. The competative betting system is fun. Nice time user for the bus stop. Some items can be a bit costly and there are gaps in the levels of how many coins to bet. Easy to lose everything off of just a couple bad games. But fun overall.', ""I play this game all the time. It's great for children and adults. Sometimes very competitive. You can enjoy this game without ever having to pay any money . I am in a 1st class league and the more you play the better you get. Sometimes you are matched against other players that have more experience and vice versa. I think it depends on who is available at any given time. Sometimes I play well and sometimes I lose. Maybe you should download and see for yourself."", ""New updates have increased the time it takes to find a match, many times with bad connectivity issues. Bad redesign to entice paying cash for extras. Worst of all is the increase in the number of ads that play. I'm now done with this game."", 'The factors used to assign opponents are not fair the further along the levels you get. Playing against others with levels twice the experience. The only way to be competitive is to spend $$$, and lots of it.', ""The matchups suck, after level 6 I'm constantly having to play against people that are rated twice as high, and without paying real money, it's nearly impossible to get good enough equipment to be able to compete. Make the competition fair and this would be a good game. It was pretty fun to play up until this point."", 'Update ruined a fun game. The changes made to quests clearly sends the message that you need to PAY to participate. Videos for free tees and daily coins freeze the game. Player matching is corrupt, always against someone with at least 2x your tophies. Coin packs are seriously over priced for what you get.', ""Don't bother playing game makes you lose and will not give you clubs you need to compete on the high levels you unlock you can only upgrade the low level clubs it gives you at a very high cost then can't play anyway unless you pay pay pay this is a real money hungry game would give zero bit won't allow it"", ""This game has too many video ads. Most of the ads play too long. There is no sense listing all the issues with this game. The game developers don't care enough to even respond to comments. Find another game to play."", 'Good game would like it more if the screen would not b so sensative and it glitches from shotting the ball to zoom in and out! Need to fix that problem ASAP! lost to many tournaments games and high stakes game do to that bug! Need reimbursement!!!', ""Loved this app until I tried to login one day & an error msg popped up saying that my account had been banned for using hacks and cheats. But I've never used anything of the sort...EVER!! I dont even know how to use something like that on an app."", 'Game is ridiculous.... sometimes you win 10 straight other times you get screwed... I constantly have to face people with over double the trophies I have which makes me lose always, since they have higher and better equipment than I do...']"

It takes forever to be competitive and with all the recent changes..good luck. Changes means money for them (great) but ruins the experience for me old timer. When will companies realize there are alternatives and as a long time user a breaking point? Once, a great game has become a JOKE!"", ""Playing for many years. Great game reduced to garbage. Many bugs never addressed and updates over the last year geared toward cash to keep up. Latest major update is a blatant cash grab just to be somewhat playable for average players. Not worth the download unless you have money to burn and don't mind bugs never being fixed. Just getting worse. Changing rules with ZERO advance notice. Rank- 20 at this point. Pure garbage!"", ""There are no stars because this app absolutely sucks. I'm so tired that Everytime I like g in to this game it takes a long time, because you have to download more stuff. Everytime. This game will never be on one of my devices again. IT SUCKS That was cool. Thanks for the pep talk. I went ahead and reinstalled Golf Star. It still needs to download more stuff. Not as much as before, but it still takes forever. I don't have access to Wi-Fi most of the time. Can't see the ball"", 'Plagued with connection issues and physics inconsistencies. Played for a number of years but things have gotten worse.....plus a golf game with no course based in Scotland? Weird!! Update: absolutely ruined by connection issues now, wasted a lot of time with this app....do yourselves a favour and skip this once great game. So disappointing!', ""This used to be a very good game at one time. Then the latest update in Jan. 2020 destroyed it. It's become almost unplayable for long time players and impossible for new comers to understand and improve. The game has also become nothing but a money grab for the developers. You'll need to spend a lot of cash to increase driving distance or lower the wind speed just to make the ball stay on the course. No new courses in many years. Find a different golf game and don't waste you time or money."", ""Jan 2020 update destroyed this game for casual players. I have been playing this game for 4 years almost daily, great time killer and fun. Not anymore, if you're looking for a simple golf game, avoid this one completely. After 4 years and ecuase of the update you have to pass skill tests, and unless you want to play a tourney, with other players you can't even play a full course. Do not waste your time with this."", 'This game takes WAY too long to load. The regular start up time can take a few minutes and on top of that, if there are any additional in-game updates that need to take place, you could very well be waiting for 15 full minutes. This is a serious problem and makes what could be a really good game just about unplayable.', ""To hard to get rewards not fun playing with players with more experience, I'm new to this game put me with players I can compete with. I stopped playing no fun not having a equal chance. When you guys start putting players to compete with other players at the same level let me know, then I'll start playing again."", ""Love this game and have been playing for years now but unless I own my own server I always find I have to take time away because I simply run out of memory space to play this game.

You're grouped with others of the same skill level, but unless you spend money, you can't compete with those that have. Not fair. The graphics are great though."", ""Just like the arcade version but better with different game aspects. Haven't gotton to the point where I have to sink real money in ittostay competitive yet we'll see how much longer that will take. Not to advertisy so your not bombarded with ads or constantly being baraged with micro offer attempts. I've always been a big fan of the game so I might be a little biased.nice now that I'm a fam man and don't goto taverns to be abletoenjoy the game again without leaving my home and getting DUI lol."", ""Just like all the rest of the games out there, it's all about your credit card! No way to get gold but to use real money! You need to have someone who knows something about golf to help with this app. Dumping it now! Can't believe with all the technology that you have no one can make a decent golf game!"", 'So far so good! There can be some minor gameplay upgrades to the controls and better rewards for all contests, but overall, I like this golf game better than the others available as of now. Granted, I have only been playing for less than 2 weeks, so I hope this 5 star rating stays ;)', ""Having fun so far but I usually drop off these free to play games because I don't want to pay endless money to a game. I wish we could go back to the days of buy a game and play it all you want. When the new game comes out buy that one. That's the only reason for the 4 stars . Other than that great game !"", ""This is so far, the best golf game I've enjoyed playing above others. I witheld 1 star out of the possible 5 star for purposes of any improvement to my overall analysis through a longer period of play time/experience. Look for an edited review after the next few weeks to come."", 'Most BS golf game ever. Winds affect the ball at least 3 times more than it should. Some damn near impossible holes to par on later stages.(670 yard UPHILL hole with a 15 mph wind against you around a mountain to a 45 degree sloping green with the pin 1 yard from water) Ultra sensitive on swipes. Deleting', ""So bad. Not accurate at all. The putting is hands down the most laughable thing I've ever seen in a golf game. Cannot get accurate information on how much lower or higher a hole is from your shot. So you are constantly over or under shooting the pin. Don't waste the time it takes to download this thing. Look elsewhere."", 'A lot like the arcade game with multi player goodness. Everything is commoditized though even the ability to put backspin on a ball. With that being said, you do get the option to earn silver and gold towards clubs, balls, even clothes to try and out maneuver your opponents. Overall fun and addictive', ""Real disappointment! Controls are poor at best, with no real feedback to judge how much stroke you're using. And don't even think about putting accurately. I was expecting much better. But, like I said, REAL DISAPPOINTING. UNINSTALL!"", 'So glad that GT took the time to get this right. I wish you could add spin on each shot like in the arcade game instead of needing to use special golf balls, but I understand they need to sell in game products. Best mobile golf game by far!', ""Like the game very much except when you get to the greenI don't know what kind of mechanism or is supposed to be working for the putting green but it is effed-up I'm under par all the time until I get to the green. Then the putting just doesn't work I uninstall"", ""Super fun game, a lot like the arcade version with a few different things like backspin and wind. Hardly any ads and great gameplay. Definitely download if you're a Golden Tee fan!!"", ""Would rate less than 1 star if possible. Never actually played as after you download the app there's another HUGE download before it even loads. Gamers hate that! Just be straight with us and list the true download size, frankly I don't play games that do that. If you're dishonest concerning the download what else in the game is a lie?!?!? And I do understand that however its the consumer you must appeal to."", ""I see a lot of bad reviews...Don't believe them.Game is amazing. Thinking bad reviews have no concept of how golf works...Give this game a try you won't regret it (EDIT) Once you hit level 13 move up in ranks...Unless you spend unreal money can't compete.... UNINSTALLED DONT BOTHER"", 'Arcade is better. This is great for passing time. Has a tendency to do what it wants AI wise. Hard to get perfect straight shots. Master the curved ones to advance. I do enjoy it though.', ""The thing I love about this game is that you don't have top play against anyone. There is a challenge path that gets tougher as you go and a campaign path. I hate golf games that only allow you to play against another user."", 'Re rate again, -1 star if i could. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME! Pathetic excuse for a golf game, shot control, distance and accuracy all fail miserably. Putting is one of the worst ive experienced in a golf game, top it off its near impossible to make GIR on many of the holes. The more you play the worse it gets as the game seems to dictate how well you play. Huge disappointment as i played their RL version often. Good points, decent graphics and sounds.', 'Overall a great golf experience and the only gripe I have is with the putting. I feel needs adjustment to overall control and swing power. It just doesnt seem very well implemented. I will give 5 star once putting addressed.', ""I've just started playing the game and I'm impressed! Easy to play, a variety of different modes keeps the player interested. Great job!"", 'Takes a little learning curve to hone the shots. Played the console version before with roller ball when the bar circuit I worked at had it. Close for being on a phone app but misses the fun needling between friends and a coldie.', 'A very fun experience. Similar to the arcade. I find it to be addictive. Warning, there are a lot of mico transactions that a thrust upon the user.', ""It's kind of lame. The distance is pre-determined by the club. No user compensation. The wind is hit or miss; sometimes there's a wind effect, and sometimes not."", ""Amazing Ive played alot of golf games and this is by the best! Theres no ads pushed in your face, no pressure to buy items, mechanics are fantastic, doesn't seem like a pay to win game, this is how Mobile gaming should be, great job from the developers!"", ""Please fix and smooth out the putting. It's really chunky and not enjoyable. Smooth out the back and forth motion please. Will change to 5 stars when putting is improved."", ""Second rating after playing awhile, descent for a time they want money and hold you back Your matched with opponents by points instead of clubs or average in short you cant win if you dont spend . I'm uninstalling""]"

It's not about how strong you get your players it's about how much time and money you're spending."", ""So I really like this game, but it keeps glitching out of the game back to my home screen on my phone, and it's also really delayed when playing the game. None of my other games do this and it's getting really annoying. I also have the game on low quality. What would be the reason for this?"", ""The only big problem is that this game keep jumping out which mean it crashes. 2nd.. I really wish this game was offline like the rest of the tennis Manager games. If y'all could change that you would get more downloads from people. Offline is becoming the norm. Well you can fix my 2 small issues. So until then I have to take it off my phone. Also your game really do drains a battery bad fix this too."", ""Can't replace the trainer even after 6 months and so many updates the bug is not fixed can't play the game at all"", ""Couldn't get past the tutorial screen kept freezing whilst showing me how to recruit a new trainer in my academy shame the game had potential until that point."", ""Love the game , keeps me occupied for good amounts of time. Easy to use, I only have one request and it's a personal preference not necessary for enjoyment of the game. I wish I could control all 4 of my team plays during the season not just the one so I can upgrade all of my players quicker"", 'Cannot get passed the opening match...I picked my first player then the game just closes', 'i love the game but please fix the bug or whatever it is. its always says ""unknown error"". i wanna play this game :(', ""I can't play the game, It says I have created an account before as guest although I have never once installed this game before on my phone, either make it possible to add another account or allow us to delete an account we never created"", ""Game has some potential, I would give it a positive rating if it weren't for the constant freezing.

Please fix this problems :)', 'So many bugs guys fix the damn game', ""The last update is very bad. More achievements are added and they shouldn't be, after all these games played. New achievements are without logos and without names. They should be removed."", ""Key things to fix. Don't allow a new recruit mission when one already going without warning the other will be cancelled. Most important: why can't you retire your current player at the end of the season? It makes no sense prevents you from taking a new recruit unless you keep a spot empty. It's totally pointless, makes me want to stop playing. I really enjoy the game... But getting to the top is hard and this only makes finding the right player even harder"", 'Still a few things to be fixed, but after recent updates, the performance has skyrocketed.

I like it. Makes me wonder tho, why just 100k downloads.... This is not enough. Devs, promote the game more, with ACTUAL gameplay footage, no madeup stuff.

Some aspects of this game will make you rage due to the fact that the computer doesn't really miss shots or you could be in the same situation as them and they make it but you miss it. Also the movement is NOT fluid at all, when you are trying to run down court you end up shuffling and they end up with an open shot.

I have played this game for 2 days, and got the ""timing"" down in the first hour of gameplay... only to then learn that gold (which supposedly means more likely to go in) is 95% if the time a brick.

I have 100mb/s internet and my internet works fine. Like someone else mentioned, due to crashes you lose energy and dont get it back.

The game had very good graphics but sometimes the animations don't make sense, for example one of my players jumped through the backboard to catch a lob.

I give this game a 12/10', 'Hi EA. First of all i love the game because i love basketball a lot but there is a problem. When i open the game, it says that i must connect to the internet to play.

It's fun to start out with 60 overall players and slowly get better and better players. Right know I don't have a single player that is below 90 overall. Plus the gameplay is fun and easy.great game.

This game is getting worser. What you guys care about is earning money from this game, but not how users feel abt."", ""Good graphics & concept...plus it's free. But, the gameplay is frustrating. Rebounds are almost impossible to get, opponent hits everything while you miss wide open shots, cpu goes turbo to get loose balls...simply put is cpu has algorythmic advantage in everything.

Also kicks you off often...making you lose energy. 👀🐍's"", ""Im going to give it a 3 stars, because i got really big problem with the game. I mean the game is nice and the devs. Made so much progress.But the game is crashing on my phone literally anytime.

Awesome graphics.But it can be a lot more better in terms of gameplay like ADDING COMMENTARY and addition of skill moves, and its always good to have an option of exhibition match with different time duration.

I have no player with 90 3 point shot unfair.', ""A lot of cheaters in this game, and EA still hasn't done any thing about it, but they still expect other people to spend money, and to grind the game out. Come on EA, so many leagues buying illegal cash, and using Game Guardian to cheat in league play, but some are your own employees. I'm done wasting any thing on this game. It's gets worse every season."", ""Do not spend a cent on this game. By all means download it but do not spend a cent. The better the team you have, the more frustrating this game becomes when you see your better players missing shots that players rated way below make easy on opposing teams.

A moneymaking scam, stay well clear of this game"", ""It's fun and all and new events start often so you don't get bored. But the controls keep messing me up in almost every game. While I'm running most of the time my thumb will graze the shoot button. Then my guy will shoot from half court and mess and give them ball.

Im also a bit disapointed with the all star campaign a bit as some players are incredibly expensive to farm. Also trying to get highest overall from all star reserves pack is impossible. I tried 10 times and got tons of dupes and nothing good. I feel a bit disapointed as ever and stuck."", ""The game is good, looks realistic and fun to play.

No idea what the problem is."", ""wow, I've been playing this game for 4 years yet all the updates have been useless. no changes in the game at all, even if you have a stable connection they're not loading up. thanks for wasting my fans in showdown. shut down this game completely this is an absolute joke. y'all are doing nothing to improve this game. can't spell garbage without EA, money grabbers"", ""I like this game but the playoffs qre a bit short, and it's bad for just 1 chance.

Every campaign has one part which just cant be done so automatically I am unable to do the next part. The express performance campaign has this Murray part which just loads but doesn't open.

THEY JUST CARE ABOUT THE MONEY. The user ID is TheEngliGiants just in case."", ""This is amazing. I love the challenges they have. The only thing is its IMPOSSIBLE to beat the warriors.

Also when i click on the all star event my phone turns off after i spend my stamina', ""The reason I'm leaving the 3 star is because I can't even play the game it just kicks me off my phone back to the main screen.

Please improve so that you will continue anytime your opponent touches the ball Thank you.', ""A alright game, but quite annoying when you have to wait and when you go up for a header your player doesn't jump."", 'This game makes no sense what so ever. The goal keepers suddenly turn into gods as i place a shot in the top corner. Yet i can do a not so good shot and it go it as that is what the game wants me to do. Completely ignores the fact tha you can play your own game and unique way when you are forced into making decisions that the game tells you to do. However, i really like the concept of the game, its just that i cant get along with how stupid the AI can be at times. Totally ruined the experience.', ""I wanted to like this game so I put up with the AI being totally idiotic. It would only happen one or two times, but they've become even worse in higher levels. They run out of play, have the worst touch ever, run into an opponent etc. You spend money to get tickets to replay a scenario only for them to do the same thing. The developers will not change anything as this is their money maker, so now I just let hearts replenish in time. Player stats like speed & touch would be good if introduced."", ""This game is fun but sometimes it can be quite stupid. You kinda have to make the pass that the game wants you to. Goalkeepers can randomly turn into absolute gods. You might make a pass and the player takes the biggest touch you've ever seen. It's constantly asking me to watch ads. Also even it takes the slightest deflection of the defender, but you still get the ball you actually lose. The energy runs out too quickly coz of all of this But otherwise it's good..."", ""good app. but the higher you advance the worse your team play. you select a player and pass the ball to them and they don't advance the ball. I was stuck for about 20 kicks between 2 player with no other option. also, when you do a through pass the players no longer run towards the ball. they side step and don't reach the ball before the defender. play lazy and garbage like. the creators should make the defenders better the higher you advance rather than making your players worse."", ""It's a fun game at the start but as you progress it just gets really frustrating. The players have no idea what their doing, when you get the ball your person either just turns into the opposing player or runs the ball out. Sometimes I am at stage 4 of level and I through ball it to my player and they take one touch at the centre circle and they stop, so your forced to shoot. And the goalkeepers are just insanely good, really, really good they save a shot 5m from goal. I give the game 2 stars."", ""Alright game, keeper can be overpowered sometimes and it kinda just sits on my homescreen not enough to bring me back to it. But saying that does have some redeeming qualities. For a mobile game the graphics are ok. It can be fun and it's the right amount of challenge at times. Overall give it a try and if you don't like it just delete it."", ""Sometimes it's fun, but then it can get frustrating for the following reasons: - You don't get to play the ball where you really want to. The game makes you focus on one particular area. So for example, there was only one teammate I could pass to, but he was already offsides. So the game pretty much forces me to pass to an offside player, thus making me lose a heart. - I'll pass to a player and they start dribbling. All of a sudden, a defener tackles them. There goes another life/10 credits."", 'Overall, this game is quite innovative and the idea is great. The AI for the game just makes it 3 stars for me. Very often the pass will be directly towards the player and the AI dribbles the ball right into the legs of an opposing player and decides to pass then. Also I have had a number of occasions where the player would dribble the ball in a straight line away from the goal and out of bounds. Another being that when I have given a player a perfect setup, they shoot from nearly midfield.', ""This is an absolutely terrible game. It may work for others, but honestly. It is totally unrealistic. No tackles involved whatsoever. Sometimes the opposing team's player has their foot right against the ball when you are about to kick😐. Your own team it's self, sometimes can't even jump to get a head on the ball.😐 Sometimes your own player might dribble the ball off the field. Like ball control please! And even when they do have a good touch they can't keep it. Honestly Score Match is better."", ""Generally a good game. Graphics are good and the gameplay is easy and smooth. However the glitches are infuriating! Sometimes it takes ages to score and get onto the the part of the stage and then for some inexplicable reason, the player in possession will run with the ball until it's out of play, losing your progress and health. It happens a lot!"", ""I do like this game, a nice simple concept, but when you get to later stages, your team turns rubbish. They almost NEVER head the ball, despite the 3rd level saying it PREVENTS interceptions. Sometimes I can't even KICK because an opponent is in the way. Keepers save everything too. The Energy system is a huge waste of time, just give us unlimited chances without forcing us to pay."", ""Very irritating game mechanics from time to time. When you pass the ball to a team mate, and the opposition stands directly in front of the ball, making it un winnable, doesn't matter where you send the ball. Would like to see more control over the character, power control could be useful too. Otherwise a decent game."", ""Good god am I trying to like this game, but it's freaking difficult to do. If you're not going to let me control how my players move or react to things like pressure, you better make darn sure your AI is competent. Getting tired of placing a really nice through pass for someone just to have them watch it roll by to a defender. Getting to FIFA levels of of stupid here!"", ""Good game but the ai is really frustrating. Many times now I'll have had a player take the ball from the middle of the field to the sideline and thus I lose a life/heart. Also sometimes the screen will stop for me to kick, only to have an opposition player literally kissing the ball...good bye another heart"", ""It's not terrible but the AI is so utterly ret@rded you will want to throw your phone, you'll get the ball to a player that the game didnt want you to use and he will run all the way back to your keeper and out of bounds or they'll just run straight into an opposing player with no control. And they dont know how to pass AND the AI just straight up cheats and lunges suuuuper far for the ball or your player will back off of the ball just so you give up possession, unbelievably frustrating."", ""Horrible just Horrible controls. I make a line the other team gets possession. Every level 1-20 is terrific the other teammates ACTUALLY play from 1-20. But 20 and up it's just horrible. Your teammates won't move unless I do a through ball, also why won't they run to the ball that is being passed to them another thing I lose possession then I gain it again then I have to restart? Ummm what!!!!!???? Also the other team is so good almost every pass I make goes to the other team!"", 'The energy bar sucks, it makes me hope i dont get a hard level because ik it will take up most of my play time so the satisfaction of beating a hard level can take days when i just move onto another game instead of paying to play. can do weird things like needing to score on the side of the net where the goalie is defending but the open side will get lock down defense. Also when your player is running straight at the goal they will pass the ball. Still one of my favorite soccer games for mobile.', ""It's okay game. But there always some stupid situations. And another thing which always piss me off is even though my hero is American and plays for USA national team its always weird that I dont feel it. When its continental cup few times its called European cup. Or when he moves to American club they show it something different thing for him. There are so many other issues like that. Creators should've given more attention to make it realistic"", ""Terrible. The levels are fun I'll give them that, but the energy system is just ridiculous. You can only play for about 3 minutes before you run out if you're aiming to 3 star each level. Also, speaking of the star objectives, it doesn't tell you what those objectives are at the first run of the level, only after it's done, wasting more energy and time. Finally, I miss the old version of this game, where you had real life situations to replicate. This career version couldve be a separate game."", ""Score! Hero gaming app is a very addicting game, as I use my fingers to play the ball wherever I need it to go to. It's a very challenging, but fun game to play. There might be some slight errors, like when the person you passed it to acts kind of off and let's the ball leave his sight, but overall this game gets me hiped up to play fifa with my friends and family. Very great game, and I hope that the creators continue to update this app."", ""The game is brilliant, the controls are intuitive and the 'levels' are cleverly disguised within the story of your player. The only problem is, you can't play any of it. This game uses an 'energy / lives' system wherein whenever you lose possession of the ball, you lose one sliver of a heart. If you are out of hearts you can pay £3 to refill all 4 hearts...otherwise you must watch up to 90 seconds of ads for only 2 parts of a heart back. There is no way to remove ads or get infinite hearts."", ""The game has the potential to be great, but needs a few little tweaks. Right now, it is so infuriatingly difficult. Starting the negatives. One massive issue is the moronic AI. If I pass to someone facing the camera, they run with the ball the wrong way & run the ball out, thus failing that scenario. Another point I severely dislike, is when a scenario fails. Why can't I not be reset for that scenario only, & reset the whole match if I leave for the main menu. Apart from that, it is a solid game"", 'Not a free flowing soccer game so much as a unique puzzle game. The action pauses as the player decides to pass or shoot, then you decide the next move. You need to figure out the pattern without the opposition touching the ball. Love the original idea, the good graphics and well animated players. If you want a soccer themed puzzle then this is great.', ""I love this game, however there are a few things I'd change. I really want to be able to play for smaller English clubs like Everton (who I support), can you make it that we can choose any club? Like if We have a choice for an English club, we can choose any English club? Would also like to see a trophy room listing all the trophies you've won, and an ability to stay with a club longer than 2 years would be good, but it is a gr8 game."", 'The most adorable game, but in the same time the most annoying game. Some of levels can cause even depresia. Interception by enemy is one issue, but the most horibble thing is enemy goalie who is almost teleporting to save a shot. Another thing is the way how your players behave. Sometimes you can pass a ball to him and he run through the whole pitch just to be stopped at the last moment by defender. If these things were fixed, this game would be awesome.', 'Addictive and frustrating. Players keep running out even when no opposition around, some even 1/4 of the pitch until they out. Players often dont jump for headers, you only know the specific requirements for 3* until after you completed the level. No real consistency from the players when you moving the ball around. Overall, this could be a fantastic game but needs a little bit of work.', ""Such a waste that this game is as terrible as it is cos it has a lot of potential. The first 10-20 levels are easy but then the glitches come in thick and fast, the CPU will run out of play for no reason or your perfectly aimed pass will be headed away. Worst of all is scoring on the higher levels, I've watched the walkthrough for level 207 and I still cant score the goal to complete that section."", ""This game could be so cool. Unfortunately you are forced into A LOT of things. You can only pass in the direction it offers which isnt always the ideal pass. Your players will literally just run out of bounds with the ball for no reason or run straight into defending players. Sometimes when you shoot the goalkeeper/defender uses instant transmission. You're only allowed to play the game for so long because of the stamina. Cool game but very limited in some ways."", ""Give the players some common sense and stop giving me so many ads. If you don't count that, it is very fun and addictive. However it glitches and when I go to pass, it stops halfway and the other team intercept. I like the way that you get really excited when you finish a difficult level. It still needs some updates and improvements."", ""The game has potential to be interesting but it gets to a stage where you players are useless and the goal keeper is almost impossible to score against. It's too clear they try hard to push sales of rewind tickets. Solution is to just wait for lives to replenish themselves."", 'U must be joking, after more that month I lost all progress, some conflict with YOUR local cloud and basically game put me back almost on the start....rubbish. If cant run your game properply, dont waste peoples time.....same with Match Hero....what a shame...DONT DOWNLOAD!!!!! And Adv literally EVERYWHERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!', 'score hero is a game which is very challenging for every person..those who was play the game he/she know that how to controll this game and got 3 star..no doubt to say that it is very challengable and enjoyable............but it is true that its a addicting game...whatever it is gives us fun and enjoy.............', 'I do enjoy the game but what really bugs me is when I pass the ball to a teammate the either run into the defender or out of play when they had plenty of room to move and then I lose my stamina because if that. On top of that sometimes when the players are on the ball and the opportunity to pass come it puts me in an impossible position where no matter what I do I get tackled, so all that needs to be fixed for this game to be brilliant.', ""Soo many adds being thrown at you, that when you want to watch one for stamina or a replay they aren't available. You are expected to wait 10 minutes for one sliver of life or purchase at a ridiculous price. Also, it takes soo many tries to complete a level and the bots continually blocking the ball at any angle does not help. Needs a save point and goals need to stated before the level, not after! It's an ok game, veeeerrrrrryyyyy frustrating and I'm un installing."", ""The players just keep dribbling the ball until it gets past the line, is it the way you play football out there? I think you don't know the difference between '' possession'' and '' touch'', the opponent just has a mere touch on ball and it costs us a rewind, this should be fixed"", 'People go through eachother, mostly enemies. The GoalKeeper is a literal tryhard with ""aimbot"". this game is designed to make you rage. just saying. Yeah, also when you give the ball to someone they get slower and slower for having the ball and then the enemy takes the ball. And when you try to do a goal the goalkeeper like is frozen before the ball gets 1mm close to him/her/it,', ""Great game but is there an issue in the past 24 hours? All my players seem to want to do is keep running with the ball until there out of play or run in to an opposition player. Very frustrating when you only get some many attempts then have to wait a while until you've refuelled. It's done this the odd time before but past 24 hours it's been constant to the point its becoming unplayable""]"

The opponent also keeps on covering the goal which doesn't let you score. I don't even think that's something that you do in the actual sport. The game also gives you an opponent that's 30 levels ahead of you! Even on easy fields! It wastes my coins because of this. An ad also pops up after I'm done with a game while in the past it didint. The competitions are fun and all but they are WAY too short! I also love how the croud cheers when you score."", ""Could be so much better! 1. Allow ball to be passed by it touching your own player, if it doesnt play passes to opponent. 2. Have a player designated as Goalkeeper that automatically returns between posts, this would make for longer games as: 3.

I have problems playing this game in it, the clerk said it's because the game is not designed for that high number of android and you should wait till the updates of the game. I want to know if he is right. And can somebody tell me which level of android this game is designed for?"", ""Can't choose username or profile picture. Too many unavoidable requests for money. Interesting gameplay though the slight 3D effect exaggerates the skill curve. It would be better if it was flat and used less battery."", 'Best soccer game ever. Love this game!! After you win alot though, I feel like the game tries to cheat you with missing shot and giving them the most lucky shot ever. Other than that this game is pretty amazing!!!!!! Please try this game out :)', ""Game is abosulety terrible, I win one match then I'm put against some 174 leveled dude and I lose like 10000 coins, game is insanely rigged. Do not install this game.

I love that no matter how wealthy a player is, it makes no difference in game play. This is a game of pure skill, patience and persistence. 10/10', ""My only problem with this game is the pentaly rush. The fire balls (×2) sometimes does not register properly. Also, I've beaten my penalty high score plenty of times and does not register anymore. It is stuck at 102 and I've gotten as high as 109. Other than that, it's a great competitive game!

The days of Flash Player are over and so is Miniclips integrity."", ""The game is overall fun, but it has many issues. For one, the ads are incredibly annoying. I mean, they take forever to load, AND forever to exit. Then, the opponents the game gives you are sometimes 50 levels or more ahead of you, even on normal fields. The game should be working your way up, not throwing everything it has at you. at first the game is pretty fun, but then it starts getting more boring.

There are mini games which allow you to win a lot of money in the game.

This an important update and all users should update their app in order to continue using this game's services.","[""Great game but I'm sick and tired of having to do 30-40 trials to get the team I want to start with. Should be more than one team impressed with your trial. And it gets boring once you've bought everything. End up with 40 horses which take ages to race. You need to rethink the later stages because it becomes monotonous."", ""This game is fun to play, and it is challenging to keep having good results. There should be a way of recharging energy over time, or have a sleep option, if not you need to keep drinking and buying more drinks. I am also unhappy that since I bought the no-ads pack, I don't have the option anymore to gladly watch special ads in order to gain some more coins at the end of games, or some more energy to complete a training. This is just stupid. Very shame, since the game is actually interesting."", ""Fun game but frustrating. Too often feels like one step forward 3 steps back. A bad interview can almost completely wipe out a perfect game. Random mishaps set your skills back far too often. Feels like things happen solely to slow down your progress. I understand there needs to be a challenge but when it's at every single turn it gets old. Very fun but also frustrating at times."", ""Enjoying this game immensly, feels like you are starting at the bottom, and improving with every game & practise session. Shame that you need to pay significant real world $$s to progress & do well, esp with all the advertising that's embedded. Still, as a football fan, enjoying the game"", ""It's very useful and entertaining. It shows you ways to become a pro and help with decison making but sometimes it barely gives any chances and give the computer too much goals at the start of the match. Granted you get more chances when you are captain. So yeah"", ""Just good fun. I've been playing this game for a few months now. I really like that there is actually something to this game. I can build and grow my dude ( like buying property and race horses and his skills). And getting those guys that give me money each match I play, I forgot their names. I also prefer the older version look to it better. Glad they give the option of new and old. But a good game to disappear from for a while and come back and play real quick."", ""The game is fun but it is ruined by stupid ai. Sometimes teammates catch the ball from 10 metres away whilst other times they just stand there and don't do anything. Kicking the ball is also annoying. Sometimes you hit it at the bottom and it goes to bloody outers pace whilst other times it barely reaches the goalie/teammate"", ""One of the most neglected game in the mobile world. The developers seem to cease improving it since 2018. I played this game since 2016. Which makes me kinda sad. The game is kinda buggy now. Sometimes, when you start a new profile, your character won't have any sponsors or national team call ups. You'd have to restart a new character and pray to God it doesn't have the bug. Also, the teams all froze in 2018. So no Sheffield or Wolverhampton in the Prem."", ""Very addictive soccer game! ...There is another one just like this, but I like the mechanics of this one 'a lot' better, even though 'that other one' has better graphics. This is a labour of love, and it shows! PRO-TIP: You can restart a match (if you're losing for example) by force-closing the game in the 'active applications' android menu. Have fun... I barely have a social life left now due to this 'game', thanks developers! :')"", ""Fantastic, extremely addictive...suggestion can we have detailed stats on competitions like how many goals have I scored in the league and cup plus getting transfer offers from teams in different leagues....i prefer playing on the classic interface but it doesn't show all the groups in cups and competitions like the modern interface"", 'Requires a lot of patience and sometimes the game cannot continue unless you spend coins and buy Energy Drinks. Apart from that, it is a gem of a game. Some improvements in gameplay would be welcome though.', 'Its amazing. Its basically a simulation of a football career. Recommended this for offline users and people that are pursuing their dreams of being a talented footballer The controls are easy. Its lag-free. Plus, its free. Play this. Really, I mean it. Play it', ""Love this game! Been playing since 2012 on iOS and Android and it's easily the greatest game on the play store / app store on my opinion. I have an issue though, after 3-4 seasons your sponsors get waaaay worse, if you don't get 10s each game, your sponsors will go down by like 3-9 levels, it gets really hard to play with sponsors who hate you. But the gameplay is amazing throughout the years. And the side features are quality."", ""Could be a great game... Is a fun basic game , however...the ball sometimes just bounces of teammates and they don't run for the ball. You can have full relations (team/fans/manager) have 3 star stamina and be full attacking but not get a chance on the ball for full halfs while the other team can score 3 goals one after the other. The annoyance of these little things far outweigh the few positives of the game. Dont bother is my conclusion. Not to mention the amount of ads on this game is dumb."", ""Constant pressure from adverts ruins the game. Adverts automatically appear after every match and it really disrupts the flow and enjoyment from the game. It is a clear push from the developers to get you to pay to remove ads which in turn ruins the whole experience further. It's a shame, but uninstalling as more experience more frustration than fun."", 'A sweet game indeed.......but the only issue I have is the increase in the price of the energy drink, which increases as your star rating increases, which I never expexcted to be so. But I still rate it 100%.', ""I played this years ago and it was decent. They have absolutely ruined it by going nuts with monetising every aspect and making it so that ads popup while you're playing and when they do it doesn't pause the game. So you finish the advert and then find out you failed your skill challenge or your team lost. Honestly don't waste your time."", 'What can one say but what an exceptional game for phones. Might I suggest a celebration where maybe the little figurines run off into the corner when a goal is scored. Otherwise fantastic! 5 star all the way! New Star all the way!', 'Great game, been playing it for years on and off... tip for everyone who thinks you need to spend real money... load up on energy drinks while your star level is low as they are cheaper then you can always stay in front. And load up just before you reach the next level. Your welcome', ""You have to watch ads to be allowed to play games or practice skills. And your teammates will super hate you if you don't buy stuff with them every other week, despite earning just a measly 1-2 gold per match.."", ""Great game, bit annoying that your energy doesn't refill by it self after some time and that you have to spend your money on buying a can before you can play again."", ""The game is really good but to improve could you change about playing for your national team because i don't like how when you play in a different league that is different from your national team you can't play for your national team"", 'Ended up installing as way too many ads and clearly pay to win - essentials like energy get more expensive as you progress (and faster than earnings do), making it very difficult without purchasing and ending up being an unrewarding grind. Fix these two things and you would have an amazing game but disappointed at the moment.', ""Better than perfect soccer. This is a diamond in the rough. I'd like to have more training with less energy drainage. Something I can play more continuously"", 'could be much better as when making a pass, that player should pass again if there is an opponent in front of him it is quite stupid passing and your teammates shouts in a opponent. also there are not enough coins to be given, how can you improve your lifestyle section when playing for a big team and only few coins are given, how can you maintain a player with not enough money. also shooting could be much more improved and making the goal post a little bigger too.', 'I like this game very much because it is entertaining and fun. Personal speaking it should work a bit on graphics and player speed but other than that it is amazing and i also like the fact that it inculdes the fane boss relationships team and also sponsors and lifestyle choices aswell. You should install this app now😂😝', ""Terrible. After you finish the first three years, it get bad. All of the players run super-fast, like a bunch of Usain Bolts chasing after you. Also, your teammates get worse. If you try to pass to one, they usually don't receive the ball, even if you pass directly to them. It sucks."", ""Excellent, I've recently gone back to this gem after a few years in the wilderness, still a great game, the new version of not add got at the old ones, luckily you can go back to the old school one."", 'Playing for 30 minutes, So far so good. Wish there was a way to earn money a little faster and give a countdown as to when energy would refill.', ""Every time I'm winning you make the opposing team scored like three goals in one minute when it's 89 minutes left and it's so annoying and everytime from 80 to 90 I have no position why this game need to fix this"", 'New Star Soccer is a great sports simulation game, but it can improve by making the players sometimes control the ball, when necessary.', ""Played the original way back when, thought I'd try it again I like the modern look and the fact you can revert back to the original graphics. I like the addition of the casino and gambling just remember legal age to gamble is 18 😂."", ""This is the best soccer game out there. I'm not a soccer fan but have been looking for a sports game for that you can play your own career mode. You guys nailed it! Now just go make a american football basketball and baseball app similar to this. Great game!"", ""Game would be better if you could gain more coins faster as everything costs more than you can gain. This is a game for someone who has alot of money to throw at it. The idea for the game is great but the reality is that I can't afford to throw my life savings at it."", ""Great game. A real time time killer. Only suggestion I have is to include a tutorial at the beginning of the game. Otherwise it's great"", 'Great, awesome game, but my advice is PLAY OFFLINE, always. They randomly force you to watch ads for 5s and provide no rewards where watching ads for rewards is available.', ""An expetacle. I like a lot this game. But just have a problem. They put the ball a lot of times in the entry of area and my mobile phone doesn't works there so I need to restart the game but. That's my problem. Tks for the game. <3 👍😊"", 'Very addictive, played for around 3 hours straight on the first day of having it, as phone games go, this one is done well.', 'Unlimited ads. Zero payouts. Lots of gameplay that reduces your energy to force you into ads or micro transactions. Avoid like the plague.', ""It can be frustrating that my players won't get the ball and won't score. But all in all I like making fun of my brother because he doesn't have a girlfriend and I do. This is a terrific game but needs some look into it to be better ;)""]"

Few years ago, the match was fun and fair, the challenge to unlock the characters were also reasonable.

Whenever i used iceland powershot, if the match ends while i still in iceland powershot form, the game automatically crashes itself. Please fix this immediately and i will give you 5 stars.', 'I play this game for many years (when we only had characters until the alien) ... I really do not have a bad image of the game, it is always fun to play and discover new challenges and characters. my only advice for the developers is that they fix the fact that in the survival mode F rank hats appear even when you are in a rank Ss game, is frustrating as you play so much to get only some hats of this rank, forced to play again many matches and so have some luck at some time.']"

But the cons are that the game freezes and u lose everything. The in app purchases are OUTRAGEOUS! $5 per stadium is ridiculous! And u will need a 2nd job just to buy more coins. Plain stupidity charging that much. But again the MLB doesn't care about their fans as long as they get paid. And what's with the new jerseys? It's just wasting cards we earn and give us no actual benefit. I feel like they just made a game and don't actually care if we have fun or not."", 'terrible, waste of time i played this gm for a few months, spent actual money on stadiums. reached level 70 then the app stayed froze on the logo open screen for 3 days, after which it restarted me back at level 1. after a few half hearted attempts to help from the developers, i have given up after hearing nothing for 3 days now. what was once a big part of not only my day, but my wifes too, is now just another uninstalled app in the memory of our time wasted.', 'The distances for home runs are ludicrous. No one has ever hit a 700 foot homer. Make the game more realistic. Also, home run derby pitches are all meatballs, not curves, sliders, or knucklers. It is a fun game, but not realistic at all.', ""Game doesn't play fairly. Some players are able to hit pitches further and get pitches thrown to them faster. This is counterintuitive because the further a ball travels, the less time you have to bat. The game clearly gives some players an advantage. I know launch angle affects the time a ball carries, so I swing flatter to get pitches faster but then don't get the distance. I have to be at over a 40° launch angle to hit 800 foot HRs & that slows the rate at which pitches are delivered."", ""Pisses me off!! I not only invested money into this game, but A LOT of time as well!! Never really had any issues until I hit level 52....Now it won't let me back into the game AT ALL!!!! Take it from someone who put MONEY and A LOT OF TIME INTO IT..... DON'T SPEND ANY OF YOUR MONEY ON THIS GAME!! I GIVE IT 5 👎👎👎👎👎"", 'I wish it didnt cost so much for different stadiums and upgrades to players/equipment. I find playing the Arcade mode it is very hard to hit home runs. Great game otherwise. The Derby and Multiplayer modes are fun. I play every day.', ""Would rate higher but something needs to be done about playing at Tropicana Field. The stupid catwalks take away too many home runs, and even using the Called Shot boost which is supposed to make every hit a home run, balls hit the catwalk and aren't home runs. Other than that I love this game"", ""The game in itself is a great game but the customer service is extremely poor overall. I have been playing since October and after researching discovered I have invested over $250 into the game. BIG MISTAKE. The game locked up losing all progress twice and I reached out to MLB with no luck. It turns out, I had two emails and they won't help me merge the accounts or restore my data. I know they have the ability to help but choose not to. DO NOT SPEND $$ ON THIS GAME...NOT WORTH IT FOLKS."", ""Batting pitcher throwing sliders, and curves, since when do they do that in a H.R contest. Very, very VERY EXPENSIVE!!! Licenced by MLB, cost is outrageous. Don't they have enough money, could have just gave back to the fans and not charged!!! I WOULD NEVER PAY THOSE PRICES. You ACTUALLY have to pay for each individual stadium to play in it, $4.99 ea. Do not recommend never."", 'I like the game so far. It would be nice to have bigger bucks rewards than coins. A batting button on the left or right of the screen so you know where to tap to hit. There are a few glitches. In some stadiums, you can hit a towering homerun , that leaves the park and still not count as a homerun and some homeruns count when it didnt clear the fence.', 'Overall it\'s a good game. BUTTTTTTT......As many have said changing in pitches especially when your killing it. As well as PVP you either have to be way out in front with HRs. Or ""competition"" catches up with you by hitting multiple HRs...which are impossible for you to do. Stadiums are way too expensive. MLB never has appreciated us as fans when it comes to their merchandise. Cheap quality over inflated prices. Seems the norm. MLB will say you want a piece of your team you have to pay.', ""Fix your damn game. Inconsistent distances, timer still runs in arcade mode, haven't seen a legend card since you started doing those dumbass uniforms, even from a platinum pack. My play of this game has gone to next to nothing because of these bs problems. Haven't seen anything but a bronze pack from the last 50 multi player wins. Add on the fact that it is freezing now with a pop up offer at the beginning. Wish i could give it -5 stars to off set someone else's good rating."", ""BEWARE. Just like everyone else says...you get over level 50 and the app just locks up on the opening screen. I've already had my reset once and built it back up and now it's locked up for over a week. Don't bother."", 'I cant believe how many bugs this game has. Besides the actual in game problems now i have one of the games many attempts to try and get you to spend money stuck at the opening screen and whoever the brilliant programmers are for this game made it impossible to close and I can no longer play the game at all. I can not even get into the game at app because of this pop up thats stuck blocking the entire screen. This game would be decent if the programmers did their easy job correctly.', ""Fun to play, but... After you work your way up to level 50 or higher, the game locks up. My other phones are stuck 😡. Game won't load. I've spent money and collected many limited and classic players. Waste of my time and money. I paid for those cards."", ""It's fun for awhile. I dont understand why the pitches change late in rounds from fastball to change/curve/efus. Doesnt make it very realistic. If Harper's dad would have thrown junk, Bryce might have thrown a bat at him Edit (additional 12/21/19): In the head to head mode, I'm not sure how it's possible that the competition is able to hit HRs significantly faster. I have had quite a few competitions where I've hit a normal HR and my opponent hits two in the same amount of time"", 'Great game but way too many software bugs. The game freezes at least once a week to the point I have to uninstall and reinstall the game. Fortunately, I have a profile that has saved my progress.', 'Takes money to win, home run derby is almost impossible to win unless you spend money on better equipment. They match you ""randomly"" with someone who hits way more HR""s then you because they have either spent money or are way higher ranked and have alot unlocked. They also throw curve balls, if you aim low they pitch high and if you aim high they throw a curve or low. I have never seen a HR deby pitcher throw curve balls. Ridiculously out matched.', ""Pretty good game.. thoroughly enjoyable though could be easier or simple like to unlock things as I've been playing for a while and it's taking it's time all in all good game tho game is currently having issues.. I can't get past an advert for something in game related or it continuously gives me the daily login reward repeatedly I'm heading for the same 24-hour period.. Hope this just a bug issue.."", 'Played for a few months, just long enough for me to level up and get good at, then the game freezes up, forcing me to uninstall.

It stopped counting my stats for the leaderboard. And I bought the alumni pack and it's not giving my credit for buying it."", 'How is it the computer can throw faster, run faster and know where I am throwing the damn ball before I even throw it. I can be up by 10 but the computer is gonna come back and totally blow my ass away. You get 5 stars for frustrating and pissing me off. Otherwise I loved the first and original R.B.I from the Nintendo days.', ""good baseball game on mobile problem is I'm been trying to unlock the Brooklyn Dodgers Jersey -score a Grand slam with a pinch hitter."", 'At least the season saves unlike 16.', 'To hard bad graphics', 'I like it so far see what happens', 'Best Game Ever. Be the Indians Or the Orioles', 'Greater the first', 'Good very good', 'I want a refund', 'I love it when I am pitching a perfect game into the 8th inning and then out of nowhere the computer cranks 3 straight home runs. As hard as it is to hit a home run for me I am glad they made it exponentially easier for the computer to do so. I have had multiple games where I have given up only 4 hits. The fun part? Magically they were all home runs. Gimme a break. Maybe tone down the ""comeback"" feature and make the A.I. a little more realistic.', ""Kinda fun but the programming is definitely biased against the player.   I've seen opposing team fielders catch balls four feet away from them.   I've been called out after getting to the base before the ball does yet the the AI is called safe even though the base had been tagged.   Oh,  and gotta love the first pitch home runs the game gives itself.   Yet, I keep playing.   Truly,  hope does spring eternal."", ""There are two big things that urk me. 1) There's no saving of any kind. The app can be minimized, but if it eventually gets closed when it's in the background, your game is gone. 2) It downloads roster updates here and there, but I don't notice any actual change to my lineups. Same lineup as the first day of the season."", ""If season mode kept stats it would be perfect. Game play is smooth but a save game function would be nice. If you've ever played baseball video games, it's not nearly as difficult as everyone is saying. Sure you don't strike out every batter or drop bombs every other pitch but who wants that? Great game."", 'Been using a Nintendo Emulator to play the old RBI. This is 100x better!! Bought game 6/20/14 but the AI everyone complains about is pretty easy , I did use assisted fielding though. Wish it was harder. Put up 18 hits & 2 HRs in my two games. Game is smooth, full roster, full season(option to play short season). Love the newspaper game summary at the end too.  Great work to keep the gameplay like the original!!! UPDATE: Dropped 1 star after playing for 10+ games.', ""It is the same game we all grew up with! Well if your in your late thirties or early forties, you will feel like you are 14 and playing on a Friday night with pizza and friends! Today's gamers won't like it. Old school fans will be reminiscent of youth! I for one love it!"", ""This comes after two full short seasons!  it's OK! Not great... But with a few tweaks could be awesome.  First, the game needs to give you a tiny bit more time between innings to take a breath especially before you get up to bat. Second, I would really appreciate even simple stat collection such as how many hits a batter has gotten in a game... What a pitcher's era is etc. Also please tell me who just hit the homerun. The names disappear too quickly.  the graphics are awesome. End"", ""I loved it but I wish it had online multiplayer to play friends and family. Also, when is RBI Baseball 15 coming out for Android? I'm dying with the wait. It's on ios and the Xbox One but not Android. Please let the release be soon. Thanks guys! Keep up the good work!"", 'The game is fun but it just feels empty. Everyone who loves baseball loves the stats which this is completely lacking.  Season mode feels like exhibition mode except you cant pick what team you play againsy for 162 games...  the gameplay is pretty fun but just gets stale after a while because of the lack of depth and with very similiar game modes, this leaves a lot to desire', ""The graphics and overall setup are not that bad, but game play is horrible.  It is way too hard to hit, and often there's a glitch right when it's time to swing and you can't possibly hit it.  Hopefully they fix a few things, but I can't recommend buying right now.  I don't think I'd even get it for free."", 'Do NOT Buy until an update is applied!!!  The developers never played the original, which is apparent playing this POS game.  Perfect pitch and you barely hit out past the pitchers mound.  While you try to jam the CPU and they crank it out.  Go ##;;/=()/  yourself with your BS game.', ""I don't understand how so many errors are made on defense with computer assisted controls on. How easy it is for the computer opponent to get hard contact on balls pitched off the plate. Base running controls are bad. Can only swipe for a double after the player arrived at 1st. Pitchers wear down after 3-4 innings. An OK game but not great like you would expect from MLBAM"", 'I love this game more than any other. It has everything I want. Except for the fact I bought the alumni pack and none of the players showed when I had the current roster choice. I had to go to original roster and then it showed up. I would love to still play with Jose Abreu so if you could fix that it would be great', 'I can understand releasing the game for console first. But This is two years in a row where the season has already began and android users are left sitting on the bench while iOS users can play. Pathetic in all areas', ""Decent game play, but the games are predetermined. It is possible to hit, I've had games with 24 hits. The idiotic thing is that the game winner is predetermined. Many games, leading by 5 or so, bottom of the ninth, bottom of the order, low batting average hitters, and the cpu slams 3 hrs in a row, few doubles and there's another loss. Happens far to much to be coincidence. The game is rigged. If they had degrees of difficulty, maybe, but this is just idiotic. Waste of space."", ""Computer is too difficult to play and  the controls are unresponsive.  Good looking graphics but very frustrating because it favors the computer.  Doesn't seem like a fare contest.  Thought in time like all other games that you can improve, but no such luck in 3 months of playing it on regular base.  Going to delete it and toss it up to a bad purchase."", 'The developers of this game should be fired immediately.  This is an insult to the orig and way for some tools to make 5 bucks off of a guy here a guy there.  The gameplay and its results are so counterintuitive and inaccurate its embarrassing. But hey!  Get your ulumni kit for $1.99.  This game absolutely sucks.  It does.  It.sucks so badly I want my money back, and the criteria for how.a player hits the ball where and how is for not.  I still play the first game and its 10 times as realistic as this junk.', 'Not an enjoyable game to play at all. I am all for nostalgia, but the UI is just terrible. I have played 13 games and I have only won one of them. I can usually only eek out 3 runs a game if I am lucky. I regret this purchase', 'Love this game. No management, just play. It gets a little frustrating at some points but overall it is great. Its also is a lot easier to change teams then the few apps that actually use an mlb team. People say it is to difficult, and people say that is how arcade games work but it is not diffucult', ""I don't know what everyone's problem is. This is not as difficult as everyone says. 2nd game won 3-2 in 13 innings. Just like the the game I remember. Stop moving your batter around, and mix up your pitches."", 'I was really let down by this game. I have longed for a playable baseball game forever on my droid, and this is not it. the interface is so slow and frankly the computer cheats. I don\'t understand why baseball on my old sega genisus and playstation 1 was so much better then what we are getting foisted on us. my Samsung tablet bows the computer and graphic power of those out of the water yet this is the kind of stuff we keep getting. go get EA sports ""triple play"" game engine and make it run on android and you would make a fortune.', ""This is a great game to spend your time. It lacks some extra things like the option to dive for the ball etc. I don't know how people say it is too difficult. My problem is that I can't lose. I have to take the worst team to even challenge myself."", ""I've read a lot if the reviews here and the ones who complain seem to be missing the point of this game. The original RBI Baseball didn't have all the customizations or settings people seem to look for. It was a basic game with a set roster and settings. So too is RBI 14. Great job on the game. True fans love a classic and this is no exception."", 'Mlb fail miserably on this contract. Follow mlb home run derby and then its a blast. Computer is to difficult to beat. Throwing out at base and says safe come on that BS. Pitching sucks and player view is as if i was in the nose bleeds or in the third terrace tucked in the corner. Dont waste the $5 you will regret. Oh incase i. Forgot this game blows....', ""Don't waste your money. The game is beyond difficult, there's no learning curve, there's no common sense to the fielding, there's too many errors, and even with an all-star team you won't beat the worst team in the game. The strike zone is inconsistent. The game is not worth the 5 bucks they charge, and unless they can tweak it to where there's an easier mode or the pitches are slower, then it is an absolute do not buy!!!!!"", ""I can't tell you how many times I've had to rage quit this game because the computer hits a home run off the first pitch. Also, the computer magically knows to steal whenever you throw a slow pitch, and it's impossible to throw the runner out. Even more, after shelling out five bucks for this terrible game, they have the chutzpah to try and charge for more content. Don't bother with this one."", 'This game is great and challenging! Its not hard, you need to figure it out! Try stealing a base everynow and then....I love it and cant wait for more updates. Everyone needs to stop complaining...', ""Just one thing. Glitchy distance signs on the outfield walls. I suggested to fix in an email to the developers and have yet to see any results. As a matter of fact they sent a message back saying they're open to suggestions...?? Its not a suggestion when it SHOULDNT be happening. Are you going to fix it??!"", ""My dog could've created a better game! Too limited, controls unresponsive at times, computer cheats at times, costing hits and runs. Some teams apparently can't be beaten. What a waste of $5!"", 'Where to begin: 1. The AI is too cheap. Constantly getting perfect hits after player team scores. Insulting rubberband AI 2. It is unfair when I make an obviously clear tag out on a play, but the AI is always called safe. 3. Touch controls do not respond, especially when trying to throw to a specific base. Make larger base icons to make it easier to throw.  FIX THIS NOW!']"

Flick Home Run! baseball game,com.infinitypocket.flickhomerun,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.infinitypocket.flickhomerun&hl=en&gl=us,"Flick your finger and make a homerun. 
You can experience a real baseball batting through the physical pendulum. 

This is a game in which you can experience various throws based on the pendulum. The ball will fly further if you can hit the ball directly with the quick flick. Experience a “real-life like” batting simulation. 


# Easy Control--------------------------- 
You only use flick to control the batting for this game. The more accurate you flick your finger to hit the ball; it is more likely that you will be a home-run hitter. 
The rule is simple. Flick your finger with the same feeling in which you would swing a bat in real life. Think of your finger as a bat, and flick it with speed and accuracy. That’s all. 

# Movement of the ball------------------ 
Various kinds of throws are materialized into “real-life like” feelings. Different pitches pull out different various kinds of movements. Thus, the batter may miss the timing and would be hard to hit. 

# 10 GAME mode------------------------ 
You can enjoy this game through 5 kinds of mode. 
Minor & Major Mode- Hit as many home-runs as you can; as far as you can. 
Multiplayer Mode- You can compete with other players via Game Center. 
Moon-Star Mode- Try for a record with the given 9 balls. 
Training Mode- You can practice with different kinds of pitches. 
*Bunt mode ( need minor 15step): Drop the ball on the target of the floor correctly. 
*Total mode ( need bunt 10000 point ) : You’ll meet many different types of the balls from the beginning of the game. 
*Faster & faster ( need total 25000 point ) : Head-to-head with only fastballs. 
*Jiant mode ( need F&F 10000 point ) : Match with a Giant pitcher 
*Cutter mode ( need Jiant 12000 point ) : Match with cutterballs which can cut the baseball bat. 

# add 28 Achievement Bonus-------------- 
1 Achievement = 1 level up bonus!!! 

# Level Up System----------------------- 
You can choose and upgrade 1 of 3 skills every time the exp becomes full.- 
Power: You can increase the power of the bat 
Accuracy: You can increase the accuracy of the batting 
Batting Eye: You can know ahead of the next ball’s pattern 

# Home-Run Tip!--------------------------- 
1.Make a full swing with a fast batting-speed! 
2.Hit the ball followed from the various thrown pattern with an accurate swing! 
3.Let’s keep an eye on the ball until the end and predict the change of the pattern! 
4.Let’s be confident and make a full swing! 

# FAQ ------------------------------------- 
Q : How does STEP UP SYSTEM? 
A : STEP UP = More balls 
ex) Minor 1 step = 3 balls 
Minor 2 step = 6 balls

Also sometimes when your in the touchdown sometimes it didn't count. ALSO GAINING YARDS. OTHERWISE it's a very good game."", ""It sucks because the controls are dodo and if you go for a long pass you don't even throw the ball far."", 'I really like this game, it is a lot of fun, but it has gotten way to easy. I play on pro mode and still absolutely destroy any opponent. Thank you!', 'Football is one of the best games and their teams are so good and tackling is big.', 'Dont know why people are giving one stars. Very addicting game! Fun game! And a time killer! But i think you guys should do status on the players and everything. Like individual status. Keep track of attempts to completion. Everything thebwhol 9 yards!! Definitely something to think about! If you guys do that itd be PERFECT!!!']"

Thanks for playing!","['Cool game... It seems to have glitches... several times, I have been kicked out by the server and when I log back in, i was told that I had forfeited the game I was playing. It does get pretty annoying especially since it affects my stats and my play credits. Controls are ok. Several times the AI took control of my running back and went a different route than I was going. When passing the ball to a receiver, my selection is not always chosen and is thrown to someone else.', ""Game is another money grab from EA. $30 to play event seasons and thats each. So you can't get a good team by working hard. This should seriously be illegal. Graphics are bad and controls are bad. They basically put their worst team on the game development and expect people to spend 4× the cost of the console version just to play different modes. Criminal organization. Hopefully you asshats go bankrupt."", ""So far so good, I have been playing since Madden 18. This game has always been one of my favorites. I started playing Madden 20 in September and it has been a good Madden mobile game. But if you don't have a good signal, it is very annoying. You start playing then it logs you out if you have low or no signal. Overall this game is very great and very well-made. I would recommend this game to anybody who is intrigued in the NFL. P.S. EA if your listening please make a new Rob Gronkowski card soon."", 'Love the game. Buying and selling players, upgrading them, and building a stunning roster. I wish the season mode games were a little harder. It would also be kind of cool if you could make direct player or item trades with league team mates. And lastly, it seems impossible to get Madden cash without paying real money for it. Otherwise great game. Recommend to all.', 'This game is very fun if you like football and know some of the players. The special events they have in madden are fun to work at. The rewards are usually pretty good. The seasons mode is a lot better than last year with the addition of trades. Sometimes they make it too hard to get a player, but overall a great game', 'at the moment I give this game is 2 star. Startibg very first about tthe overalls, I have a 84 overall in DEF and its terrible. Most of my players are ""trained"" highly but when I vs an 73 overall DEF there intercepting my balls left and right? And my players are mostly open but the 73 DEF does a ""boost"" and ints? Trust me it\'s not my OFF either, I have a 85 overall in OFF. Madden used to be a banger back in 2017, but now it\'s once again ..a 2 star :///', ""Decent game. Need a filter for minimum power you would for players. Sometimes an 85 overall player has 10 power I have to look 5 minutes to get the same 85 overall player with 50 power (sometimes he'llbe cheaper to. Power makes a biggggg difference in this game. FIX YOUR DAMN GLITCH!!!! THE DE IS BEATING MY 97 OVERALL OT ON EVERY DAMN PLAY..... 97 OVERALL NOT 80..... I FLIP THE PLAY AND THE SAME THING HAPPENS. FIX IT"", ""Honestly I love this game. It's the best game I ever played. But the only reason I am only giving 4 stars is because the game keeps a black screen every time I open it. I have tolerated this behavior many times, but I ignored it just because the game is so good. But if madden reads my review, I hope that they will fix this problem soon. No pressure Madden, but if you fix this, madden will be the best game ever."", ""Sets dissapear without warning. Just upgraded ultimate legends tier and today there is no way to play for items despite 27weeks showing left on timer. This game rips rug out from under you just as you're making progress and gives a whole new set to work for. Deep pockets blowing mad cash is about the only way. Don't bother unless just really bored."", ""I really love the game, but it's become boring because the Career Tributes on madden today make the game the most fun, now that's the only reason I play. Please put more career tributes. Also, you should give rewards for everyday that you log on. Finally, you should make it easier to upgrade your team as you get better, because without madden can, it's almost impossible to get better. And you should make madden cash buyable with gems, or a lot of coins."", 'Really good addicting game but you need to fix those trash controls. Nevermind, how can a hard team in seasons make a 17-0 comeback in 3rd quarter when I have playmaker and full legend and elite squad. The reality of this game is outrageously unbelievable. How can a 83 ovr. catch the ball over TWO, no, THREE 90 ovr. players!', 'Awesome game but a little hard to understand instructions could be a lot better! 8 think I understand most of the game now starting to get some big high number players now just in time for 2021 to come out just to lose all my hard work and hours of work they should let you take your 2020 players to 2021 that would be cool at least like 10 players or something like that!', ""Can be a fun game easy to level up your team. But just like on the consoles the multiplayer you have to do to level up your couch and league play is horrible. Soon as you snap the ball you get sacked or the QBs throw the ball away. The one that happens all the time is the corners will hold the receivers on the line for the most of the play. Or your receiver's get caught on them when running down the field. Then you play an 80 over team and they act like their a 100 overall and ur team bad"", ""Everything keeps freezing at 99%. I've uninstalled and reinstalled. Cleared history and cookies. When it freezes on league play and overdrive matches it automatically forfeits me every time and in season mode the computer just takes over games when you're playing on defense. No matter what you do they are going to score. Super unrealistic."", ""Was a fun game, but as soon as I started getting somewhere in the game, it crashed every single time I tried to play anything. I have uninstalled, completely wiped the data from my phone and it doesn't matter. They obviously don't care about the players and it's never worth it to install games like this. Would be a 3 star game if I could, you know, actually play it."", ""Where to begin. Teams significantly worse than mine (75OVR vs 91OVR) somehoe have the ability to make interceptions on plays which are inhuman. Hail Mary events in overdrive are impossible. Every second League vs League event I am unable to take part in. My phone locks itself every 2 minutes when playing the game, making online impossible. But the most annoying thing is that the help email doesn't work and I know this has and will fall on deaf ears"", ""I've been playing madden since I was younger and when I saw it in my play store I had to get it . 4 years of playing Madden with my cellphone and this game never let's you down , the mobile version gets better and better every year. Thank you so much for the hard work it definitely pays off."", 'I just got the game a couple of weeks ago and i got to play one season.. I changed the team and then i started a season and whenever the loading percentage went to 100% the app would close... I cancelled the season and tried over and over again.. It also did this with any challenge i tried to do.. I uninstalled and reinstalled many times.. I changed the team back to what i previously had and tried it and it still didnt work... Reeeeee', 'Everytime I play the arena mode, the app shuts itself down and when I reopen the app, it says I forfeited the game. Every. Single. Time!! Then with the h2h mode, I won 23-15 and it also said that i forfeited the game. I played for a week to see if it would get better and aame results. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS GAME', 'In game buys way too expensive. You can spend $75 to $100 just to buy 1 player to upgrade your team. Bad thing is most of these buys can loose value as they release higher ovr players during the season. So you can see you can easily have spend hundreds even thousands of dollars trying to keep your team competitive. Cheaper to buy the newest playstation and a dozen games at $40 to $60 a pop. EA needs to lower their prices to level the playing field. Not everyone has that kind of cash to waist.', 'DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS GAME. It is pay to play....every new promo they bring out a new player they nerf the old ""best player""...You also play A LOT of bots....they also nerf your team so lower rated teams can win. Game play is horrendous as well...many many complaints about controls not working. Just check Twitter for validity of this review.', ""This game use to be great like two months ago,now it's just bad. Not only going against a team in the arena that has 1,300 team power and you having 850,But when you tap the button to throw the ball it won't even throw at times. And for Overdrive they sometimes give the opponent's extra points for no reason or work that they didnt even do at times! Fix this game please!"", ""Overdrive players are cheating. Tolerated it long enough until i was ahead by 500pts plus. Then at 0:01 left, the score goes from 798 (me) 276 (them) to 798 (me) and 904 (them). Until you fix your hacker issue (some plays, i am tackled right at the snap. Thus proving that they can see what i am picking. That software does exist btw), I'm done."", ""Really fun but there are a couple issues. 1) While playing in seasons, after a while the arms will glitch all over the place and it messed up my QB's throws and i lost that game. 2) When playing seasons there should be a difficulty in-between medium and hard because in medium i won every game but in hard i lost every game. Other than this its a fun game and cant wait to keep playing Thanks!"", ""It's a lil slow but I love football so much it doesn't matter. It's a great game for football fans although every game can't be perfect. Especially when they have a console version that brings in real money you can't expect them to update or fix this as much"", 'Fun time killer, but dont take it serious. You can build an ultimate team and see 98 ovr players fumble and drop open passes in overdrive events. Stick with madden today events, and season mode and you will be ok. Dont waste money on this game because your team will look like a pro bowl team one game and a division 3 high school team the next.', 'I cant even play the game because it keeps shutting me out. I try to play an event and then the app stops and goes to my home screen. This used to be a great game, there werent any problems before. I would give it 5 starts if it was the way it was before', ""this game has connection timeouts every 2 minutes I've played this game for like year's and this is the worst year outta all if them im uninstalling and when i play competitive i am winning by lots of points it crashes and i login and it automatically forfeits and it makes m3 lose PS, The game has got alot better since, i took a 4 months break then started playing again."", ""It's a fun game. I always loved madden mobile, but this one I had a difficult time to play. You have little stamina, and the players you play against are sometimes 4-15 overall above you!!! Sometimes when you press on a player, the QB throws it to someone else! Also, the game disconnects frequently even when I'm sitting next to the wifi router."", ""The game was fun at first but once you get further in it gets awful. You can have running backs with 90+ speed and get chased down by lineman. Players can tackle you from 15 yards away. Not to mention the customer service is horrendous. Had a couple problems and both times I emailed them they did absolutely nothing. Didn't get rewards from an event and after asking me the same questions 5 times they basically told me too bad. I guess that's what you get when you outsource your customer service."", 'This app usually works extremely smoothly. However recently I am not receiving rewards for completing Diamond Blitz events. Spending 80 stamina, not receiving a reward, and the attempt still registering, its causing stamina waste. Will definitely increase my rating after this issue is addressed.', 'A great game, but since EA Help stopped email support in favor of phone support I am unable to get help because each time I initiate a case, EA Help sends me an email with two links to initiate a phone support call and both links lead to a blank case information page. Until this very frustrating issue is fixed my rating will stay low. I hope EA Help will reinitiate email help ASAP because I am angry at spending real money and in-game currency on content I then do not receive (aka rip-off).', ""Yay I lost my league I was in hall of fame and it kicked me out of the game so I lost it's so annoying this game sucks. And I hate how you don't get to keep your jerseys after every big update and that's another reason why I hate this game. And EA needs to lower the prices down not a lot of people have spare cash like that"", ""Anybody who gave this game a good rating is either RICH or have played the game only a few times. I have played this game for 4 years in a row. Very dedicated 3 of 4 years. It's a HUGE cash grab now. Even more than before. Go figure it's EA. You have to pay for everything, EVERYTHING! Building your team up does nothing I promise. That 92 overall that costs $100, yes $100 for a fake mobile game card, does absolutely nothing to the performance of your team. FU EA. Scum."", ""Great gameplay and fun game modes but lacks a exhibition mode so after a while the ultimate team gets boring and the stamina gets low to quickly. Also the season mode is fun but I wish I could perpose trades. This still feels like a mut mobile, they are getting closer to a real Madden mobile with season mode but aren't there yet this game gets boring and when microtransactions are required for special seasons or special events there is something wrong - Madden NFL Mobile 20"", ""I play this game and really enjoy playing it. But the new update is what I'm assuming is the problem seeing as how the game played fine before the update but after when I go to play it doesn't load the players. Everything else is fine. I can snap the ball throw the ball run the ball what jat ever i want. But I CAN'T SEE ANY PLAYERS !!!! PLEASE FIX THIS BUG!!!......... I am pleased to say that the bugs have been fixed and the game is awesome. The only problem is the fact of so many new updates."", ""Overall solid play. Only thing I don't like is in head 2 head it'll forfeit without you doing it. Also, it take to long to get the top notch players without spending money. Just the same players over and over in the packs. What's up with these updates every other week? Geesh. Why can't I update this game. Everytime it's time for an update, I always gotta do it over 10 times. What's up with all these updates?"", 'I would say 3.5 stars. Compared with prior seasons, it\'s much less likely that items being auctioned sell. Even items placed well under ""market value"" come back unsold at varying tiers of cards. The result is a giant stockpile of cards as you improve that should be helpful but essentially have very little value. On the positive side, there are so many different ways to play for hours on end that are all pretty interesting.', 'The game is fun, but it needs a little more work to be most popular again. Like adding a practice mode so the player can understand all the moves by learning himself/herself. Controller support needs to be fixed a bit. I sully understand that it was rushed and there is still some updates to it, but the slit delay in movement needs to be fixed if you want to have further more knowledge on what to fix for controller support. Please accept this as a few requests to help the game progress further.', ""My experience madden is really fun now that i'm getting the hang of things and I must say that the designers did a great job with this one because im beginning to like this alot... There is some small things but im sure its because of the phone im using,.. Play style mechanics is overall beautifull for me allmost like im really there.. Uhm.. The graphics mechanics is also superb for an android game... Yes the controls could use a little twitching i think thats all... Well overall your awesome!!""]"

It is really frusterating, especially if it is a close game and/or you already have a low amount of money. Other than this, and the lack of feminine hair styles, the game is a great game and would be 5 stars from me.', ""The game itself is fun. Lots of features, and I like how it's not fully pay to play or fully pay to win. The problem is the loading screen is horrendously slow and doesn't work half of the time. Also, the game has some performance issues on a OnePlus 6 at times (mainly a few minutes after the phone boots and during calls), which is also a bummer."", 'My experience on this game is really good because I have learnt new tactics which will allow me to use in a real match at school. My brother and I loves this because he only like doing the dunks and the crazy hoops. I also like them but I also like Attack and Defence as well as just Throwing the basketball into the net and I won lots of money from that and there is a game that you have to complete in order to earn money and gold coins. This is really fun game. I hope you enjoy as well.#GOODLUCK', 'This game has good gameplay mechanics, but that\'s about the only good thing. The ""main currency""(cash) is the currency that\'s used to ""bet"" on games that you play. There is literally nothing in the store that costs cash. It may be used to upgrade your balls, but I never enough ball cards to upgrade one. This is a month+ playing. Your character\'s clothes are guaranteed to not match. I finally unlocked a matching suit and it looks like communist China. Everything want is hidden inside premium bags', ""Should be a great game but I'm getting frustrated. As soon as you build up enough money and have a game on the career mode the servers can't seem to handle it and the lag makes it impossible to play well. Same with the super cup, opposition players seem to be everywhere you are and I've had shots blocked on many occasions when the player isn't standing in front of mine, and shots blocked when it looks like they have got past there attempted block."", 'This game has serious issues that need resolving Matched opponents are frequently of a much higher level. Disappointing as this issue stops any real progression in the game. One on one games - when taking a shot, the ball is well past the opponent, and all of a sudden it is a blocked shot. Another issue is when playing a Shooting Race my timer will run out, whilst the opponent will be able to take their shot. Frustrating as there is potential for this to be a superb game. One star.', ""Good Game . Really enjoyable. The only thing with this Game is just about money. U don't really need to know how to play or be at a higher level to be a winner, as soon as you buy skills the game won't allow you to win . He will have time to come back at u, or the ball won't go in. I guess it's because the opponent pay more money so they make him win. Money money money. Beside that it could have been a great game without the cheating :) Enjoy."", ""Game has lot of bugs, vip users are not shooting correctly to the basket but they are getting points, and same as for block they even not blocking but it's says blocked, and for extra points - i am shooting first and it's basketed but the opponent shoots after me and basket even he is getting the full points, correct the bugs and rest of the game is good, i am going to uninstall now for these things."", ""It was cool at first , the free bags is what made me keep playing every day getting new clothes was my favorite part of this game , but now I'm at level 20 I have a full dunk king outfit , but every single bag I've gotten after has duplicate items inside so for like the last maybe 50 bags I haven't gotten any new clothing , not to mention the cash pretty much means nothing but for bets or card upgrades , so now I'm might uninstall and find something else I feel like Ive hit a wall with this one"", 'One thing i do not like.. when you score it will clearly be all net , the developers does not catch that every time , the time will run out.. and the opponent will still be able to score and shoot.

But I'm not happy that I had atleast 21 gold bars saved up lastnight , and for some reason today it only says 4 gold bars. I know I didn't use them.

This game turns semi pros mad. MY balls were all upgraded to slide in or bang but there is no way of penetrating the pot when you face 3x more experienced scorers.

I would have scored way better using my own balls.', 'The game is fun but it sometimes seems rigged. First when I go to shoot the ball it will be right at the basket but then it will somehow go back to when I shoot it and say it was blocked.

Other than that add a reason to actually have money because it serves no purpose."", ""I like the game alot but I dont think on the Attack-Deffender they should make you go against people that has a higher rank than you and One the Shooting Race I think the same and I also think they should not let you or the other opponent go against someone with a lower rank I think that's not fair ovisaly the person with the higher rank is gonna win and I think they should have a tutorial to show you all the tricks. Because ovisaly the one that knows the tricks is gonna win."", 'I think there are some cheating going on in this game.
