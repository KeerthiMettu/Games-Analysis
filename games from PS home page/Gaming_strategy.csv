And its so obvious. You vould be winning over and over but then you chose to take the challenge of winning two battles in a row and all of a sudden it goes win lose win lose over and over. I think this seriously needs fixing. Or atleast make it less obvious. I mean for the bots theres like 4 variations of base layouts. It gets kinda dull when ur always attacking the same layout.', 'The game is so terrific and amazing I play this game every day to do a battle or an upgrade on my defensives. But, the upgrades are too expensive and take for ever to finish. For example: the skeleton trap takes 6 hours to just put one more skeleton troop inside? Really? Wow must be difficult to just ask a witch to give them a skeleton. Plz make stuff cheaper and plz make the upgrade time go down. Thank you', ""Waste of time! Clan games is programmed to make you spend more time completing quests! When doing loot elixir quest, the matched bases have small elixir loot. When doing versus that require victories, the bases that matches are all maxed, or higher level compared to during normal matching. The harder you try the more you fail in this game! It's not fun losing constantly and this game is very unfair! Better uninstall like me or you'll just regret later!"", ""Played this game back in 2014. Got to th7 then quit. Came back last month and am very impressed with the updates and changes. Have just gone to th7 from maxed out 6. Finding clan games and wars fun too. 'Battle pass' concept is cool however gold pass should be earnable ingame or something to allow people who dont p2w an equal chance. Game is fun and enjoyable!!"", ""Game updates are decreasing the power of troops , creating more time in the clouds and reducing the abilities to train troops quickly. Additionally the throphy value of bases are to random with minimal valuation of bases and losing a battle isn't exactly directly valued evenly with winning a battle. Players lose interest when advancing in the game requires extended time to upgrade any thing. There are no practice or tutorials for town hall 13. It is discouraging to constantly need to buy books"", 'Clash of Clans has been my favorite app since I got my first mobile device. I have been playing for 6 years now and love almost every aspect of this game. The timers for building are always a nuisance but the trade off of no advertising, constant updates, and a great community simply make it all worth it.', ""Preferably one of the best free to play game I've played. It doesn't have ANY ads, can max out your base without spending a single money. I just love this game. The most thing I've love in this game is when your troop (armor, sword) change when you level them up, very satisfying to see them change their theme after 2 levels.

But this time I returned to find global had been removed, it's very disappointing to see a staple section of the game removed. It just doesn't feel the same and it's not going to be fun to recruit or to wait for troops to finish, and the new recruit feature to fill the void of global doesn't work. So I write this review in hopes that supercell will have a change of heart"", ""Garbage game. I'm a completely free to play player so the people at supercell constantly tried to screw me over. When I got to titan league, it took an average of 3 minutes to find a match, which had absolutely no loot and even less trophies. Then everyone raids me for over 20 trophies. If this game actually respected free to play players, it would be a lot better. But just like all other supercell games, they just want your money."", 'Game was fun, now it seems maybe dead.

I started playing in 2011 just as the game came out when i was in 7th grade at the time, and I can genuinely say I played it every single one of those years.

But it's so time consuming you have to wait for almost everything unless you want to buy gems. And it does entice you buy and spend gems a lot. But none the less it's fun to play."", ""Here in the game, initially the game play is good but after town hall 7 we have to wait till 7 to 8 days to upgrade similarly it is very difficult to store amount in our Treasury as village gets attacked. Now the only suggestion I may give is reduce the time and cost of upgrades. Or else it gets boring to waith for 14 days or 10 days or either increase the amount of production of gold, elixir and dark elixir (specially) to ensure that game doesn't end up being boring."", ""I can't play it on wifi. I'll have internet connection but it always says that it has connectivity problems. I can onlt play ot on my data but I don't have much data and I don't want to be constantly using it for this. Please fix so I can play it with WiFi again."", ""Very good game. Although when I attack if I get kicked out of the game I lose all progress on the attack and can't do anything about it.

The graphics are very good .', ""i don't like the new update, i can't do screen recording, its going home by itself, its suddenly stopped as in pause for a moment until i missed the time where i should deploy the troops or the spell that's why i sometimes loss the atck and I'm afraid to attack in war because of that.. 🙁 i love it BEFORE, not the current one 💖 also the global, its so boring when no one's online in my clan, i cant talk to anyone unlike before, its fun to talk to stranger.. also, i suggest to have private msgs"", ""Connection Lost You have lost connection to the server. Check you internet connection and try again. I have high speed internet, even 300 megabyte per sec. wifi. So how in the hell is this possible, i have already updated it and nothing.

I used to play till about 4 years ago then i uninstalled the app but only after saving it on google play games as I was given a notification to register on google play games or the game progress would be lost and guess what a few days back I installed it again and opened with play games and from a maxed out base of townhall level 8, i was reverted back to townhall level 4! Can you imagine??? All my progress lost!', ""Awesome game that does take time but is very worth it watching your base evolve to get better. They are still having new town halls come out in updates so you can keep playing. Builder base is super fun because it's a completely different game with new troops and different strategies. Would highly recommend for anyone. Deffently my favorite mobile game."", 'This game used to be amazing until they took global chat away. It was the easiest way to recruit new players and you could play for hours just chatting. Now you have to find 3red party websites and apps and its rediculous because you one spec in a million on one website and your looked over pretty easily. Just give us back global already.', 'The greatest game i have ever played. It is supper fun and challenging. The game makes you think and strategies to attack and defend against other players. I recomend this game to all ages that want to have a fun and strategies.', 'My experience was good about this game.I like it format of battle with others and also making friend(internationally)in a game.it is a long journey in game from th1 to 13 and I wish to complete it.i experience many things in this game and my experience was good', 'I have play this game many time in 2017-2018 when I saw it there was a new update then I installed it then it was amazing so now also I am playing practice mode levels are not unlocking do something about it .make new updates so more people will join and we also want more upgrade.I have a idea for you make more cities in which we can go in our ships . well done I like your game very much and keep it up.', 'Pretty good game. I would love to see a feature where instead of having just one builder on 1 thing. So of there were 2 builders, it would be half the time, 3 a third of the time, 4 a fourth of the time. At the cost of not being able to upgrade as many things at a time.', ""Best game honestly the wonderful game is just hard to beat I mean you can you know join clans other people and really just do you know have fun and that's the most important part in a game that's why I love it so much and upgrades are alike you upgrade go so far like it just amazing game I've noticed likes about it and you get upgrades in in game"", 'One of the best games to ever be made. I love the gameplay and sounds of everything in game and I love how you dont have to pay for gems you can get them by clearing obstacles and the gem mine in the builder hall base', 'Versus battles are where players are treated unequally, a newly upgraded Builder base to level 6 with all defenses and troops in the previous level, versus a level 8 Builder base with fully upgraded troops and defenses (including Super P.E.K.K.A, giant cannon and mega tesla). That makes my result gain no stars, meanwhile the opponent get 100 percent of destruction!', ""It is a lovely game, the gameplay is totally awesome. But it depends too much on the network. I can't even check my profile in i have a poor network. Am not saying that it should be offline because it can't. Am just saying part of the game should be offline. Like games like Pes20.""]"

There used to be no ads before, but now it just appears everywhere, out of nowhere! 5 stars to 2, and deleting the game. :(', 'Used to be better before the ads. Now ads pop up between games and kill the mood. The game used to have a clean and premium feel to it, uncorrupted by big ads.

Then when you reach the Challenger arenas, players that are 3 levels higher then you start matching with you. It's ridiculously annoying when your just trying to play and you go up against higher level opponents. It's literally impossible to beat them. The game is literally pay to win. I've given this game many chances but the matchmaking always ruins it."", 'So while I love this game and the game mechanics behind it, it is the most out of balance game. Not in the units, but in the matchmaking. The game pairs you up with people of similar trophies, but will decide when you win and when you lose. If you are too high of trophies for your level, it will pair you against decks that are meant to counter you. If you lose too many times, it will pair you against decks that you counter. There is no strategy in the end, just divine intervention from the devs.', ""I think it benefits players who spend a lot of money on the game to much. For the people that are free to play it's not so great. I heard it's supposed to be random battles, but when you start to win several you start getting matches against hard counters. Usually several in a row. And people with better cards. So it looks like there just trying to get you to spend money for upgrades. About to delete the game."", ""I don't understand who did the match making system but I don't think they understand the concept of balance. When you go into a match and your cards are out leveled by over 3 levels and your tower is under it makes it nearly impossible to even come close to winning. They tend to also favor putting you in those kinds of matchups after you win one or two games."", ""I mean I think the battle pass is a load of rubbish but apart from that it's still an amazing game and I enjoy it. I think it has gotten a bit too easy now though because it is really easy to get to the legendary arena and higher, back then it was nearly impossible to get to hog mountain or the other arenas that used to be the best. Oh and legendaries are really easy to get too. Apart from that, it's a good game."", ""WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!!!This game use to be fun until supercell got greedy. There's no strategy anymore... the game will be over before it starts based on your card selection and you can't see your opponants. It's just 3 minute intermus of getting your face beat in because you don't have cards to counter I suggest anyone thinking of downloading to look at all the recent low ratings!!!!!!"", ""The game is a fun and enjoyable game and although it seems easy to play you require a lot of skills. However it is hard to level up in this game which makes it frustrating when you face people of high levels. Supercell doesn't fix the level issue because this doesn't apply to the pros who are all already level 13. I HOPE Supercell can make it easier to level up to make this a game more fun and enjoyable and not just cashing on gems and stuff to try to level up."", ""I really wanted to like this game. I love the concept of it. But the matchmaking is horrible. I play against level 12 when I'm level 6... How does that even make sense? Also, the way this game is designed I'd that if you win 2 games in a row, then you lose 2 games in a row. It takes SOO long to rank up, this is more of a grind game. It's also a pay to win game, you can win just by paying. It's so stupid and the game is SO bad. Like, hackers in this game is too intense. Every 10th game is hacker."", ""App is great but ever since last night, it won't open. I tried getting help through sending feedback but haven't heard anything and got an automated response through email telling me to go into the game & ask for help from there but I can't do that since I can't even get in 😩 hopefully I get some help because I'm scared I'll lose all progress if I uninstall & reinstall"", 'Base game is entertaining. The better you get at the game though the more you realize the faults of it. Forced slow down with chest openings creates a need to purchase ways to open chests. Purchase prices are incredibly difficult to stomach. There is no player report button so the higher level players will cheat approximately 60% of the time. Clearly a lack of concern from the developers', ""I have played this game for 3 years (which they have failed to recognize) and I hate it. The only reason I still play is my friends. The pairing system is aweful. Cheats are also allowed. It's a pay to win game. I'd you pay for gems, you'll be better. No matter what. I'm a strategist, and I won most battles. But when I come up against a level 10 king level that has star level cards that game kill any of my troops with 3 shots, there's nothing to do. Please fix it. I know you won't see it."", 'The game as a whole is ok, but am now NOT impressed with their service. I tried to purchase a 19.99 deal they were offering, never recieved. I was told to wait and check back if it doesnt appear. I did exactly that, and was told they can do nothing for me. I have the screen shots as proof and would post them but google play doesnt seem to allow that.', ""It is a good strategy game but it has some flaws. Good part is that it has awesome graphics and easy to use. Bad part is that at some point, you get to battle against players who use money to get cards especially legendary ones ... and it really annoys me. It isn't fair. If you use real money to buy cards or chests then you should only get to battle those who have done the same. Seriously .....I get really annoyed. The matchmaking is really really bad. I would give a 2 star off 5 for it."", ""It's a good game for strategic players. But I it should also have a report option for the players who leave the 2v2 battles in between the match or even after starting a match. I really hate when such players enter as my partner in random options. So the developers should think about it and come to a decision for this problem. The worst thing about the game is the tie breaker. I don't like that."", ""It's a nice game if you like live action strategy. Stack your deck and use it wisely. You get a lot of noobs when you first start playing but as you level up and collect trophies things get more interesting as you run into more evenly matched players. The only drawback is the wait time to open chests is a little long. Quick, fun, and great for playing on those short breaks at work or at home."", ""This is a great game with an easy concept. That only problem with it is the same problem they have with every other supercell game. The matchmaking. They love to put you up against people that are so high level that anything you use can and will get one tapped. Other than that not too bad. Some op cards like the Pekka and mega night will never be fixed. I've come to terms with that😥"", ""from a player who played for 3 years 1. the inevitable problem with the so called free to play games like this one is that sooner or later you find yourself playing against either suckers that are several levels higher than you ( because they paid more) or noobs that you crush easily. there's rarely a good game win or lose. there's no satisfaction. 2. matching mechanism is especially bad for this one. 3. balance changes are a joke. one only needs to check their twitter account for history."", ""It's great that this game listens to the players at the highest level and makes balance changes based on that, but the normal players just trying to get to arena 13 or whatever are completely ignored. Players have been asking for nerfs to cards like wizard and mega knight for a while but they just get ignored and end up playing against them almost every game. While they aren't good at e sport level, the majority of the playerbase isn't e sport level and they suck to play against constantly."", ""It's a great game that just keeps on giving. I've been playing for over 4 years and it's still one of the only games I haven't deleted. Not only are you able to talk, play, and share with friends but you always having something new coming out like a new character card, new challenges, new bounces, and even more like the new pass royal that let's the hard core players get more for only $5!!"", ""Absolutely horrendous. Pay to win trash. What a giant turd this game has become. So much non sense going on. I need to spend 20 minutes just opening chests and watching slow animations while they try to sell me a fake with fake cards for $99. Are you kidding me?! I wouldn't pay a dime towards this awful game and you shouldn't either. Pay to win. Pay to win. Supercell has ruined games with a hard push to force kids to spend big money just to compete. Shame shame."", ""Note to retard developers: Although you may THINK you are punishing players for losing their connection while in a battle by not allowing them to team up for a time without letting them know that anymore because you know as well as we do that it isn't fair.... But it won't stop players (wink wink) that KNOW (statistically) when they are going to lose to just stop playing. How dumb can you guys get?"", ""Full of pay-to-win people, not fun at all. You don't need much skill to play this game, just pay them money. They don't support free-to-play people and their 2v2 algorithm is off balance. I had to fight a level 11 at level 6 multiple times. I don't recommend this unless you want to waste time. Disclaimer: This game will make you mad. I would rate 0 stars if I could"", ""To the Developers: my cards are at max level and now use stars. But i only get half the stars awarded to me. Example: When I open a chest it tells me I have a number of stars 155 and when it goes to tally up the Stars after getting out of the chest screen it's always Tally's up as much less 61. What gives? I'd like the rest of my stars so that I can give you the rest of your stars. I keep getting short changed on stars. I'm still wait for developers to respond! *****"", 'If you enjoy constantly being mismatched against opponents who have higher level cards and towers than yourself then this is the game for you. Supercell keeps doing ""balance changes"" (read random card changes) but don\'t address the horrible matchmaking algorithm, the entire way that they match you against opponents is based solely on your trophy count so you get punished quickly for having success and if you want to play for free forget about it unless you have years to dedicate to a mobile game', ""The game is absolute garbage. Based entirely on money spent and luck of the draw for your deck. The matchmaking is incredibly flawed. You'll be absolutely screwed of your WiFi is bad. The deploy time for the card can increase fivefold if your game loads slowly. The game clearly registers the play, but it won't implement it, meanwhile, your opponent gets a free run at your towers."", ""Gameplay is fun and requires having a good strategy. That is all that is good with it. The matchmaking is trash, does not matter how good your strategy is if you get paired with opponents who are at least 2 levels higher than you in both long tower level and card level. It's getting ridiculous what's it is next to impossible to advance in trophies. I get the pass but this matchmaking I think it's just the game developers trying to get you to spend tons on money on gems so you can buy upgrades."", ""Could be a great game if it weren't for the serious Pay to win issues and fundamentally flawed matchmaking. I am routinely matched up against max level players (I'm level 11) with mostly or entirely maxed out units. Essentially, at least one of three things is true: 1) Matchmaking is rigged to discourage consecutive games 2) I'm so unbelievably good at the game it's only fair to match me up against impossible opponents 3) If they don't take card & player lvl into account, its simply bad design"", ""Addictive game, but aparent speed hacks. If you don't have the speed hacks don't waste your money trying to level your heros the speed hacks are faster and more powerful. How the people that made this game don't know about it is silly but it's what it is. Great game though even better if everyone was on the same playing field. Thumbs up"", ""I've played this game since launch day and it is still a very unique and fun game. I only have one major problem and that's the Mega Knight. The pay-to-win players use this card nonstop and it completely destroys everything and honestly is ruining matches that could be competitive. I'd say fix Ram Rider as well, but atleast you can get away without it completely destroying your towers. Simple balances would make this game as close to perfect as it could be."", ""This game has become quite unfun. Almost 80% of the games I play, I get matched up with players with higher levels. And I'm constantly going against the same overpowered cards. Example: I always get matched up with players who use Mega Knight and Magic Archers. Both of these cards are super OP and definitely need a nerf. It's really frustrating to play a game that's being structured to aid those who pay. Overall an unbalanced pay-to-win game that I would NOT recommend new players to download."", ""This is a amazing game. The patience you need in the game is amazing. The only reason I don't give it a 5 star is because you need pass royal to do alot of nice things. I get to get the best treatment you need money thing but some people don't really have money to pay for it. I just wish they gave commoners a better game experience. Also trading is annoying because you always need to have a trading token to trade and it's hard to get those. But over all an amazing game and highly recommend it."", ""Don't bother paying or playing. Played for 4+ years and can't take how rigged the game is. Nobody will admit, but when they want you to lose a game, you'll face some impossible to beat combination and they'll never make a mistake. Basically playing vs an AI opponent. They do this so they can limit the free rewards you earn by winning, and therefore require you to pay for cash rewards to progress your account."", ""I actually stopped playing for a while and I've just returned, just to discover that it has become way, way worse. Every single card that they have added is worse than the other, I get put against players who are times two from my skill level, and this is just the most sad thing I have ever seen. From the best mobile game this app has turned into a pile of trash, and I'm really sad to see this happen. I hope they can fix this, but in order for that to happen they need to remove every new update"", 'Good app but not for free to play gamers like myself. It\'s been over 2 years since I\'ve started playing this game but gems and coins are a major limiting factor to my progress. *Edit* Over the past few years I\'ve seen great improvements in terms of how f2p players are treated and I greatly appreciate it. As for the gameplay, however, realistically there hasn\'t been much added that screams ""what a huge overhaul"" Improving my rating from 3 to 4 I love this game and am looking forward for newstuf', 'I have been playing this game for a long time, and I just have to say that it doesnt get boring. Well done Supercell for managing to create such an amazing game! Personally, you guys should include some sort of water character. There is just no water in it. Overall, though it is really fun. Great work.', 'Not paying for another month of premium till you start changing things for the better. No innovation in game modes, same old ""this spawns on either side"". Most challenges are either a roll of the dice or to easy. No new ideas. More chest slots? Where is a 2v2 ladder? How about a pve mode versus waves of enemies? How about a spell card that shields an area from spell damage for a time, so there is an actual counter to spells?', ""The tiebreaker feature sucks, forcibly moving the towers' health in order to create an outcome isn't the way to create fair game play. The matchmaking for 1v1 is trash. I have won a fair bit of level 12's when I was level 9, but I'm seeing people who pay to play and max out their cards at level 13 and absolutely destroy other players. It's not fun to play. This game is becoming a pay to play ghst forces you to stay at the same level and pay $5 a month to play. Not worth it. May uninstall."", ""It's not Clash of Clans, that's for sure. It was fun, but a little too easy. Plus, if I'm paying for the Gold Pass in one game I don't want to pay for it in another. Without the Gold Pass, it gets boring. 3 out of 5 stars because it's a good game, just seems like a simplified version of CoC."", ""The gameplay is good, however the matchmaking is so shameless. Playing vs players at the higher ranks is always against people with higher level cards than you. It doesn't feel good when the you're not on an even playing field and your opponent is only beating you because they've spent more money than you it feels horrible as there is nothing you can really do win. The core gameplay is fun, but this game is pay to win."", ""Pretty P2W in the higher trophy range. Though trade tokens can really help F2P players, they still have to be willing to spend a lot of time on the game (I literally mean 5+ MONTHS) to acquire max level cards (let alone A FULL DECK). Other than that, it's a really fun app. New Edit 2020: App is frozen and will not load. It keeps loading up to 50% then saying its updating on repeat. Fix it and I'll change my rating...""]"

All the animatronic are given good mechanics and voices which are perfect for being entertaining and scary. I don't experience any glitches although have seen them happen rarely to others sometimes, but at this point in time, I believe that there are none currently in the game. While there would be a few things I change, I wouldn't change much, Illumix has created a brilliant game."", ""It's a very good game! An amazing installment in the FNaF storyline. There are a few glitches, One of them is: When I tried to fix my animatronics, It would not let me. And once when I pressed the 'Recall' button it infinitely recalled them. I reopened the game and it recalled them though. But I still can't fix the animatronics. Also, Why are all of the robots eyes red? And they seem to be harder. Fix the bugs and you will get 5 stars."", ""I love this game! Everythings good with it, except one thing... I keep on getting in-game emails about how my bare endo has taken damage, yet it hasn't taken damage once. Every time I check, it's always 100% and idk if i should be complaining, yet here i am. Overall, the game is a fun experience and I would strongly recommend it, it's really fun!"", ""Overall game is simple to understand but not boring to play through thanks to the variety of animatronics and behaviour encountered. Animations and graphics are very high quality. Ingame flashlight battery doesn't take hours to fully recharge on its own. It does seem to consume phone battery fairly quickly though, and I do wish that parts had a little more use than they currently do. Nonetheless, a good game to get the blood rushing !"", ""I've always found it fun! But, I'm not sure if this is caused by the type of phone I have or maybe some other issue, but it is very glitchy. Times when I, for example, get the glitch teleport by Bonnie I'd quickly look away only for Bonnie to stay on my camera screen. This always loses my streaks and it's very annoying. And also the game also runs very slow when I've got my headphones connected. Not sure why. No one else seems to have this issue. Anyway, keep up the good work! It's a great game"", ""Overall the game is great. I love the fact they're making things easier to get through gifts so you don't have to pay crazy amounts of money to get stuff. I experience quite a lot of bugs including the gift box but I have contacted the support team and they were SUPER helpful and whenever they couldn't resolve the issue they added coins to my total, you shouldn't have guys! If your phone doesn't support AR there's not much the developers can do as only the company who made the phone can help."", ""Pretty fun game, for the most part everything works. Love the idea of going around the house searching for animatronics, and the models look really good. Only complaint would be, the mechanics of the game are in the mail. If it was in a more obvious spot with better access, I think it'd help more people out on what to do. Also, the shock button symbol is a bit boring. If it had steel shading, or just looked like an actual button; it would add so much more to the whole aesthetic."", ""Dearest illumix, I've been receiving this problem quite often and decided to write about it. When there are event(s) in your game you have a chance of getting a lot kind of stuff by pressing the icon every 3 hours in upper right corner. But, I've just entered the game and pressed that icon and I was happy when I got Toy Freddy lure, but it didn't appear in my devices, so it's like I got it, but at the same time not. Could you please fox that bug, because it gets very annoying and disappointing."", ""It's a overall nice experience and a great game. But I am having trouble repairing my 2nd Endo who is stuck at 75%.And the slowness when you try to click on the recall and salvaging button. If you could help fix this that would be great!

Keep it up Illuminix!!!! :)"", 'A great addition to the FNAF series, game play is pretty fun, lore is hinted at as well. All animatronics that have voice acting have amazing voices, the graphics are beautiful, the 3D models are extremely high quality, and the animation is really good. My only complaint is about why plagues nearly every single modern mobile game. Micro-transactions.', ""Very unfair with the reward drops. It's nearly impossible to receive any animatronic plush suits, CPU's, or mods. Definitely needs to be increased. Another problem I have is how every new character is harder than the last.

Like I said before this is one of the best games I've played👍"", 'This game is the most fun mobile game I have ever played and I freaking love the way the Animatronics act and the way the game plays out, however I do have this occasional glitch where my screen freezes on one spot of an area and when they appear right in front and I look away they stay on my screen and I die and although it drives me crazy when that happens, I still freaking love this game!!😀👍', 'After finally getting a device compatible with this game I was very excited to finally start playing this game and I was not disapointed. For a mobile game the graphics look fantastic followed by the animation. My only complaint Its probably just me but sometimes the animatronics location can be unclear sometimes especially since im just spinning around like a goof and getting dizzy in the process but then they attack out of nowhere and because I didnt get a clue of where there at i die. 10/10', ""It's very fun to play when your riding in a car or bus (as a passenger!) and have nothing better to do, it doesn't mess up my phone and me and my sister enjoy playing it. It is trickier to play in a car or bus, I prefer my backyard, because of the open space. Sorry if this rating thing is bad, it's my first time"", ""Amazing game. However, my account got reset because it didn't work, so I had to uninstall and reinstall, so I lost over 10 dollars worth of things, Animatronics included, but then, the company helped me fix it.

Its not perfect though it drains your phones battery (not in game) by putting on location. I suggest adding an offline/no location mode. Other then that the game is perfect', ""Great game! Although, some times the animatronics teleport behind me. Edit: Please make Baby easier. I think I had around 2 seconds to react to her decloaking and running before I got jumpscared by her. Please just make her easier. I had a streak of 10! Seriously though, make her easier to deal with. I'm sad now."", ""If I could give it a 0, I would. The opening sequence started and as soon as it got anywhere close to the end -I tried again for a 2nd time afterwards- it froze and wasted my time for about 5 - 10 minutes. I didn't even get to do any gameplay at all. I would definitely not suggest this game for fear it would happen to others and also get annoyed"", ""An amazing game. It has a slow-ish start but the hand holding is left to small notes that you don't even need to read. (Although I would recommend you read some) The controls are a bit odd but you get used to em fast."", ""It's a ar game with the fnaf animatronics not all of them but some you have to find the static you can use you flash light to hear it better but don't use all low power cause you have 100% power and you have to shock them so you can disable them and it takes up 10% battery so try to disable them good luck ;)"", 'Really fun, although some mechanics like the ""Berzerk"" teleporting move feel a bit broken and unfair. The tutorial needs to cover all of the mechanics because things like the mask arent explained either. The Email system is optional and making it so that trial and error is key is annoying. But all-in-all very fun.', 'hmm. this is an interesting game. this game primarily has 3 problems. - not really any help at the start,you are just thrown into the game without much info. - clocking system doesnt make any sense, nor does it work half the time. -what is the goal of the game?', ""I like the games but this game is a bit different chica ,bonnie,freddy and endoskeleton now always show up on my left or right but the thing i freaking hate is when i shoot the taser at them it never works they always atack me every single time the taser naver works but I still love the from the quality's this is why i hate it and love it."", 'Great Game Tho its laggy and crashes a few times for me its good game i have NEVER played a game as terrifying as this.. Great Job on game but when i tried to deactivate the radio jammer it does not work it just resets the time but it does not show it reset.', ""It's so fun! I love how It's free, and it is a cool concept for anamatronics to come to your house. You should get the game! The game isn't very scary, however; I do get a little jumpy sometimes."", 'I love games like this like vr your in there world now they get there time to explore our world and try to attack you and also how you assemble your animatronics and send them for your friends or get more parts by salvaging them that is why this game gets me interested.', ""SO GOOD! It really is such a good game no bugs or anything I just found it hard to learn a few of the animatronics mechanics but I'm slowly learning! Keep up the good work, Scott!"", ""One of the best FNAF games ever if you do not have PlayStation five nights at Freddy's help wanted then you should definitely play this because even though it's not official it is like Scott made it, and I mean exactly like he made it, and if Scott saw this he would be very impressed, keep up the good work 🤗"", 'Very very fun! I love the voices and the looks and movements of the characters. I really enjoy the collecting of plush suits and such. Mechanics are fun too.', ""Fix your game, whenever I try buying something with bolts it never gives me my stuff, and if I get my three hour reward it doesn't give me that either, I got a toy Freddy lure and it didn't even put it in my inventory, I love the game but please fix it"", 'I love the game. Scott put a lotya work into it. At first it was kinda hard to controll but then i fell in love with this game! And It has the same narrator from all the fnaf games!', ""Absolutely amazing. Love the game so much. Only problem is that sometimes I use a lure but it doesn't spawn the animatronic. I just used a toy chica lure for nothing ._."", ""Dropped my review to 2 stars because there is this glitch where the animatronics follow my camera when doing the glitch attack It happened 3 fricking times in 1 session with the last 2 being consecutive, if the 2nd one didn't happen I would have set a new high streak and would have unlocked a character slot and I was so fricking p****d when it happened, the only reaskn why I aint giving 1 star is because outside of that the game is still decent"", 'This is the best FNAF based game I have ever played, but if there was an easier way to be able to luwer one or random choice of 3 animatronics that would make it in my opinion a little bit more fun', 'I have played the game for around half an hour on an s10 and it lags badly when using the camera aswell as this it has a tendency to freeze my entire phone for a short while without me being able to go to the home screen or even lock the phone I would like to play this game but this problem is preventing me from doing so', 'Ok, the game got WAY better. I love the I attractive feel and the emails you get ingame. However, THANK YOU FOR THE FAZCOIN ADS. It was almost impossible to get Fazcoins until now! Thank you thank you thank you!', ""Everything is amazing, but Problem is some the controls in like for baby you have to turn as quickly as you're a can for An instant. And you can't repair the animatronics at all for certain players, but other than that it is great."", ""I love this game so much but there's only one thing there's a bug on when my streak is to 1 it stays there because I shocked the animatronics 2 times and it still puts me to 2 streak please fix this bug and thank you!""]"

Also its really a really fair game that even F2P players can catch up with the P2W with just a little grind! I cant say that i have ever had any strategy thag was so amazing and honest! Once again im really appreciative about everything youve put into the game and im trying to show some support by using some money, its honestly worth it! (I hope this review helped with you choice on choosing this game!)', ""I have played other mmo war games. You must know when you sign up to play a game like this that there are pay-to-win aspects. The spenders keep the developers going and keep the servers running. However, Lilith has made such an effort to ensure all players have a role whether F2P or spender. I played King of Avalon, Lord's Mobile, Game of War, etc. All of them you must spend to compete and participate. Rise of Kingdoms is not that way at all. Anyone can play. Find a good alliance and have fun!"", ""Game is fun and very addicting. About 3 months in (after learning the game mechanics) decided to create alt account i would start to put money into. I ran into some issues recieving pay rewards and their support team was able to help after 12 hours of complete silence. May i suggest putting your support hours and/or expected turn around time in the support chat so other governors don't freak out (like i did) when something goes wrong."", ""Overall, it's a good game. There's certainly the in-game purchases but that doesn't make the game P2W, in my view at least. Now let's go the negative part.I wanna give a higher rating but there's one major issue. The Geetest Verification system. It's completely rubbish. It kept saying Network Timeout or Network Failure. I've restarted the game and my internet. Same thing happened. To Devs, If the system can't even let the players verify, don't think about making a *fair* game yet."", ""Being a western gamer I am used to the same MPORPG, with the same, coin or die menality that I assumed was going to be the same with these guys. I sure was wrong. The game play is unique, great graphics, intersting plot, very good game. It get's better. These guys have methods in place that keep game play pretty balanced with coiners, so you can succeed either way. They read your customer service reviews your not just talking to a bot. They are very generous with game items keep it fun."", ""This game is highly addictive at first, but overtime it is really boring and only caters to the p2w players. The problem is you can't create your own alliance and let it thrive. It needs to have p2w players including. Most people that join will quit the game after 3 or 4 days and then the map is just full of p2w alliances that will contest one another. The game is solely p2w . F2p will suffer. They will outpower you easily. Its a problem in every server. And that's why I've quit this game."", 'Overall it is a very unique and first-of-its-kind game. But I feel there are too many restrictions when it comes to attacking other players, which is ultimately the most fun part for this kind of game. We have to worry about losing troops (which takes a long time to be trained), retaliation from the victim, the victim\'s alliance and sometimes even the King who tries to institute some kind of ""rule"" in ""his"" kingdom. This issue should be addressed in a way that it takes less effort to attack other players and those who are attacked only suffer a little and are encouraged to revenge.', ""Great concept, great execution. Be aware before you start playing this game, it's addicting at first because of the high rewards for almost everything that you do. You keep wanting to get bigger and then you get sucked in a Pay to Play loop. This is a tactic used by many mobile games but the developers of this game executed it perfectly. Players want to win KvK, but this game is based around how many microtransactions you can afford. Even P2W players struggle against other P2Ws."", ""This game is really amzing, out of my expectations, really. The buildings doesn't take long to upgrade, and you can also earn speed ups and gems really easily. The alliances are really good as well, you could help each other and reinforce each other just like a real civilization. You could also see the other players sending out armies and scouts, it's an amazing real time gaming experience."", 'If this game don\'t have ""Death Soldiers System"" it\'ll more fun to play. You just take some time to heal soldiers and enjoy the war again. But now, if you got zero and ""Soldiers Almost Died All""... The time and money you spent on this game = 0. You\'ll dispirit to play this game anymore.', 'well pay to win for sure yet I like it, addictive yes, as long not pvp u good with not pay to win or you alliance in the top 5. yet the dev made it almost impossible to get the upgrade golden leaders mission impossible. every single YouTube channel help u in this game will say the same u have to pay even the ones supported by the game it self. I suggest the dev of league of legends World of tank those two games were able to be fair games by not interfearing with develoption of player him self', 'Fun game, while its pay to win, but you still can keep up with just having fun, the VIP reward to stay online should be added, free to play players and moderete spenders are essential to the game. Give them a reason to be online everyday, something to reach. What use is it to be a whale when you dont have any opponent to conquer', 'A great game a it contains not only the city-building play - leave - return - repeat aspect of strategy, but also the active-game play all day aspect as the training time is minimal, and can be taken up by scouting and chatting in the in-game talk feature. The only way this game could possibly get any better is by adding the ability to have alliance watchtowers that leaders and officers could place, and also a wall version of this. My final request is the ability to trade with alliance members.', 'I think that it is very unfair that to get T5 units you need gems to get it done. It totally makes the game unfair as you need level 25 castle and research centre and to get that you need alot of gems. I really like the game and I know you provide ingame gems but it will take a year to get T5 unless you buy gems...and not even a little gems...you needs tons of gems!', ""Would give 5 stars if the game didn't constantly freeze at times and boot you. Love the layout and competition. Obviously this is a pay to win game and packs are pretty fair so i like it in that aspect if i have to spend a few bucks. Please fix the issue where it freezes and boots you. Games fully updated, amd i keep my mail and messgaes deleted. Inventory is well maintained as well. Thanks!"", ""The game is one of arguably the best strategy games I've ever played, and others could agree too.. it's not hard to improve and upgrade, and it's straightforward, also has good graphics and you don't lose a lot of your defeated, making it more enjoyable. It has its flaws sure, but it's a good game if you put time in it"", ""Your game has been crashing all over the place since your recent updates. Fix it already!!! Fyi most common and annoying crashes include when trying to open sunset canyon daily chests and immediately after killing some barbs. Switching to 1 star rating until it gets fixed, this is terrible. Just heard that you are now allowing 5 accounts each per kingdom. Uh whyyyyy. Greedy lag producers, now i know why it's soo full of laggggg. Not impressed with that decision !"", 'Pay to win and a lot of politics . HEAVILY PAY TO WIN. The chat is buggy + you cant get out from groups,small problems but who cares,you got a lot of money. The buttons somehow doesnt work eventhough u have a good phone,requires stable connection for stupid design. The game is enjoyable sometimes but damn the bug and error is never gonna be fixed.', ""Good time waster. Doesnt mean ALL good. But I've spent the past 2-3 hours doing nothing but play. I've played many games with the same kind of growth and progression, but they usually require an afk aspect. I like that this doesnt, and you can just keep playing."", 'Hallo, i agree on the review of the game that is not playable in long runs. You need a lots of money to be in the top. Guys - developers look how is clash of clans more interesting game than Yours. Learn from others and maybe, maybe you will make this game more interesting. I hope i will get a lots of gems because i wrote this review....hehe', 'Glitches in the game result in huge losses in troops beyond your control. Today i lost over 100k in troops due a glitch in the game. My troops appeared to fight the trees until they all died. I got 5 seperate reports telling me my troops had hit an enemy flag with troops inside. I have played this game for months and am extremely angry that this has happened.', ""What a RIP off, what were the dev's thinking when they designed this system. The over charge for resources (about $10 for 1.3mil units only to have another much higher lvl player come and take it while your at work or sleeping. They make progressions super slow so your resources sit there for the taking by any op player. I lost $25 worth of resources from another player that was 7x more powerful in one hour. That's 3 million total in one hour. I wont be spending another dime on this game now."", ""AVOID AT ALL COSTS! THEIFS They will ban your account and not care or do anything about it reguardless if you are right or not. This game is dependant on you paying with money. Infact they have made it so unless you pay, you have to play for years. There is so much discrimination and harassment in this game. AVOID at all costs! The second you contact Google they will ban you and you will never get it back. They don't care about customer service. It's automated too. Contact Google..... Banned.."", 'Fantastic strategic base multiple players time lines of history Nd fantastic rulers or war mongers of there time. Great citys of ones own to take time to develop and enjoy. Guilds and wars with rivel grouos. Can use multiple genrals from different times and places. Sy a historical clash of clans u could say. If you use Google pay cards a great time to use them as some $60 to $50 dollars worth of gems and extras to use fir free.', ""Thank you for your response.I know they are paying by which they are supporting you in your development but if they are getting 100 we are getting 10. At least make it 40 for free to play players.l tried hard on many events but it doesn't matter because you know it is not even enough for getting top 100 spot to win just one legendary sculpture.Ok thanks again for previous response."", 'Brought 3 sculptures to summon the legendary commanders using the medal store in the expedition mode, but no such sculptures shows up in the item inventories nor are there any summon options in the commanders area, not sure if this is a bit or not, but medals wasted. The game was addictive, but less so once I found out that I cannot expand by capturing enemy cities. The good point of this game is that the graphic and game play is really quite good compare to the games in the same genre.', 'The game is good and competitive but some of the research and training speeds are ridiculous. They need to reduce the times but at least 50%. Researching 30 days and over is ridiculous and building city hall upgrades 20+ level take 7days or more. Wow. Either reduce the times or slash the prices of gems and supplies by a substantial amount.', 'I love this game, and i just started playing. For people scrolling the reviews, this game is a total buy. But 1 note for the developers. My game will sometimes softlock when i either claim rewards or finish upgrading buildings. I cant collect anything or really play the game. It is very annoying', 'Allright , I gonna be totaly honest with you . It is pay to win yes but that is completly not my problem . Rhe biggest problem since last few updates is problem to even run this game propperly , bugs bugs bugs and its very and i mean very poorly optimazed . Chat is bugged beyond fuctioning . Laggs are everywhere you look , on blue stacks on this new version it crashes every 20 mins or so . In this stage of development i would say DEVS look only for money and are not willing nor wont to fix this', ""I've paid many games in this genre/style, but non compare to this game. I played king of Avalon over 2 years, and I like that game, but this takes what it offered and builds on it. Graphics are clean and most important make room in your day because it's soooo addicting.two thumbs up."", ""Too much happening all at once. App is either lagging or kicks me out of game. [Resolved] This latest update gave the in-game chat even more glitches. I can't scroll up because it always goes back to the latest chat. Or it freezes and i can't type. Or a chat group from another kingdom appears. I like this game and would like to give it a higher star but communication with alliance is paramount."", 'Again my only real complaint is having to hold your ""Scouts\'"" hands and tell them where to go next. Instead it should be you tell them to go out for a timed window, and they just focus on getting rid of automatically. That way you can focus on mining, farming, growing your forces, etc... Great game though!', ""What the heck is happening to this game??? I've been killing barbarian non-stop but it's not added to my score??? Don't don't forget the lag, the graphics are in low mode already but it's still lagging. At first i really liked this game, but now?👎"", ""Hello Lilith Im experiencing a problem with one of my Characters. The Problem is not the account, Phone or network the Game works well the only problem is the only one Character on my account that I cannot open it because it crashes in 10 seconds the other character has no problem and im still using my account and my other character in different kingdom. I always tried to open it everyday but still hasn't resolved so to change in other characters I have to do it fast because it 10 seconds the c"", 'This is a very very good kingdom game. Unfortunately it is very hard to be a truly F2P player. You can but its much much slower. Best suited to casual spenders. I really HOPE they increase the rewards etc...this could be a mamoth game if it were more free focused. Remove action point boundaries and increase farming returns and barb rewards 👌 Still, though they could improve few things...im a loyal player and this games SERIOUSLY good 👌', ""Great game however support do not care about the player base. Certain regions get cheaper packs and also, they do not care about cheats. Every kingdom I've played has players using bots to fsrm rss and grow at ridiculous speeds. Lilith need to fix this or the game will die, support dont seem to follow up quickly or seriously, and I've heard they even make bots themselves to generate extra income!"", ""Those who don't spend money in this game is actually useless. Those whales are having a good time asserting their dominance. Verification is done almost every hour, which annoyed me. Chat is broken for weeks. I reached out to support but I only received generic troubleshooting guide."", 'Unless you join the biggest alliances, expect to get attacked by players much stronger than you. New alliances get wrecked pretty fast too, so after awhile it feels more like Rise of Bullies. Otherwise it is an interesting kingdom building game. Having my troops tied up with hospital bills when I log in because someone 10x stronger wiped them again, is getting old.', ""This game sucks I played every day for about 100 days in a row I put easy over $300 in to the game just made it over 10 million in power and then my card didn't recognize one of the purchases from this account and they refund 3 purchases maybe equaling to like 50 bucks worth now they have restricted any movement or any playing on my account pretty much band me when I was willing to work out the situation now I am completely FUC* out of like 250 bucks because the game and they have no customer S"", ""Honestly, even if the game was designed P2W, I still love it and play it everyday since I have been playing, from a year now.

Thank you for playing Bid Wars and, please, don't forget to leave your feedback and a new review!","['Fun game that can be very frustrating at times. The AI will go crazy for bins with next to nothing in them spending thousands and yet still come out with a profit. Cant make money when they constantly run the bids up way higher than what bins are worth. Needs to be a bit more balanced and fair. Not saying i want everything handed to me on a plate but ive been in this new area for a week and have still yet to make $1000 profit yet the AI always seems to walk away with around $1000 every round...', ""Rather fun, but I don't know why they have energy levels. I would play longer (more ad income for developer) if it wasn't for that. Too many free games out there for this retiree do dish out money for games. This could be my favorite game if not for that. Could be a trap for gambling addicts. Update - my current fav game, energy levels or not."", ""I like playing the game and it is great. However for the last 4 months I have clear San Franisco level 41 is the highest I've gotten to. I check at least once a month for updates and when I do it. It is only to do a holiday theme or something like that. No advancememt on the level or other cities. I am getting tired of playing the same level and just being stuck. Hopefully I get a chance to update soon to advance if not then I might just stop playing for now. Thank you."", 'Fun and addictive game. The pawn shop is a cool addition. My problem is that they seem to have gotten rid of the option to purchase power up bundles with gold and can now only purchase each individually. Not impressed with this. BRING BACK THE POWER UP BUNDLES!!!', 'Fun game. Sucks to get outbid, but it makes you think and prioritize your spending! Been playing a while now, and the AI (computer) bidders are ridiculous!!!

One problem... and it's a big problem... the game will never be finished! You're only allow one store and it's full of limitations. This is like putting custom wheels on a car that doesn't run!

For a free player, there's a bit of a grind in the later stages to unless more levels."", ""Too many negatives with this game but I still keep playing solely because you can play this offline. My biggest hate of this game is the bidding, the starting bids are way too high and you get bid up like crazy on EVERY! Unit so even if you do make a profit it's no more than a couple of hundred, so progress is slow. When you are online you get an ad after every level and in game promotional ads. I also feel the energy you need to play a level is too much, unless you watch an ad."", 'Worth more then 5 stars ! ""Bid Wars"" is the only game that\'s not strictly after getting inside your wallet ! You\'re not bombarded with ads & pop ups telling you that you must give them $, and then more $, if you\'d like to continue to play. There\'s some ads but you can mostly skip through them. Very challenging and really realistic ! Thank you to the developers for actually caring about the product, (""Bid Wars"") that they put out there for people to enjoy & it not being about greed !', ""I like the game. What I did not like was how when I got to a certain level I couldn't go on anymore. Because the amount of bid bucks It takes to move on to that level. Is nearly impossible to achieve. Therefore basically requiring me to buy more bid bucks. And the amount that I would need to buy would cost me like $50. This is just a game I play. During my free time at work. It's not worth the cost of Call of Duty. I would have given the game five stars. Had this not been the situation."", 'This is a really Fun game but cant play for long periods of time, this is due to the fact each round you play runs off of ""Energy Points"" once all used you need to wait for your next energy point....YES, YOU ONLY GET ONE, every 7 minutes or so! I played this game to relax and take my mind off of reality but this downfall in the gaming set up is 100% complete and utter SHITE!!! JUST LET US PLAY THE GAME UNTIL WE DONT WANT TO ANYMORE!!!!', ""It's a game that continues to update and change without ever really changing it's game play. The new option of watching an ad for an extra pawn visitor is cool, but I would change it to become more of a game of chance. Might I suggest that different members of the crows equal a different number of visitors? At the moment it's just one. It'd be nice to see a range from 0 to 3. It's just a thought."", ""It's a good pass time game, just gets a bit boring seeing the same items, a bit more variety please but otherwise worthwhile.

When these ""bidders"" bid thousands and thousands on 2 small boxes and ""somehow"" win over 8k......well, it gets old. And their sole purpose is to bid high enough that you can\'t get any profit. Time to delete.', ""This game is all about getting your money. You can't really win units without buying their items to unlock the values of the units to know what to bid since most everything is hidden. You can memorize items worth but you lose 30%of the time unless you spend your real money. I'll play for a day and get bored."", ""It's a good game. Wanted to wait until I got to a certain level to see if the game mechanic changed (lvl 12) and so far it's consistent.

But..... I do not like the Market Update that took away the Power Ups Bundle. I also do not like the way you moved the power ups into the auction screen instead of being at the bottom of the screen out of the way of the auction items.', 'This is an excellent game. Good graphics. The only snag is that I am at a stage where you expect top shelf items for auction. You expect to auction some cars, expensive jewellery, ancient memorabilia and so forth. I really hope that this auction experience can be improved.', 'The game is fairly entertaining if you are just trying to burn time. the main problem is energy takes so long to accumulate. Another thing, in the pawn shop, it would be nice to have the offers come in a little quicker.', ""Pretty fun game. Would like to see more updates, more frequently. Once you reach the last level, there's not much else to do. Without updates, it gets a little stale."", 'Because of boot icon that was in front of a plastic green box in one of the storage units I could not finish cleaning out the unit .I lost 35 gold , all the money invested in 3 storage units and all things from 3 units.

Looks crappy on the outside but worth your time 👌🏻👍🏻"", ""The intro does not to a very good job at explaining the game but if you go to the options you can click the learn how to play which is more descriptive.

I am interested to see what else it has to offer."", ""Game has a pretty good basis but eventually as you get to higher levels the need of items is a must and these items must be paid forcing players to either pay or uninstall the app. I enjoyed it but as soon I noticed this I've decided to uninstall the app."", 'A medocre recreation of the legendary Newgrounds game ""Tentacle wars"". Pros and cons: + This game is playable on mobile. - The controls for this game are way less responsive. I haven\'t actually played far enough to see any pay to win, but I\'m expecting it. I haven\'t palyed far enough to see how many levels are on this; Judging based on the outward presentation I\'d expect more level in this game, and much lower quality of design.', ""I cannot enjoy it. Tentacle Wars last update was years ago, and it's still better than this. Coloration and menus are bulky, and the AI don't differ at all. Back in TW, Red was basic, Blue was smart, and Purple was deadly-- here, they are just colors. While TW did have a tutorial, it didn't last five missions and didn't keep popping up at the start of each stage. I only reached stage 15, but I can't keep going. I didn't even look at the micro-transactions, but they're probably horrible."", 'Edit : After 500 levels it became very difficult, had to use power on three occations. Previous review: Completed all 500 stageswithout using items, trying to get 3 stars in all stages. Great game Completed all 300 stages. Only two levels where i had to use items. Approx 10 stages were very difficult, had to play multiple times to win without using item. Are there more stages coming', 'First 30 levels or so are taken straight out of tentacle wars, but then they start making their own levels. Controls are slightly less responsive and it is more difficult to tell exactly where everything is going. Cant count how many cells you have connecting something anymore. Is good, but not quite as good as tentacle wars.', ""Ok so im giving a more accurate decription so here you go. One i like the game because its really a puzzle of what cells should support and what should attack, on top of that there isn't really much inturuptive adds in the way of things. And in the grand sceme of things it's a mobile game that i'd recommend due to the fact its just inspiring to do better because you can isolate your errors. Truely the best game i have seen in a long while."", 'Bull feces in later stages, enemies use items I guess and transform your cells before their health even reaches 10, items cost money and are not given specifically for certain levels making the game a one sided mess in certain levels, forcing you to pay for items.

Its time consuming, its takes skills to play and all but i think the items needs to be a little cheaper to buy. Its kinda pricey since you don't make much coins every round especially since it took me 183 levels to make 600 coins to buy 2 or three items only."", ""Controls are confusing for a long while, levels eventually reach a point where if you wanna win, you gotta cough up coin for items.

About 200+ of them on the first go. You just need to know how to loop your cells or when to push aggressively. I would consider paying for another 200 new and challenging levels for example. Thank you for good bit of fun :)"", ""It was all right. Until lvl 25 I do not see how I can possibly best this level without using the 'cheats' you can buy. Don't earn the coins necessary to get more unless counting adds. 2/300 coins to buy two or one things depending on. Start with 30 coins each add gives the same. Edit 1.

There are customisation options (skins) allowing you to change the effect that different sticks will have.

And add more units', 'I think it is amazing, great game. I restarted the game and beat it once on accident and I cant beat it now because the boss is so overpowered, dude I had 9 giants killing it and it did like 1/4 of its health and then the archery dudes are like useless. You should nerf the giant in the end and make more stick characters and make like another part of the game like more levels, but yeah it is a great game', 'It\'s good and all, but you should add an online multiplayer mode, or even ranked games so we can climb up ranks, that will make the game much more ""enjoyable"", if that\'s the right word. But its still great, its just my suggestion. Otherwise its a great game, keep up the good work!', ""Everytime it asks if I want to watch an ad to double my rewards, it plays one even if I say no. I give easy 5 stars if games don't jam ads down my throat constantly. Also tired of this enemy reinforcements BS that spawns in triple what they had before when their statue is half health. The only thing this game has going for it is being a nostalgic replica of the pc version, other than that it's mobile garbage."", 'This has been a fun game. If I could suggest expanding the campaign not with difficulty levels(easy, normal, etc.) Expand the campaign with a new army that is taking over the world and we need to stop them with our forces. Possibly adding in another unit like a ninja(increased speed and slight high attack but low health) or knight(similar to spearman but clad in armor and sword with the only upgrade being slight boost to defence and attack but starts with stats slightly over max swordsman)', ""It's good, adds aren't overbearing And the game runs smoothly.

DISCLAIMER: No underpants were harmed during the making of this update.","[""Honestly, this game can get pretty addicting. Though it does have it's complicating situations here and there. Like with getting new cards or a good card deck. Or sometimes small glitches can ruin an experience. But I generally enjoy it when I'm bored. Though, I don't suggest it if you hate games that slightly make you wanna spend money. Or some people don't play fair. But if you have nothing to do in your free time, /maybe/ try it out? Can't speak for everyone though."", ""My biggest issue with this game is the fact that it doesn't have cross-save even though it has cross-play, I put a few hundred hours into this game on iOS and not being able to carry that over to Android is ridiculous. Matchmaking can also be pretty unbalanced, still after many updates. Achievement rewards are broken on Android, they were fine on iOS. Add cross-save support, please. Other Ubisoft mobile games have it through simple Facebook integration, no reason this can't have it either."", ""PVP connections can be very poor and cause your players to not deliver all damage. It will seem as if you're deck is handicapped. The net result is that you lose matches. I've reported the issue numerous times to the development team over the past two years but nothing has been done. They either don't believe it is happening or don't care."", ""Honestly, my opinion. There's still a lot of people hacking the game, & manipulating it. Causing it to be difficult for those who actually play the game properly, to enjoy it. I see it a lot. It's an issue when there's level 10 -12 (New Kids) with level 3 legendaries, level 7 commons, level 5 or 6 rares, and level 4 or 5 epics. Hacking currency! I have noticed a pattern to this. I'd give it a 5 star, if the PVP was more evened out & hacks were fixed!"", ""I actually love this game but the reason I'm only giving it 3 star is that the game have alot of bugs. 1st one was sometimes I would deploy a unit and would just stop moving not even attacking which is annoying specially on pvp. When you're trying to move up and you just going to keep losing because your unit isn't doing anything. That just makes you want to stop playing. Another one is sometimes it would kick you out on pvp for no reason it would say connection lost even you have internet"", ""Used to be great. But now they just let the game run wild with energy hackers who can apparently drop 4 5 and 6 energy characters at a time even though there's an energy cap limit of 10. And then they can beat lvl 4 3s and 4s with lvl 1 Gizmo Ike's in one hit without multiples. I mean the hacking is blatant obvious. Until PVP is fixed I wouldnt install or play and I won't be anymore until they do. Theres also no way to report hacking."", ""I originally gave this a 2 star review due to the horribly mismatched pvp matchmaking, but I am happy to say RedLynx has actually done a very good job addressing and fixing much of the issue. It's still not perfect, as the amount of points gained or lost is still based on opponent's score and not their level, which is frustrating, but the matchmaking itself is overall much improved. Good work."", ""I adore South park so my bias is to really like this game. The cut scenes are all fantastic! And the single player campaign is decent. Unfortunately PVP and team wars really let's the game down with it's ridiculous match making which makes collecting and levelling cards (the whole point of the game) pointless. Bugs and glitches are common place. And its in reality a pay to win game (terrible value too) trying to play for free progress and success is so slow, again there's no point."", ""A bit glitchy and slow to load. Also very fun but very expensive. Don't expect to get anywhere if u don't spend cheddar. Entirely dependant on internet connection. Too bad it isnt a real game that u buy and enjoy. Free-mium sucks. Wouldn't surprise me if these types of companies get nailed for gambling via internet. Just waiting for the lawyers kid to spend too much and not get a refund....then comes the litigation - no more free-mium Update 2-14-20 each time I open the app it downloads 1/4gb."", ""It's a great game BUT somehow you need to monitor some of the pvp players that are 10 levels higher than you, losing until they can play in a lower tier and play someone weaker. Its BS. EDIT: Still nothing has been done about players deranking themselves even though there's forums everywhere about it. Changed rating to two stars from four."", ""I love the game but I'm having issues with the campaign to be honest the pvp everything else is wonderful my problem is the MP c's so every time you go and go fight one of the bosses like ninJu or the with the great wizard They're able to summon characters that are already on the playing field when you are not able to do the same be honest it's an unfair Advantage."", ""Overall they do a very good job adding new content to keep the game new. With time and some grinding you can become competitive as free to play also. As with all free to play games to be number one wallets are involved. But this game has been fun at any level of gameplay. I havent found many games with the real time head to head gameplay like this for mobile. It's great."", ""The game looks like so much fun, and I wish I could play it but I can't. After beating level 3, Cartman gives me my first premium pack for free. I click on I and nothing happens. I got stuck on a screen with four card packs and a finger pointing at the bottom of the screen. I reset and even deleted and redownloaded the game, but nothing works."", ""Very reactive playstyle. The campaign plays like an episode of the show. Additonally, people who complain about resurfacing charatcers or cards not appearing after play simply need better connectivity. I have this issue only when using terrible wifi. It vanishes entirely on the home internet. Complaints about P2W format also aren't true. I paid once and the rewards I got were worse than the free locker rewards. Do campaign missions if you want strong cards - 9/10 rating for SPPD."", ""Game bugged in the shop when opening first pack. I can't open first free pack and I can't continue or change menus. Reinstalled 3 times with no results. It's a shame, seemed like it would've been a fun game. GG Edit: just fixed it, if anyone else is having trouble with this, change your screen resolution to the lowest option in your phone settings and reopen app. (Phone is an S10)"", ""Game is broken for s10, can't get past free cards section and there are no inputs available. Game forces you into area and you can't get into the settings once this part starts. I can see what is supposed to happen but the game can't seem to align with the screen resolution and everything is out of place. It's completely game breaking less than 20min in with this phone."", ""Too p2w. Constant offers to try and get players to buy the cards that will help them improve their rank. Designed to make people addicted. Desperately needs server side which we were promised we'd get by summer 2018 and was then never mentioned again. Too many bugs and cheaters in the game. Definitely would not recommend"", ""Terrible, can't move past arena 6 , so many glitches, literally will beat someone and actually get counted as a loss a deducted points , if the other person bails on the match during pvp matches, automatic loss against me , can never get my arena rating above 3100 , tried spending money in hopes the app was more favorable towards me and of course no better off . Don't know what's up with this game , but its completely unfair when it comes to fighting another and very badly matched"", '[Playing on a S10+] Unable to continue through tutorial when trying to obtain the free pack they give you.cannot scroll or click where they are telling me to.

Likely nothing will be any different in game..', 'Love everything about the game. Onky thing is the loading process. Takes too much time switching between screens.

They also refuse to address the rampant cheating in the end game (lvl 17+)"", 'A bug affecting Google Pixel phones causes the player profile to change and game to reset constantly, sometimes in a loop. Any switching away from the app and even dismissing a notification causes the game to reset, losing any match in progress. This has been reported for 6+ months with no fix.', ""I made some good mates. If it wasnt for them I'd have sacked this game off along time ago. It's fun but theres bugs that have existed in the game for ages that still havent been addressed or ironed out. Sometimes seems like RL dont really care about their reputation. The front liners such as toller and buck are helpful for the most part as well"", ""1st you nerfed half my team so now I'm stuck cant loose points or win games. You nerfed mind control, now it's so delayed it misses the enemy most of the time. And every time I'm about to win a Challenge match I get an error 200. What is up over there?

GIJ 1.1.3","['Not bad, I know this game is new but it needs some work and some balancing. Hopefully they will be adding additional characters and equipment. Also, the graphics are a little to cartoonish, some additional detail would be nice. Would be cool if they used music from original tv show from the 80s instead of the generic music they are using now. If they address some of these suggestions would give 4 or 5 stars. CAN YOU PLEASE ADD A FUNCTION TO LEAVE THE APP? THERE IS NO WAY TO EXIT GAME.', 'The game is fun but the customer service is slow. The game glitched. I tried to purchase their welcome packet incidentally purchased it twice and got nothing. Contacted them six times and gave them the transaction numbers. I only spent four bucks but what would have happened if I would have spent more or anybody else. Eventually they gave me my money back one and gave me a little Xtra resources for my inconvenience.', 'I had reinstalled this game & I was playing daily saving up close to 3000 silver event coins and then they resetted SMH. I bet they only reset to force you to buy coins. All this purchase heavy content in mobile games just made me break out & hook up my Xbox 360 to play GI Joe: The Rise of Cobra... I really just wanted to play a GI Joe game and this game isnt it so Im done with this game. Im going back to my xbox & now Im uninstalling this game for a 2nd time..', ""I like this game. The only problem I have is that apparently you can't carry your buyout coins over after an update. I had over 5,000 coins saved and now I have to start all over trying to get them back. I would've given 5 stars had that problem not occurred."", ""I love it because it's GI Joe That's the only thing keeping me on it. It's definitely pay to win and it really has a lot of flaws. From the gecko everything is expensive. Everything takes a long time to upgrade. And costs a lot to do so. And on top of that you only get one Builder which is unlike any game and its class and is very very very inconvenient."", ""It's a good game but I had to Uninstall it due to the constant freezing and/or crashing and kicking me out of the game. Shame considering all the time and money that I put into the game. When the crashing and freezing issue is fixed then I'll reinstall and give a 4 or 5 star rating. Until then uninstalling the game. But other than those two issues, I like the game. So please fix them so that I can reinstall the game. Thank you."", 'This is one of those which while fun to play when first downloaded, becomes a chore to play due to the necessary resources needed to successfully play the game. Sure, this is a""free game"" but you\'ll never get very far in this game unless you purchase in game resources. I feel sorry for the children who play this game and need real money to get very far. Let\'s face it, this game is targeted to children but it\'s the adults who pay to win who will actually, you know, win.', 'Frequently get false notifications. Too much cow clicker aspect of frequently needing to check in and harvest. This game is similar to the Boom Beach style (for comparison). There is little benefit seen so far to be in an alliance (occasional donation of cards which itself is frustrating since you can miss your chance to request cards). Please upgrade the alliance utilization. Please provide one button for collecting resources in the base.', ""It reminds me of my childhood alot :3 Also could you add the tank like vehicle that places a bridge and use it to make a bridge over mines like in the show but it goes over landmines instead of ravines, rivers, Cliff's and etc also can go over tank traps as well Thank you for reading this please take in to consideration"", ""This is getting annoying and stupid, game keeps having network problems, used wifi with 10Mbps speeds that can play PS4 games and Steam games no problem but for some reason this stupid game say my network is problem. Tried mobile internet with same speeds that can stream 1080p but this game says that my network has problems. What the heck. Do not buy anything in this game, it's a joke. Also I didn't know if my language Indonesia contains inappropriate language in English that I know."", 'So the game is fun, but has balancing issues, and it is a bit broken. When my troops get stuck at the water line trying to attack a turret in the water that they cant reach while the rest of my army is getting killed because it is attacking the main base is a major issue that needs to be fixed. And dont get me started on how broken snake eyes is and how hard he is to kill, when i have 3 maxed out lvl 7 squads against a lvl 1 snake eyes i lose every time.', ""I'm a gi Joe's fan since I was a kid I had the entire collection of gi Joe's from the play sets to the action figures to the vehicles air ground sea I still have em and I'm getting tons of money for it since it's old school now after 10 years finally innovation a game for android phones that's impressive I paid real money for packs so totally worth it only I'm afraid of losing my data and purchases"", ""I have personal nostalgia for this series, otherwise might be a 3*, is. I like the being able to switch factions with ease. I don't like how I'm not sure how this affects my actions. Also some clarity on the rewards systems (battle tokens) would be beneficial."", ""I want to like this game but the bugs are starting to get under my skin. I've lost out on all the current event rewards cause the game will catch an error, then delete all my coins. This is a hot topic in alliance chat, so I know this isn't an isolated issue."", ""Yay another greedy moba game, that craps over your childhood memories and expects you to fork over money because you know, memories and all. Typical pay to win which is a shame given it has the Hasbro logo and youd expect better. Game doesn't even attempt to hide its greed from the very start its sit and wait or speed things up by using our in game currency which will cost you out the rear to get any enjoyment."", ""Game is bad. The more I play the more I'm dissatisfied. Battle system is dissapointing. At level 10, I get destroyed constantly by level 13's and I can barely beat level 6's. Severely imbalanced. If you're Cobra then the Joe base Ironjackets destroy you since illogically only 1 specific troop can fire at air targets. :-/ Have to constantly use gold to get new targets, but keep rolling bases that are impossible to beat. Only 1 builder and no way to aquire more. Event are unrealistic past level 6."", 'The graphics are fine the game play is fine, when it works, but the constant freezes in battles, the game drops, the glitches in loading, the fact that your own bases defenses don\'t even appear when your being attacked by another player. Crashes and burns this game right now, and that\'s only the glitches in the game. Then there is the uneven balance of one side, no side should have the power to control another side character, turrets are fine there ""hacked"" but the characters is going to far DOC', 'Game has gotten beyond stupid.. Build your base... and nothing else. Nothing to do otherwise. No side battles, arenas, or anything.. It was awesome until... Pay to play, and if you pou pay... you get less than what you had.... From 5 to a negative... 12 or less', ""Very slow in the beginning, searching for a clan Shows every Clan. Available at over 200 days or more of being absent and inactive. If this isn't the biggest hint that people do not want to play the game. I don't know. What is. Also searched 15 different Clans all the same affect. Reading the rest of what people wrote is also disheartening."", 'It has been pretty fun so far, but there are a lot of issues with game mechanics and awards. The cool thing is that G.I. Joe has lots of characters and vehicles to pull from. We should be allowed to field more forces at a time.', ""Defeated numerous bases but I don't get any of the resources even though the game it says I should have. This alone makes the game totally broken as it's nearly impossible to progress from the resource generators from the player base."", 'Can only go so far before needing to spend lots of money. And the constant attacks without a shield depletes your resources quickly.', ""Hard to keep trophies up without spending money. You can only gain trophies 6 times a day but lose far more. Only one builder so it's hard to build up defenses when they take 12 hours to build."", 'You can play as Cobra. Amazing. However the game really does limit the rewards for playing more than six battles a day, which is odd for this style of game. And the ""starter pack"" is $20. I\'m a firm believer that a starter pack should be 99 cents. It gets you used to paying on the app. I did a $4 purchase. Which seems like the lowest thing to buy. I\'d like to see 99 cent packs.', ""Not bad, could be better. Combat and UI feels cramped on a phone. Resources feel too derivative of similar games. If not for the IP, I'd have already uninstalled it."", 'Fun game. Microtransactions are a big part of the game, but fun can be had if you play casually and grind a bit. Definitely a must play for longtime GIJoe fans.', '0 (zero ) star if possible! Concern with tank traps that are missing or dont connect when someone attack my base (both cobra and joe base) already updated the app latest version but did not fix the issue!', 'More nostalgic than anything. Like most mobile app games, it takes money to truly progress through quickly. Otherwise it takes HOURS of waiting to open treasures you\'ve already won. The gameplay itself is decent, nothing out of the ordinary or extraordinary by any means... ad I said before, it\'s a nice ""in between"" game to play based mostly off of nostalgia.', 'This is a fun game. It is similar to a few other games I have liked, but its G.I. Joe. That said, the game is way to slow in many ways. One cargo/builder at a time being the biggest. You would spend way to much real money to get past this and I like the game but not that much. Next up I would say there realy isnt a lot to do in the game. I think more to do and a cut in time it take to get you cargo from battle and this game could be 5* but right now its half hour play two times a day.', 'huge $$$ grabbing game. If you want a character your looking at a lotta cash to get em. you have to spend a thousand coins to carry over only 100 for character events. It takes me, using the app daily, the whole event time to get just over 1000 coins and it takes 15,600 coins to buy out a character. So at this rate it will take me 156 events which take a few weeks per character event. So 156 events at 21 days per event ÷ days in a year (365)= 8.9 years!!! To get a character for free. $$', 'The graphics are awesome. Though how different units are obtained is unpredictable at first. But all in all, Yo Joe!!!', ""I do enjoy the game. It's a tried and true model, as you can see from the many comparisons in other comments. It's just a nostalgia tapping cash grab. I played your game, and ranked accomplishments in the event to be able to open 10 of the loot boxes for the special event character - not the easiest task. You scammed me both times. I'd invest in something that I felt invested in me, more. You just tap my nostalgia and love for GI Joe."", 'I downloaded this for a laugh after watching ""Internet Today"" and spent approximately $2 just so I wouldn\'t have to wait. Upon playing for 3 or so days. Maybe even a week it occured to me that- the game kept downloading 60 megabytes for no apparent reason, the intervals of megabytes would change sometimes 61 sometimes just 60 but thats still weird and almost unacceptable. But then the online aspect. Literally its just premade levels. Otherwise, there are no players as no one plays this game.', 'May return after bugs are worked out. Have spent the last 2 weeks playing the game, upgrading and unlocking. When attacked lately my tank traps vanish as well as my mineral deposits and I get slaughtered. When attacking you have the option to resupply all for a certain number. When I attack someone else after I am given another total to still resupply. There is a lot of hurry up and wait while upgrading. I want to like this but I am too frustrated.', 'Beats the monotony of other base building strategy games. The GI Joe universe really shines here unlike all of the other toy/show/game crossovers. There is an artificial play restriction in the form of resource costs significantly outpacing collection capabilities. Of course you can spend money to reduce your wait but you will just end up waiting at the next barrier to progress. It is good for 15-30/mins a day without spending. I wish there was some unique rewards encouraging me to spend money.', 'Allaince feature is dead all ""recommended"" allaince leaders and its members are all inactive for 150+ days. Alliances with this amount of inactivity should be deleted in the system also it takes 4, 8 and 12 hrs to open a crate which takes too long. If you dont use gems your playtime will be put to a hault cuz there are only 4 spots for a crate so this means if you have 3 unavailble spots you can only atk once. Once you reach lvl5 game starts to loose its F2P aspect.', ""As an Old School G.I JOE fan from the 80's it's pretty cool to play an game with characters that I loved playing with.

And put the detail of the troop when we taphold him, so we can choose a better troop to use.. and please, dont make HIGHER LVL IS BETTER, ITS SO BAD. Thx', 'I have had good experience.

First is that the world boss only appears once every 24 hours. This is an extremely bad idea, have it appear every 3 or 4 hours instead, so people in different timezones can join.

· Authorization Requirement Cancelled","['The art style is appealing. The world is built well: The resources, the characters, the environment all feel like they have a place in the world. Gameplay is overall satisfying. The story can be a bit overwhelming, especially in the beginning. The pace of the text is a bit annoying, as sometimes your only choices are to either wait for it appear or skip it. I would also like to see more Male characters/operators.', ""A fun game, only a couple of minor things holding it back. They need to make it so that you recover your sanity (the stuff you use to get into missions) a little faster. Also maybe make it so that you get 11 characters when you spend 6k of the in game currency. It already costs 600 for 1 so there's no point in saving in saving up for a 10 pull for 6000. There no benefit to saving up and waiting. Other than those issues it is a fun game."", ""The game is great, characters are interesting and they're designs are top tier. Gameplay is simple and easy to get into but higher levels will definitely require strategy and effort, so you can't just breeze thru the entire game. Gacha is decent, you get enough on a weekly basis to do a few pulls on every banner. All that said, my only gripe is the stamina situation, potions have an expiration date and you can't hoard them."", 'This is the best game ever on mobile. Storyline is on-point and can easily be made into a series on its own. The whole incentive mechanic is perfect. Everything else from the arts style, smoothness of gameplay to the challenging aspect of the game are perfect. The difficulty of each stage is very well tuned, such that I need to make important strategic decisions on which operator to place and the timing and sequence etc. Good job developers, I am speechless.', ""A highly thought provoking game. An excellent choice for people who are not into PVP games but still like team and character building. Place your various players on maps to prevent the infected from reaching the end target. Manage your base and supplies to continue to build your team to progress further into higher levels of the game. It's a well put together game. Not buggy. Short server maintenance occasionally. In app purchases are not overly pricey. No Ads to watch. Worth playing."", 'Love everything about this game, definitely a fan for life, currently level 66, the sanity cost isn\'t that much a concern considering how often you get the primes for 3 stars and challenge mode (if you\'re good)..my only concern is playing a mission to get a certain item and I may not get it after completing, if I\'m spending 30 sanity and end up not getting the item shown on a mission, that\'s kind of a headache. The ""quantity"" should be random with a 100% guarentee that you\'ll get at least 1.', ""This game is amazing! I like how you give credits to painter and voice actor for the character, also this game is fun. I love to read story but sometimes it get boring for some reason, but this game have storyplays and even a strategies battle frontier at the same time like you can imagine what's going on. The characters are so pretty and even have many voices command if you wanna hear, very interesting. Give it a shot on this game and I promise you that you will like this game as I do"", ""Fun, fair, F2P-friendly and -- most importantly -- it doesn't overwhelm you with stuff to do every day. I don't understand the people who complain about the stamina limitation. Do you want to waste your life? What's wrong with you? Also, ignore the losers that complain about the gacha rates. You don't need 6* characters to be strong. Heck, you don't even need 5* characters, and you get quite a few of them guaranteed. The 2-4* characters are actually useful, unlike those in other games"", ""5* If you're simply a tower defense/gameplay person. 2* If you're playing as a collector (which is me). There are fail safes, like a pity system, or just straight up buying a 6 star from the shop with special currency. But 1) To activate these fail safes, you need to spend a lot, either in time or money. 2) The rate at which you get premium currency is like, FGO rate. When there's a rate up for a character, don't bother hoping to get what you want. You'll probably get a character you don't want"", ""Hands down the best tower defense game ever made. No debate. Don't be deceived by the implications of that genre either. There is deep strategy in this game with tons of map diversity and no puzzle game style p2w powerups. Also incredibly generous for a hero collector game. Some of the best units in the game are available in the guaranteed 6* pull you get for free, and you also get a free 5* of your choice from a selection of some of the best 5* units. Gacha rates are also pretty good right now."", ""(Some what) New Take on Tower Defense If you played Bloons TD 6, and enjoyed the way the heros work, this could be a good game for you! Yes, the game does have its own form of cost to play each level (Sanity), but they are very nice about it. In your early levels, you gain a ton of Sanity, if you fail a mission or restart, they give you most of the sanity you spent back. Even for higher levels. The way operator leveling works is one of the best I've seen, and every level takes thought to beat."", ""This game have an excellent user interface, make navigation between the menu quite easy to do. Probably the best UI among the plenty gacha games I have played. It also helped with how snappy the gameplay control is. Placing the operator and directing it had a good feel to it. On the relevant note, character art is so pleasant to look at. Every operator seems very fashionable. I'm eager to see more costume releasing in the near future."", ""This game is amazing. I don't usually play games on my phone, but this game has gotten my attention and it has me hooked. The characters are amazing and cool. It's F2P friendly and despite what people think, 6 Potential your units is not a must (It helps but not a must) I can't wait for the things to come with this game!"", ""This game is really really fun. Sanity proves to be kinda of a problem when you need to grind out mats and xp. Also, some levels are too difficult like sending too many enemies right off the bat or forcing the player to use a certain strategy, but it's fun to have the challenge. But the most annoying thing about this game to me is the DP cost of some Operators, AoE operators cost too much, do little dmg, and sometimes have no range like Lava and 12F, they have 28 DP, little range, and do ~200DMG"", 'Arknights is great game and it is completely free to play. I love how low rank operators can hold their own and carry you quite far into the story. Best thing is how the game requires more strategy than power to complete a mission. Character design is also amazing and I love the aesthetics and mood of each character. Only thing that SLIGHTLY bothers me is the Sanity (in-game stamina) cost of material grinding levels and the amount of Orundum you receive per week. Other than that, amazing game.', 'I was interested, being a connoisseur of gacha games. The characters are cute and somewhat interesting but ultimately fall a bit flat. The gameplay is tower defense and it starts off easy but gets pretty frustrating in the latter levels. Sanity (stamina) is scarce and the premium currency even scarcer; which makes the already perilous gacha pulls even more risky. There is also many off-putting mistakes in the writing, grammar, syntax, etc... It has potential but the devs need to capitalize on it', ""I just try this over-hyped game. I found outstanding GUI, sounds, and characters. However, the gameplay is not very interesting. There's no chance for shots to miss, it's so unrealistic and too plain. There' no chara with throwing type skill (which only able to attack far foes & helpless for foes that's too close), I need that to exist in this game. Also less to none options for skipping unimportant animations, base should be 3D and customizable, and the list goes on... Need so many improvement."", ""Many of the reviews here complaining about the gatcha units make it seem as though high rarity units are mandatory in this game. Which makes it clear that they havent played this game for more than a day or two. Look at all the 3 star unit guides on YouTube. Rarity is definitely not an issue in this game and getting high rarity units isn't really hard considering there are multiple ways to get them which are free and easy (recruitment, credits, free units etc)."", 'Having played this game daily for 2 weeks now I can say that this is a very good game. It is a strategic tower defense game but your ""towers"" are anime girls with animal ears. You collect different operators that each have different abilities and bonuses. You can level them up with materials that you can collect and farm for and has an autoplay function that you can replay previous missions that you have 100% completed to not make the process tedious.', ""Fun tower defense game, cool character design, interesting and well delivered story. Not only that, even low rarity character can be usefull. Then the gacha system is decent too (if you fail 10x pull just try 1x pull, it works to pull one or two *5 or *6 operator). Last note, you can grind as hard as you can and the game still rewarding you or you can go whale if you want... it's your call."", ""The fact that this is a TD made me disappointed at the start,as I have never been fan of those type of games. Have been playing since release,and it has slowly drawn me in by the fact that it's unique game compared to their peers. The game isn't without issues, but its really well crafted for what it's supposed to be."", ""Level 53 in the game. Made quite the progress in a month of playing. I give this a 5 star because of how much I've enjoyed the game. But do keep in mind that there are flaws within the game. 1. Sanity is the energy in the game, and once you run out, it takes a very long time for it to fill up again. 2. Lungmen Dollar (LMD) is the currency in the game. And oh boy.. it is so scarce late game. Grinding cargo escort for only 7500 each run taking up 30-35 insanity and the cost to E2 is above 120k"", 'The story is great, the art is fantastic, the gameplay is super fun. I love the base feature, and how even the lowest 1,2,3,4 star units are super viable even in super late game. However because of trying to catch up to the cn servers, the rate up banners are so short, and the amount of free gacha summon material is so low just like the rates the fact the banners dont garuntee you the units you want is also a huge bummer for waifu collectors.', 'First off i have never been much for mobile games, but ended up giving arknights a try due to very little free time to play on console and seen ads here and there. This game is amazing! The characters, the gameplay, and story are all very fun and engaging. Being able to put together unique teams and conquer the levels with a multitude of playstyles and strategies. Absolutely love this game, play it all the time now even in my free time. 10/10 for me.', 'By far the most interesting gacha game available. Engaging gameplay and very F2P friendly. Clearing stages requires smart unit selection&placement and each will require different setups, especially later on. Gacha rates could be better (looking at Azur Lane), but the most common units are also completely viable. Energy system caters to multiple short daily sittings rather than doing all dailies in 1 (meh). Artwork and Character designs are absolutely stellar (and very tasteful). Story is ok.', 'This game has alot of potential. Character design is good and it has pretty good balancing, there are no must have over powered characters so far. Could definitely use a sanity cost adjustment for alot of things. Getting chips to upgrade units is probably one of the best examples. At lvl 48 one run costs 1/4 of my sanity to run a chip pack mission that gives 1 chip and I need 5 per unit plus it is 1 of 2 chips that drip so I may not even get the one I need. Otherwise great game so far.', 'Decent rates with a great pity system makes 6 stars very much available for all players. Content is clearable with 4 star and below operators as of current (Ch4). Character design and art is amazing, especially E2 art. Gameplay is tough yet rewarding. Clearing stages with lower level operators or a niche strategy makes it really enjoyable. Very much a side game. Stamina wall makes it difficult for f2p to play more than twice a day. Overall a great gacha game that wont burn you out', 'Horrible difficulty incline that requires you to grind and use your sanity for the week to even max a elite operative. Will drain you of every penny if you want to have a full squad maxed to even pass a level that you won\'t be able to anyway unless you use certain operatives that you don\'t have because of the nonexistent ""guaranteed 6*"" headhunts. Had it since release and was super excited but you get stuck with the same operators and no way to gain new ones. Highly recommended to uninstall...', ""Great game, really fun to play. The UI is really simple and interactive to use. There's so many lovely & cute characters in the game. The gameplay is really challenging & addicting. And a note to the dev, i would like to suggest that please add a notification when your sanity is full. 10/10."", ""The game is good in terms of strategy and graphics. Then UI is very modern and very F2P friendly. But the down side is the energy system is very very limited and real money only after you run out of free originites. Imagine playing any games and every 15mins the game became unplayable cause no more energy and you need to wait 10hrs to play a 15mins session, there's no chat so you need to find friends on facebook or reddit, no guild and no pvp."", ""This is the game I've been waiting for! The character are so cute and handsome,even the storyline is so good. But the reason i give 4 star are because of the 10 pull price and the rate up of the gacha. I hope this issue will be improved in the near future. Ps:i really want ch'en but i have e rank luck so when her gacha appear pls wish me luck ╯﹏╰"", ""I really like the game, it's fun but the thing is. You literally can't get supplies, because the second and thrid levels are way too difficult for begginers to even pass. It gets really fustrating to be honest, this stresses me out more than my projects and i am not even trying to make a joke right now."", 'I find that sanity and lmd are too hard to come by because almost everything requires those 2 and sure materials are also needed but that requires sanity to grind for them because otherwise it would just turn into a waiting and grinding game rather then a gacha/grinding game. Other then these issues is for certain requirements to unlock something,they can be properly shown rather then being stuck with trying to figure out what was missing.', ""I'm honestly flabbergasted. Beautiful art, amazing community, interesting story, interactive devs, strategic gameplay, and truly F2P! You can clear EVERYTHING with the low star units that the game gives you. No unit is weak, meaning everyone has their roles. Some simply perform said roles respectively better. The gacha rates are honestly the fairest that I've ever seen. Every new banner gives you one 5* or higher operator within the first 10 pulls. So you'll always get a 5* each banner."", ""Just amazing tower defense game. Its unique its not like the avarage game wich fire is weak to water and water is weak againsts wind,no this game have a very different mechanic also the character is just so amazing the characteristic and model wise is so fitting, if i were to say what's the weakness of this game? The sanity(energy) to play the game recharge so slow but then again i dont care cuz i love this game and im rating it a 5 star"", ""It's a tower defense game, so don't expect gameplay beyond placing various units strategically. However, outside of combat there is a leveling component to your units, different categories of heroes that serve different roles, a base building to craft material to enhance units, and a gatcha element with favorable drop rates. All of these features make for a fun experience; however, there are too few ways to get premium currency, which is the only way to refresh stamina outside of 1 weekly item."", ""Tower defense meets gachapon rpg. It's fun, looks great, and I don't feel overly penalized for not spending money. I'm just not that into the tower defense style gameplay, even though it plays well, and find myself losing interest. If you're into that sort of thing, you might love it."", ""Amount of energy you get is pathetic. You play 4 two-minute-auto stage and you cant play anymore unless you pay money. You don't get to play the game. As for gameplay, lot of hand holding for first part, quite tedious. Mid game is the best as lots of thinking and trial and error is required. Late game falls flat, energy starved. My suggestion to developers is to double sanity recharge rate or reduce the sanity cost of each stage by half. Also to develop more difficult stages other than story."", ""Disappointing. For a game with so much hype, the amount of grinding later in the game does not work with the game's stamina. As far as energy based games go, this is the worst I've seen. Leveling your characters are done by farming materials, yet you are capped at a low limit with a slow regen rate. There are very few events to provide sanity and the amount given is so low it doesn't add any balance to the game. This game is pay (for stamina) to win rather than free to play friendly."", ""the game overall is really good , artwork good , storyline okay , f2p friendly , but it would be better if we could get some more ways to get orundum , you know so we can get a better chance to get our favorite ops since the only way that we can get now it is through annihilation stages , which only available once a week , factory's originium shard kind of suck , not even worth get it . this is my opinion . thanks for your time , love the game . keeping up the good work guys .""]"

You don't just kill other caravans, you also design your own caravan from being destroyed by others.

No irritating ads, and the offers are provided in a manner soothing to eyes and without distracting from the gameplay. Great job developers."", ""Alright I am playing this game kinda on and off... I really love the gameplay, trying around with units and improving them. Tower defense is fun anyway, and the visual style is like a mix of Minecraft and Clash Royale, very adorable! Progress is slow but even with very little real money I make nice progress in the leagues. However, what really annoys me is the amount of ads. I know those in the town are voluntary but they yield a lot of gold which you NEED SO BADLY! There's always at least three when I start the game. How about a $2/month subscription to get the gold without ads and possibly other benefits? Would be worth it to me. Furthermore there has to be different tilesets! The forest and fields gets boring, how about a winter and desert looking tileset? Even if only seasonal, it would spice up the game a lot. At least for seasonal events, if nothing else. Please improve the game and I will continue supporting it."", 'I loved the game. The entire idea is really awesome, attacking, stealing, defending, towers, troops... BUUUUT... You can only farm gold from deliveries and the gold you get is nothing compared with what you need to upgrade stuff and the delivery count is limited, which makes the game boring.', 'Looks like crash issue is now fixed thanks for working on it and the new addition looks great with the Hero Shrine. I like how we can interact with the battles and undergoing the Campaign to get stronger towers. The Clan Wars weekly is also a great addition. Getting Battle points is also nice the more you get the higher your rank gets currently Buffalo 3 aiming for Rhino then ultimately acheive Dragon status.', ""It's so easy to get cargo but hard to get coins.. but the capacity for coin storage is larger than storage capacity per level. Tendency is you'll stack too much cargo than you need and you just continue to play along when your cargo capacity is full thus the cargo you get from raiding would be useless"", 'The creator should have a mode that players can loot or farm gold', ""I love the creativity that the game offers in how you choose to design your caravan. Decent amount of strategy in troop placements once you hit level 16 with the double caravans. I'm not fond of the new hero system which you level up through a slot machine - it is too random and can leave people sitting on thousands of xp. Also the other problem I have with the game is that I'm constantly sitting on full cargo at hq17 . This means I have little incentive to ambush. I miss 2hr Max longest trade""]"

Then when you reach the Challenger arenas, players that are 3 levels higher then you start matching with you. It's ridiculously annoying when your just trying to play and you go up against higher level opponents. It's literally impossible to beat them. The game is literally pay to win. I've given this game many chances but the matchmaking always ruins it."", 'So while I love this game and the game mechanics behind it, it is the most out of balance game. Not in the units, but in the matchmaking. The game pairs you up with people of similar trophies, but will decide when you win and when you lose. If you are too high of trophies for your level, it will pair you against decks that are meant to counter you. If you lose too many times, it will pair you against decks that you counter. There is no strategy in the end, just divine intervention from the devs.', ""I think it benefits players who spend a lot of money on the game to much. For the people that are free to play it's not so great. I heard it's supposed to be random battles, but when you start to win several you start getting matches against hard counters. Usually several in a row. And people with better cards. So it looks like there just trying to get you to spend money for upgrades. About to delete the game."", ""I don't understand who did the match making system but I don't think they understand the concept of balance. When you go into a match and your cards are out leveled by over 3 levels and your tower is under it makes it nearly impossible to even come close to winning. They tend to also favor putting you in those kinds of matchups after you win one or two games."", ""I mean I think the battle pass is a load of rubbish but apart from that it's still an amazing game and I enjoy it. I think it has gotten a bit too easy now though because it is really easy to get to the legendary arena and higher, back then it was nearly impossible to get to hog mountain or the other arenas that used to be the best. Oh and legendaries are really easy to get too. Apart from that, it's a good game."", ""WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!!!This game use to be fun until supercell got greedy. There's no strategy anymore... the game will be over before it starts based on your card selection and you can't see your opponants.

However it is hard to level up in this game which makes it frustrating when you face people of high levels. Supercell doesn't fix the level issue because this doesn't apply to the pros who are all already level 13. I HOPE Supercell can make it easier to level up to make this a game more fun and enjoyable and not just cashing on gems and stuff to try to level up."", ""I really wanted to like this game. I love the concept of it. But the matchmaking is horrible. I play against level 12 when I'm level 6... How does that even make sense? Also, the way this game is designed I'd that if you win 2 games in a row, then you lose 2 games in a row. It takes SOO long to rank up, this is more of a grind game. It's also a pay to win game, you can win just by paying. It's so stupid and the game is SO bad. Like, hackers in this game is too intense. Every 10th game is hacker."", ""App is great but ever since last night, it won't open. I tried getting help through sending feedback but haven't heard anything and got an automated response through email telling me to go into the game & ask for help from there but I can't do that since I can't even get in 😩 hopefully I get some help because I'm scared I'll lose all progress if I uninstall & reinstall"", 'Base game is entertaining. The better you get at the game though the more you realize the faults of it. Forced slow down with chest openings creates a need to purchase ways to open chests. Purchase prices are incredibly difficult to stomach. There is no player report button so the higher level players will cheat approximately 60% of the time. Clearly a lack of concern from the developers', ""I have played this game for 3 years (which they have failed to recognize) and I hate it. The only reason I still play is my friends. The pairing system is aweful. Cheats are also allowed. It's a pay to win game. I'd you pay for gems, you'll be better. No matter what. I'm a strategist, and I won most battles.

I have the screen shots as proof and would post them but google play doesnt seem to allow that.', ""It is a good strategy game but it has some flaws. Good part is that it has awesome graphics and easy to use. Bad part is that at some point, you get to battle against players who use money to get cards especially legendary ones ... and it really annoys me. It isn't fair. If you use real money to buy cards or chests then you should only get to battle those who have done the same. Seriously .....I get really annoyed. The matchmaking is really really bad. I would give a 2 star off 5 for it."", ""It's a good game for strategic players. But I it should also have a report option for the players who leave the 2v2 battles in between the match or even after starting a match. I really hate when such players enter as my partner in random options. So the developers should think about it and come to a decision for this problem. The worst thing about the game is the tie breaker. I don't like that."", ""It's a nice game if you like live action strategy. Stack your deck and use it wisely. You get a lot of noobs when you first start playing but as you level up and collect trophies things get more interesting as you run into more evenly matched players. The only drawback is the wait time to open chests is a little long. Quick, fun, and great for playing on those short breaks at work or at home."", ""This is a great game with an easy concept. That only problem with it is the same problem they have with every other supercell game. The matchmaking. They love to put you up against people that are so high level that anything you use can and will get one tapped. Other than that not too bad. Some op cards like the Pekka and mega night will never be fixed. I've come to terms with that😥"", ""from a player who played for 3 years 1. the inevitable problem with the so called free to play games like this one is that sooner or later you find yourself playing against either suckers that are several levels higher than you ( because they paid more) or noobs that you crush easily. there's rarely a good game win or lose. there's no satisfaction. 2. matching mechanism is especially bad for this one. 3. balance changes are a joke. one only needs to check their twitter account for history."", ""It's great that this game listens to the players at the highest level and makes balance changes based on that, but the normal players just trying to get to arena 13 or whatever are completely ignored. Players have been asking for nerfs to cards like wizard and mega knight for a while but they just get ignored and end up playing against them almost every game. While they aren't good at e sport level, the majority of the playerbase isn't e sport level and they suck to play against constantly."", ""It's a great game that just keeps on giving. I've been playing for over 4 years and it's still one of the only games I haven't deleted. Not only are you able to talk, play, and share with friends but you always having something new coming out like a new character card, new challenges, new bounces, and even more like the new pass royal that let's the hard core players get more for only $5!!"", ""Absolutely horrendous. Pay to win trash. What a giant turd this game has become. So much non sense going on. I need to spend 20 minutes just opening chests and watching slow animations while they try to sell me a fake with fake cards for $99. Are you kidding me?! I wouldn't pay a dime towards this awful game and you shouldn't either. Pay to win. Pay to win. Supercell has ruined games with a hard push to force kids to spend big money just to compete. Shame shame."", ""Note to retard developers: Although you may THINK you are punishing players for losing their connection while in a battle by not allowing them to team up for a time without letting them know that anymore because you know as well as we do that it isn't fair.... But it won't stop players (wink wink) that KNOW (statistically) when they are going to lose to just stop playing. How dumb can you guys get?"", ""Full of pay-to-win people, not fun at all. You don't need much skill to play this game, just pay them money. They don't support free-to-play people and their 2v2 algorithm is off balance. I had to fight a level 11 at level 6 multiple times. I don't recommend this unless you want to waste time. Disclaimer: This game will make you mad. I would rate 0 stars if I could"", ""To the Developers: my cards are at max level and now use stars. But i only get half the stars awarded to me. Example: When I open a chest it tells me I have a number of stars 155 and when it goes to tally up the Stars after getting out of the chest screen it's always Tally's up as much less 61. What gives? I'd like the rest of my stars so that I can give you the rest of your stars. I keep getting short changed on stars. I'm still wait for developers to respond! *****"", 'If you enjoy constantly being mismatched against opponents who have higher level cards and towers than yourself then this is the game for you. Supercell keeps doing ""balance changes"" (read random card changes) but don\'t address the horrible matchmaking algorithm, the entire way that they match you against opponents is based solely on your trophy count so you get punished quickly for having success and if you want to play for free forget about it unless you have years to dedicate to a mobile game', ""The game is absolute garbage. Based entirely on money spent and luck of the draw for your deck. The matchmaking is incredibly flawed. You'll be absolutely screwed of your WiFi is bad. The deploy time for the card can increase fivefold if your game loads slowly. The game clearly registers the play, but it won't implement it, meanwhile, your opponent gets a free run at your towers."", ""Gameplay is fun and requires having a good strategy. That is all that is good with it. The matchmaking is trash, does not matter how good your strategy is if you get paired with opponents who are at least 2 levels higher than you in both long tower level and card level. It's getting ridiculous what's it is next to impossible to advance in trophies. I get the pass but this matchmaking I think it's just the game developers trying to get you to spend tons on money on gems so you can buy upgrades."", ""Could be a great game if it weren't for the serious Pay to win issues and fundamentally flawed matchmaking. I am routinely matched up against max level players (I'm level 11) with mostly or entirely maxed out units. Essentially, at least one of three things is true: 1) Matchmaking is rigged to discourage consecutive games 2) I'm so unbelievably good at the game it's only fair to match me up against impossible opponents 3) If they don't take card & player lvl into account, its simply bad design"", ""Addictive game, but aparent speed hacks. If you don't have the speed hacks don't waste your money trying to level your heros the speed hacks are faster and more powerful. How the people that made this game don't know about it is silly but it's what it is. Great game though even better if everyone was on the same playing field. Thumbs up"", ""I've played this game since launch day and it is still a very unique and fun game. I only have one major problem and that's the Mega Knight. The pay-to-win players use this card nonstop and it completely destroys everything and honestly is ruining matches that could be competitive. I'd say fix Ram Rider as well, but atleast you can get away without it completely destroying your towers. Simple balances would make this game as close to perfect as it could be."", ""This game has become quite unfun. Almost 80% of the games I play, I get matched up with players with higher levels. And I'm constantly going against the same overpowered cards. Example: I always get matched up with players who use Mega Knight and Magic Archers. Both of these cards are super OP and definitely need a nerf. It's really frustrating to play a game that's being structured to aid those who pay. Overall an unbalanced pay-to-win game that I would NOT recommend new players to download."", ""This is a amazing game. The patience you need in the game is amazing. The only reason I don't give it a 5 star is because you need pass royal to do alot of nice things. I get to get the best treatment you need money thing but some people don't really have money to pay for it. I just wish they gave commoners a better game experience. Also trading is annoying because you always need to have a trading token to trade and it's hard to get those. But over all an amazing game and highly recommend it."", ""Don't bother paying or playing. Played for 4+ years and can't take how rigged the game is. Nobody will admit, but when they want you to lose a game, you'll face some impossible to beat combination and they'll never make a mistake. Basically playing vs an AI opponent. They do this so they can limit the free rewards you earn by winning, and therefore require you to pay for cash rewards to progress your account."", ""I actually stopped playing for a while and I've just returned, just to discover that it has become way, way worse. Every single card that they have added is worse than the other, I get put against players who are times two from my skill level, and this is just the most sad thing I have ever seen. From the best mobile game this app has turned into a pile of trash, and I'm really sad to see this happen. I hope they can fix this, but in order for that to happen they need to remove every new update"", 'Good app but not for free to play gamers like myself. It\'s been over 2 years since I\'ve started playing this game but gems and coins are a major limiting factor to my progress. *Edit* Over the past few years I\'ve seen great improvements in terms of how f2p players are treated and I greatly appreciate it. As for the gameplay, however, realistically there hasn\'t been much added that screams ""what a huge overhaul"" Improving my rating from 3 to 4 I love this game and am looking forward for newstuf', 'I have been playing this game for a long time, and I just have to say that it doesnt get boring. Well done Supercell for managing to create such an amazing game! Personally, you guys should include some sort of water character. There is just no water in it. Overall, though it is really fun. Great work.', 'Not paying for another month of premium till you start changing things for the better. No innovation in game modes, same old ""this spawns on either side"". Most challenges are either a roll of the dice or to easy. No new ideas. More chest slots? Where is a 2v2 ladder? How about a pve mode versus waves of enemies? How about a spell card that shields an area from spell damage for a time, so there is an actual counter to spells?', ""The tiebreaker feature sucks, forcibly moving the towers' health in order to create an outcome isn't the way to create fair game play. The matchmaking for 1v1 is trash. I have won a fair bit of level 12's when I was level 9, but I'm seeing people who pay to play and max out their cards at level 13 and absolutely destroy other players. It's not fun to play. This game is becoming a pay to play ghst forces you to stay at the same level and pay $5 a month to play. Not worth it. May uninstall."", ""It's not Clash of Clans, that's for sure. It was fun, but a little too easy. Plus, if I'm paying for the Gold Pass in one game I don't want to pay for it in another. Without the Gold Pass, it gets boring. 3 out of 5 stars because it's a good game, just seems like a simplified version of CoC."", ""The gameplay is good, however the matchmaking is so shameless. Playing vs players at the higher ranks is always against people with higher level cards than you. It doesn't feel good when the you're not on an even playing field and your opponent is only beating you because they've spent more money than you it feels horrible as there is nothing you can really do win. The core gameplay is fun, but this game is pay to win."", ""Pretty P2W in the higher trophy range. Though trade tokens can really help F2P players, they still have to be willing to spend a lot of time on the game (I literally mean 5+ MONTHS) to acquire max level cards (let alone A FULL DECK). Other than that, it's a really fun app. New Edit 2020: App is frozen and will not load. It keeps loading up to 50% then saying its updating on repeat. Fix it and I'll change my rating...""]"

Have played it for many years since it first came out and its only gotten better with time. The Warships mode isnt for me personally, but I'm still glad they continually try to innovate and make the game better than it used to be. The play style is extremely flexible, literally a style for everyone, even the pacifist who doesnt like fighting, just harvest your resources."", ""update sucks! everyone you get paired up with is grossly better equipped than you are. totally unfair way they match you up with opponents.update. I posted this a while ago and this issue still hasn't been fixed, especially when you get a new engine room. I'm constantly getting matched up with people who are 4 or 5 spots higher than me on the upgrade tree."", ""It's a pretty fun game; I've been playing it for 2 years or so. It's a cute distraction. 6 months ago I the game would crash suddenly, saying that the server had become disconnected. And I would lose whatever progress I was making in a battle. Very frustrating. The developers should fix this glitch, or at least give us a win for every battle that we start before the system glitches out."", 'The game as a whole is ok. Unfortunately, the devs of late have been lapse. The gameplay of warship is unfair, you constantly get put against opponents that are far stronger and have unlocked warriors and abilities you do not possess, there is no way to win. I will no longer be playing the warship part of the game and will no longer spend any money on the game as a whole. Congratulations...', 'The game is fun but i wish we could play a mini game that would cost coins or gold.

Unfortunately the warship portion tends to be drastically mismatched and getting worse rather than better. I even stepped away altogether for a while over it. Hopefully you'll figure this problem out before I just delete the game from my phone completely."", 'So as you build the base it becomes exponentially difficult. If you use real money to get in game resources, your base can get destroyed and whatever money you are saving up goes away.

I've played every season so far.. and it's impossible to get going. I and many others are just stuck throwing matches until we drop down to a reasonable level. And then what? We all just race to get the heavy helicopter? Wow.. that was fun at first, but it's really taken actual creative playing out of the game."", 'This game is AMAZING!!! It is so fun and omce you get to hq level 8 you can do so much and it doesnt take long to get there. There is so much to do too. You can join task forces (join mine its bombs awayyyyyyyyy) but you also have a alter base with all the best defenses and offesnes and you just battle and unlock rewards. And in task forces you start operations which everyone in the force works together to beat the 2-7 bases. I would defintly recomend this game.', ""It's fun, but has some issues. The first is that you can get attacked by people way stronger than you. I just got my base destroyed by someone 2 levels above me, they had zooka's and way more soldiers and I can't even attack them back when I have better stuff, they are just gone with 5 hours of base raiding worth of resources. Thank you, for ruining my day the second it starts, someone had to do it I guess"", 'It is not a bad game, but after awhile, it got boring.

I think maybe I destroyed 8 engine room's, after probably 60 to 70 attacks. Tried getting my 3rd engine to see if it got any better, but NO.

On a good note, the Mega Crab is great."", 'Every single time I try to get to rank 16 in the warship battle thing I always have people who destroy all engine rooms in less than 40sec and they all have everything unlocked while I cant even compete, this always happens when I get to about 10 stars away from rank 16.

I\'ve tried EVERYTHING!!!!! Thanks for taking the game away from me supercel', ""Enjoyable game with annoying bug - if I lose signal, even if I get signal back a few seconds later it won't let me actively continue the battle I am in, the battle just continues on its own. This is most annoying in warship if I lose signal before deploying troops as it means I automatically lose as I can't go back to the battle and deploy then - even when I get signal before the battle has finished. Not sure if this affects others too? Makes playing very frustrating in places with poor signal."", 'Best game ever but I purchased diamonds purchase went through but never received the diamonds and it is a hell of a task to email supercell to rectify the issue.

They need to work on their support system seriously', ""I've been playing for 3yrs now so take my word that If there was a 0 star rating i would have used it.Don't even bother downloading this game coz it sucks. Imagine a level 65 raiding a level 30. To can't even do nothing, you can't attach coz the map is full of players whose bases would crush your troops in seconds. Very unfair game. I advise you go and download a different game coz this one is just poor. Very poor game balance, giving the strong players and the pay to win guys a huge advantage."", ""Fun game until mid levels then the opponents become so hard. 10 to 12 levels higher then you. No way to defeat them. don't understand why they would make a game you can't play because your opponents are to high so your only choice is to shut it off and do something else. Seem counter productive. The game is unplayable at this point. just do not play for a few months to get your opponents back down to your level and I mean do not turn this game on for months."", ""Warships again become a farce. Rather than being about troop selection, tactics and skill. It again is just a case of who can fire their guns the fastest. Very disappointing again. Thought this would have been resolved as every previous season has been like this, but alas, this season is the same. It's just a waste of time playing the Warship side of the game"", ""I have been playing this game since maybe 2015, and it was great alllll the way up until NOW. This game is controlled in ways I never knew til now. I'm really starting to notice alot of weird things about this game. Warships is one, it's like no matter what i do and how fast i get done the opponent seems to ALWAYS win, it's RIDICULOUS!!!! With all that said I am gonna separate myself, because I don't feel like I'm getting a fair chance. So I HAVE TO uninstall."", ""I have enjoyed this game for over a year now. It's slow paced with lots of waiting for things to build but you can progress without spending money. The recent warships update is a huge letdown. You end up in some really frustrating loops where you just win and lose and don't progress. When season 2 started I went 1 win, 1 draw and 8 losses to start the season. Complaining will only get you canned but polite answers. It's an update that actually makes me want to play less. A waste of your time."", 'Good game but need alot of improvements, i got a draw acouple of times on the new battleships mode and how is that even possible when i have destroy the opponent and have even watch when opponent still has 1 engine to destroy and i still get a draw???! Needs to fix that getting anoyed with that', ""Great game, an upgraded alternative to Clash of Clans. I had this game before, but I re downloaded it. I recommend it to anyone who plays other Supercell games. However, I have a bug that stops new bases becoming available for me to attack and submarine dive spots don't appear as often as they should. Otherwise, great game. Keep up the great work Supercell!"", 'Chromebook support has been restored in the November update. Plus they have finally added additional levels for those of us who have been maxed out for the past three years. The game is alot of fun for those who are just starting out. It can be alot of fun even if you dont put money towards the game. Buying the instant troop for $10/month is a fun upgrade since it will allow you to really grind in the game.', ""Game bacome laggy. On entry and mid range devices (also older devices)the game play isn't as smooth as it is used to be. Unfortunately in the menu there is no option for reducing graphics. i recommend if you can't fix the situation at least put an option to reduce graphics for older or weaker devices. If this is not much to ask. I have 4 different devices that i can't play the game smoothly on them."", ""warships was a great way to expand the gameplay. And I enjoy watching my base grow stronger over time. Very intuitive and strategic gameplay. Supercell has a knack for doing extremely well in the app/mobile game industry . I only complain that I cannot get my Google play games to connect. But that's a personal issue and has nothing to do with the development teams amazing work and doesn't make the game any less enjoyable and fun."", ""Love the game! Every improvement makes a big difference and a more rewarding experience. Thank you Creators of Boom Beach. Keep up the great work!!! Update#2... I had a rough time with the Warship game but I'm here to say I really like it! Every season is getting better. The only thing I have a problem with is the beggining when you have to fight with the infantrymen.its so hard to win with them. But all's well with boom Beach and I love it!!"", 'This is a great game wish you could buy it. What a rip-off to want me there pay 99.00 dollars for fake crystals. I love this game but not the purchase part of none real items. Let me buy the game and find the things I need. My console game are not even 99.00 dollars. There is so many other ways that do this, it all the purchases not just the 99 dollar one. Thanks. Why do I lose progress on bases I can not defend', 'Game was good at one time. Now they try to make it almost impossible to defend to keep people playing. Instead of improving an equal part defense/offense, they launch warships which is terrible. Game used to be so fun. Now everything geared toward money. The new stuff getting too stretched. Sad to see it go. Task force players almost non existent anymore', ""The game is incredible well made, very entertaining but it is drown back by the thing that it's entirely pay to win. You can play free of charge but you need to be a veeeeery patient person and play for years to reach high levels. I understand that the developers needs to gain some money from this, that they don't work for free but in this game it's just ridiculous. The game its made in such way that it forces you to pay so you won't loose what you worked for such a long time."", 'Loved this game for a while. Thought the new battleship idea would be awesome. Then i find out that the game and designers have no problem with cheaters. I brought it to the attention of the support group and all they said was, ""unfortunately we can\'t help you with that, contact us if you have questions regarding a different subject.... Genius....😒🙄', 'Ive been playing for 5 years. It was fun, and very very addictive, which is the only thing that kept me going. This game is only for people who can spend money on premium currency. I cant, I wont. Boom Beach just wants your money, the developers always have these stupid offers, and i mean ALWAYS. In warships the matching system is ok, but when i destroy their engines or whatever before them, usually 10-20 secs, they still win. Cruel, and stressful. Dont play, if you cant pay. The devs dont care.', 'Without a doubt the worst season of warships. The fully upgraded rifleman, which used to be formidable, is now brought down by anything. The warrior wont go under tje smoke to a target and if he does defenses keep shooting like theres no smoke there. So i have troops that drop if u yell at them facing fully upgraded defenses. No way to win let alone destroy 8 engines to get upgrade tokens. Quit playin cause theres no point. I was an everyday player, a spend money player. No more', 'Great game, great graphics, gameplay is solid my only complaint would be for the warships that the date till the next worship is available would not be so long I like playing the worship as is. I feel that waiting about a week is too long.', ""This a great game of you are looking for some challenge and strategical game!! Whether playing on warship or in task force, there is always something to do. The only problem there is that it's hard to make changes to your bases, after you get new buildings. Please consider adding an edit mode where you can edit freely and easily.""]"

Second problem mission ""None shall pass"", There no way of passing it because my gunboat and next level boat are 2 weak.

Unless you buy your way through it, you can only store a maximum of 6,000 crates and that means no more building because you'll have insufficient storage space and will need to purchase gold bars to advance any further."", 'The wait between attacks while the troops rebuild is too long, it spoils the game play, I quickly lost interest in playing, which is a shame as the game has got good graphics.

• Technical improvements to support future releases
• Bug fixes and optimisations","[""I play the game sometimes on my phone which runs quite good, then when I run it on my tablet (4gb ram and 30+gb free storage android 8, realistically I doubt it will get android 9. Brand new only came out in 2019). It judders/laggy why can't you optimize it for tablets which are not as powerful as expensive phones. I don't want to strain my eyes looking at a small screen while playing games all the time."", ""A fun game, but I have a few problems. One is the Revenge attack option. When you get revenge on someone, they can attack you back. Thai goes on for forever, and it's no fun. Another is a glitch where you get a 100 percent raid, but lose credits for it and get 0 percent. I am not sure why this happens, but one clue may be the fact that I cannot review the attack. Also, the troops that target turrets shoot at everything in their way, and they die because of it."", 'I absolutely love this game, and am addicted. I actually use to be level 7 on my Kindle but then I lost my progress and then the game got discontinued on Amazon devices so I was out of luck, but now that I have it back I am already almost level 4 after two days! The only complaint I have is graphics. I also have a suggestion, if you use gems to speed up the training/building process, there should be an occasional malfunction or accident occur between your troops/soldiers.', ""I absolutely love this game. It is essentially a skinned version of clash of clans, but I thing it does a much better job as far as game play. Clash forces players to either save a ridiculous amount of resources or buy gems in order to upgrade buildings and units. Star wars does a better job of balancing this. The amounts aren't as high and seem much more attainable, but players can buy crystals if they prefer to upgrade things quickly. I play this game daily and enjoy every bit of it."", 'I have a suggestion for the game, a pretty small one to be honest. Instead of taking all of your soldiers after a battle, why not make a medbay or a repair garage and keep the soldiers and vehicles that survived like all the other games that have the same gameplay as this. In other words this is a very good game and I would suggest this to a handfull of friends, but that small ittle detail just gets me a little bit fustrated.', 'Every aspect of the game is fine besides for the amount of new and better content. There should be more of a variety of bases because when maxed out, it is just gold and gold. There should also be more troops to use. There should be special upgrades to armor and weapons to make troops better. Also, it would be cool to have a Mandalorian mercenary', ""The concept is amazing. But I am giving it 3 stars (for now) because it can use a LOT of improvements. 1. The most important one for me is that I am not able to connect with my friends and see anyone who plays it via facebook. I know a few friends who play this and they are on facebook. We tried to connect with facebook but we just cannot see each others accounts. I actually even know what the bug is. 2. I would love it if I got to play both sides. Because I just can't pick one. 3. It would be helpful if I could select a few walls and upgrade them together. 4. Sometimes the game just slows down."", ""Pay to Play: This game is basically unplayable past level 3 unless you are willing to drop serious cash into it, feels bad. You have to wait 24+ hours to upgrade buildings in some cases. Could be a fun game if the economy didn't try to bleed every penny from its users. With so many entertainment options available this game isn't worth your time or money."", 'I m having a blast im obsessed ill being playing this game for a long time. You can join friends and do squad battles or send troops to each other. You can play as rebels or the empire. Its a cool time killer when your not home or fun at home while watching tv. Its got a fun campaign also. Should give it a try its a good game star wars fans should play no matter what. Other people should give it a try. Graphics are cool gameplay is fun.', 'I love this game I been playing this for two years but thir is one con to it it takes so long to upgrade building but it all worth it at the end. And it reminds me about how you suppose to have sertant rank to get access to something anyway I want to this game all the support I can give. If your a developer of this game thank you for making this.', ""This game is incredible to play in terms of gameplay, although there is a couple downsides.. it's pretty difficult to edit your base considering the smallest buildings take up too much room aswell as everything else. (You'll know what I mean if you play it long enough) the second downside is the time limited attacks, most games like this of course are time limited when attacking other bases or single player campaign, but only get 1min 30sec to attack. Need to give more time for attacks."", ""1. Please add slots to save training queues, it's so annoying to fulfill spaceports after each battle. The idea of stored presets is so easy and obvious. 2. The same about base layouts. We need at least 3 presets to use during dayly activities. One for heroic defense, another for rival defenses. One more for wars. It's so obvious, again. - Minus 1 star for each point ;)"", 'Units are way to expensive. And buffers are extremely long. Game needs to be rebalanced. The game itself is buggy as hell. Not to mention every time I open threw game it takes forever to load and the lock out screen times out when I unlock it restarts the game. Complete garbage. Rushed through production. Rushed through release. Left alone with all its issues.', 'The only thing keeping my 5 star away from this game is how poorly optimized every screen transition is. Invariably, open your barracks? 10 second freeze before the training page. Use the arrows to scroll to your factory from the same screen? 10 second delay. Want to hit play and attack? Few seconds. Want to access your crates and unit samples? You guessed it. I spend more time transitioning between screens than I do training troops and attacking. Could be a great SW basebuilder otherwise. Rip', ""It's a good game but i think the time it takes to upgrade is a bit ridiculous. I get that you can spend Crystal's but they are very hard to get like you only get 20 or 30 a month just wish it was a bit faster but the battles and construction of the base and moving planets is Brill 8/10"", 'I really enjoy this game, although I find that it is slightly held back by what I consider to be a few balance issues. In my opinion, the time given for attacks is not long enough, especially becoming worse as you progress. Additionally, I believe some buildings begin to take too long to upgrade rather suddenly around base level 4 or 5. Other than this and more minor issues, this game is very fun and interesting to play.', 'I play this about a year ago and I put in 3-4 MONTHS of progress and I loved it. This is a fun game for what it is. But one day I loved on and an error happened and ALL of my progress was GONE have a year gone in one day. So I warn you 1 day all your stuff might be gone. I will give it another chance and see how it goes.', ""I've spent about $75 on this game. The defects just gets worse as you progress.... It's Star Wars, so it's gotta be fun! But the game loads slow and reloads everytime you leave to check your email or chat. And another thing that really really annoys me... I have in-game sounds and music on silent, but everytime the game reloads, the lightsaber sound goes off! I wish it was better, but there's just too many good games out there to continue playing and hoping that the programmers will fix it."", 'Strategy games has been a fav of mine but my oh my star wars tales it to a whole new level. Giving it my best strategy of the moment. More of the same. To infinite and beyond!!! I guess you could add an open space feature were you get to travel round the galaxy fighting on diff planets and also make the bad guys easier to kill, nothing bores a game more than having to try to kill bad guys for a long time. Cheerio.', 'The game is solid, but I have a few minor gripes. The troops tend to attack walls unnecessarily, there should be an option to play two separate builds light/dark side (admittedly, I\'m not done with the story, and the ""paid"" currency is VERY infrequent. I have no problem paying for a game I enjoy, but these issues make it hard to want to continue.', ""It was fun when I first started playing. However, as I progressed further, I noticed a few things that ruined continuous playability for me. First, building/ training times. It's ridiculous that I have to wait up to 24 hours for 1 barrack to complete an upgrade or a platoon of troopers to be battle ready. I considered using crystals to bypass the waiting time, but that option requires a lot of crystals. I spend most of my time waiting rather than playing."", ""Great game. Good story. The game never gets boring. When you loose a defense, unlike other similar games ( Boom Beach), you don't loose everything. Upgrades are streamlined and easy. I got easily addicted to this game"", 'The EP needed for quest play is ridiculously long high for elite crates. Rebels get weak troops and the Empire is way powerful. War matchs are lopsided to Empires favor matching 9 to 11 Prestige Empire against 2 to 4 Rebels Prestige. I have lvl 9 Rebel base been on great squads but always in the Empires advantage. I love the game and the play but started an Empire base due to the above. Glitches big problem no way to contact developers after lots of money on crystals just SOL', 'Unless you have hours each day to spend on this game don\'t waste your time. Good luck trying to get a foothold in anything. You\'ll be attacjed constantly and even when under a ""shield."" The only thing the developer says is that you should build up defenses and play more. Not worth the time. Seems like they are now just mining for your money to get further in the game. Very disappointed with how downhill this game has gone', ""I love this game so much been playing for years now, however the biggest gripe I have is Greedy Disney their are so busy trying to find ways to get as much money out of your pocket to play the game they over look how many times a day the game crashes So Sad. UPDATE : after leaving a poor review I've noticed I barely get attacked anymore when I log on it shows I'm being scouted, by whom? Then when I attack a base no matter the lvl I lose REALLY DISNEY ?? Wow beware ppl I'm getting an investigator"", ""I love this game. It's similar to clash of clans but it's also very different in gameplay and design . The bad thing is that some upgrades go up in cost way too fast but that's just me being picky. Other than that I would 10/10 recommend"", ""Purchased alot of crystals the in game currency and then all of a sudden my account diasapeared and they say it can't be recovered , and they are not willing to give me my crystals back as I accepted I have to start again , full on robbery and disgusting , support is like talking to a robot there are better games out there ."", ""I would personally recommend this game to teens and older people... It's quite easy to get resources without paying with gems or real money if your strategic with your forces in the Empire, something newbies & younger kids don't know about. Anyhow, You lost a star for using a flawed chat filter that censors non explicit words, minus another for losing my orginal data progress, and lost 2 stars due to the TX-225 on the Empire's side not crushing walls."", ""Things need to coast less. And to buy another drone. It shouldn't be 500. You can't save anything but credit and alloy. And when you try and save those things lol you can't because everything coast to much. You should be able to buy a drone with credit and alloy other than that it's pretty good. But if you would make those changes for us players and who don't have money to."", ""I like this game quite a bit, although I'm pretty bad at it (I'm not the best tactician out there,) more often than not I rely on sheer numbers alone to overwhelm my opponent, which usually ends up either working perfectly or being a complete waist of resources, despite that I can't deny that this is a very solid game with decent graphics and fun gameplay."", 'This Game has been an application since 2013 since this time it has undergone alot of updates and changes. The game is relatively based off of how much you play it and the more you play it the harder the competitors get. It is also pretty squad based which revolves around other competitors giving their resources and time for another squad member. Which kind of brings out the social aspect of it as well. It a time based stratgey game that relys on placement and it takes too much time to play.', ""Waiting too long for things to upgrade. When upgrading a couple things it took 5 days too upgrade. While waiting for this to happen I downloaded a couple other games and lost interest in this one. Anytime it takes an hour to upgrade something or longer. I end up closing it and playing another one in which doesn't take forever to upgrade a headquarters should not take an hour to do. This why I haven't logged on in a couple weeks. What is the point"", 'Very fun to play. Lots of options for strategy, and for and base and troop placement. Very balanced where new players are matched to similar players so that even after starting several years after the game has been out you can still be competitive.', ""Good for a few days, then I realised it's so repetitive: attack a base, defend a base, attack a base, blah-blah-blah.The actual gameplay needs much more variety. Also, there's insane waits for stuff to upgrade, a baffling squad system, and after all this time spent upgrading the HQ and factory I'm still stuck with the basic model of vehicles. There's no incentive for me to continue investing time in this game. Bye!"", 'Initially this game is a lot of fun, then the wait times to upgrade get ridiculous. You’ll have to wait at least 24 hours to upgrade one building, while getting attacked by players many levels above you so there is no hope for defense. It is obvious this is a cash cow for Disney since crystals are the only way to upgrade faster, otherwise you just let the games sit on a shelf for days on end for upgrades to occur. The more you attack, the stronger the base as you get match so there’s never any hope for getting anywhere fast.', 'Alright, been playing for awhile, and this game does deserve more then 5 stars. But i have some requests for the developer. 1st, for the base layout, could you do an update where we can have multiple layouts? As well as be able to copy your home base layout to the war base layout in an update please.', ""Lots of fun but... the text is so tiny on my phone. I'm installing on my tablet to see if it's easier to play. My phone has a 5.8 in screen so it's not small by any means but very hard to read this game on it."", ""Base building mobile games are a dime a dozen. This one is entirely average, but star wars themed. Loot boxes and events to unlock special things abound. Feels slow at level 6. Not sure how active the playerbase is as I've not been attacked. You can be either empire or rebels. Functionally identical although empire asthetic is obviously superior. Kind of slow to load and sluggish to open menus or production screens."", ""Game is good... Main problem, you save for Troops, build troops start a mission then once it starts the game crash's you lose all your troops including the money spent building and have to start again.. this happens all the time.,......... Sort it out!!"", ""Overall I love this Game, I've been looking for a star Wars game like this one and now it's here. I really do wish there was a clone wars Version where you got to side with either the sepritists or the Republic but I'll just have to hope that'll one day be a thing. Great game, good controls, love the designs of the units and turrents, and great music choices for both sides. Great game""]"

I do have one problem, before it worked perfectly, but now after every battle BTD Battles crashes. The game is still awesome though and its almost worth having to restart the game every time I finish a battle. Also, a lot of people are saying that when you start you go against really hard players, I started a new account and I kept a 100% win streak for a while with just a couple bad towers, just rely on 4th tower.', 'I\'ve been playing for over a year now and I say playing against other people is a good way to make friends also with the chat thing with the faces and words like ""good luck"" or ""late game"" can tell the other players that they want to go late game or telling then like good luck could mean he or she\'s not going easy on you but overall I think this is a really good game also with the membership that makes it more fun overall u should check it out. 👍👍👍👍', ""Really fun game, but can you just add more towers? That would make the game way more fun because you don't need to use the same towers over and over again. Also, can you add assault mode practice and cars battle practice? Thanks. And don't listen to the people who complain about the game. All their problems are about disconnecting, which is obviously because of their phone or their WiFi, or about the Ads, which is their primary way of making money since many people don't buy in-game purchases."", ""This game is really fun! You get to battle other real players, make friends, join clans, and much more! You get to progress your way up by beating other people in games and unlock other towers and their tiers, you can even compete! Not only its very fun and competitive, it's also challenging! You dont need to pay a single dollar to be the best, you just need skill. I highly recommend downloading this fun tower defense game, you will have all sorts of fun."", ""The game is pretty well made. I've been a fan of BTD for a long time and enjoy their games. But there is a huge flaw in this one. Heli is WAY too OP. Apache is way too broken late game. 4th towers should have never been a thing because it is just luck based. Someone could be running the same comp as you and they could have a better 4th and they will win because of that. That is unfair. Other than that the game is good. Just annoying how everyone rushes regen rainbow every match."", 'I like to play and compete but if you disconnect me and cost me a win for a forced ad to play..im not watching it and i will exit out of the game..if i have to take a phone call for business i cant get out without fighting the ads. I stopped watching them and exit the game now. Thank you for making the game..i do enjoy it but i could do without that part of it. Dont tell me to buy to remove them either.', ""Love everything about the game just one problem. If u don't pay for premium so u can't play the gold game modes more then once every 8 hours or so u should make it to where if your opponent disconnects u should be able to still play a gold game mode without having to wait another 8 hours to play it again. That's all I see wrong"", ""Awesome game but I went to use my limited premium access for the day joined a game and immediately the opponent left and I lost my pass. Why did I not get to play another game if I did not get to even play that one. I try to play bv the game to have fun not to win. I did not get a replay of the match. Thank you for responding. I'm changing my review back because I made this review when it just happened and I was really angry."", ""A fine game with many of the expected issues a game with such a huge playerbase would end up with. Thankfully it doesn't rely on in app purchases to make it enjoyable and it's easy to progress if you get into it. On the software side of things all seems to be okay with the UI being intuitive and user friendly (if a little dated and cartoonish) and all functions work without major issues. That being said it does not fit the aspect ratio of new phones including the new Xperias, this needs fixing ☹"", ""This game is great. Most of the game is obtainable without spending money. Don't waste your money on medallions because you can just join a good clan and you get thousands for playing for at least a week. Joining the 'club' is a extension to the gameplay and might consider getting it because I absolutely love the game."", ""Bloons TD Battles A fun game, yes, but the matchmaking is a bit unfait, I(a pretty trash player) am constantly getting matched against much higher ranking players than myself Else, the game is great, it's a little grindy at first to unlock all the towers, but afterwards it's just fun. Please NinjaKiwi, make like a $3 club access only, because I want the access but I don't want to pay extra for medallions in the offer."", ""I enjoy this game but from time to time I notice that I have won by watching the number but then it holds off till I lose. My last game seemed off. My opponent only had 2 lives left i had 150. I sent some balloons as others were coming through. My opponent also sent alot, but I watched more than 2 clear and it I still lost. I'm not a bad loser but thought u would want to know."", 'Game is great except it is decided who will win prior to the game even starting. Many games I have lost using the same exact technique that has won me many games. I just lost a game where he somehow destroyed 20+ of the strongest moabs with 1 low level monkey god tower and a few other monkeys. I have been killed with more towers and less moabs thrown at me . Really discouraging that some games you find out you never had a chance.', ""Bloons TD battles has the potential to be an incredible game, but it refuses to be just that. At the end of every game you play, you receive an annoying advert, and sometimes when you start up the game. It's the first game I haven't spent money on and I'm so glad I didn't. In terms of gameplay, you will immediately be punished for being new by coming up against super strong powers that you can't possibly beat with your tier 0 powers. Needs a huge fix if it's going to earn any more money."", ""It's a great game I have to say I've been playing it for years and love it but have I have to give it three stars because lately I've been have trouble with this game It keeps telling me that I'm disconnected when I'm not and have to exit and re-enter the app and it's annoying. Can you please fix this problem kiwi ninja. Thanks"", ""Great game! But you need to pay attention to the game a little more. I don't see anyone using different stratigies they are just using the same powers, same towers and same rushes mainly because the things there using are insainly overpowered. This makes pro players bored of defending the same rush and begginers constantly losing to the exact same rush because for some reason these people using the exact same loadout play on yellow stadium. Overall, the game is great just look after it more."", ""The game has so much potential, but it sucks that most matches only end at around round 20. It's too easy to win, just send a red moab then it's done. Perhaps make the cost of sending moabs at a much expensive price or prohibit sending moabs until round 30 or something cuz I think the game would be much more fun if matches would last longer. Another thing is also the powerups, too OP. There wasn't a single time I wouldn't be able to play against someone with 3000+ medallions."", ""This is a really good game. The app runs very smoothly and the game, being in the online strategy category, is well rounded, never leaving you bored or unsatisfied (unless you're afraid of competition and/or suck at tower defence games). Even then, it's still worth playing. Happy to have found it, thank you to the developers/producers. 👏👏👏"", ""The game is the best I've ever played. I haven't uninstalled it like all the other games because it's just so addictive. You get to earn medallions and have new scores. It's hard to pry it away. I just wish we could actually say what we want to say and search for usernames somewhere and if they're online, we could have a battle. (That is mainly the purpose so I can play with my friend.) I don't think I'll ever get old of it but I do wish we could see what percentage we really have. That's it."", ""I would like to say I absolutely love this game, but it needs fixed. Cobra absolutely needs to be scrapped. Its basically cheating if your opponent can take your lives even if you have a 10x better defense. Rushes are extremely easy and powerful. As long as you have a couple thousand coins you can all-out rainbow regen rush your opponent, it's full proof with hardly any way to defend. Powers need to be needed too, stunning the enemy's towers have nothing to do with skill or defense."", ""This game has alot of potential and is hands down one of the best games on the market !,but the bug needs FIXED badly where you load onto a lobby and your internet connection disconnects and you forfeit the match loosing what ever the wager was which in my eyes isn't very fair but in my case I disconnect for litterally 3 seconds and I've just lost a small fortune other than that all I would ask is more towers be added to the game"", ""I love this game. This is the only game I've played today. I watched youtubers play this a lot and I've played it a lot too. I love that you can just keep playing and playing over and over again without having to spend medallions on fights. The only thing I don't like is that you have to have club to play bananza or r3 speed bananza. I don't care about the other club required game modes but I just would love to play bananza or r3 speed bananza. Other than that it's amazing! Great job!😀👍"", ""A very addictive game, however I've been having a problem when maybe once a week I get a black screen when I'm trying to load up the game and it doesn't go away till a delete the game and wait till the next day. Everything else is perfect though, well done Ninja Kiwi. Update: I have lost my game data on my old account and I'm very confused as I had it linked to my google play account. I also bought club access for that account and I really need help right now."", ""Love this game! Enjoying it with my friends! Will you please add other social networks other than facebook? Like, twitter and LINE? So I can invite my friends easily. And when will the new towers or powers come? Add a lot of towers or powers so the game will not be boring time by time. Is there any languages other than english? My friend is Japanese and he don't really understand the game. I'm just teaching him how to play it. I hope this game will be better and popular in the future!"", 'Weekly leader board popup has ""try again"" button but no ""X"" to close it what kinda bull is that? Force me to close and reopen my app for lack of a button on a forced popup i dont care about, and what the hell is with settings menu having same trophie list as the trophy list button? Settings menu in general lacking on anything but sound, like where is the power saving low graphics button? Good game still hacked together in some places like not having assault practice and only defence practice.', ""I like the game itself, and I like the fact you could play the club despite the fact that you are not a member. One thing though, I don't like the fact you have to wait and buy towers. You have to play a lot of games before you can get things like the submarine. On top of that, you have to buy upgrades like the robo monkey. You wait until you have enough medallions and then, spend them all. Otherwise, a great game."", ""Great game, very fun and could play for days, it's fun but not too competitive, but if wanted to play competitively you can. the only thing I don't like is if theres a balloon like a ceramic it only deals 8 damage, but if it breaks then goes in it's instant game over. only complaint though."", ""I love this game and I've been playing for years. I had all towers unlocked at the fullest levels. I'm quite seasoned at this game. But, I logged back in and it reset all my towers. I don't have all the ones I bought plus I'm missing all my data. My coins are that thankfully still there however they can't get me my tower levels back. I just need help getting them back and I don't know what to do."", ""Honestly this game is great. No matter how many times I delete it I always end up coming back to it. Don't listen to the other bad reviews, because most of them are just people complaining and being picky about how challenging the game is. What I love most about the game is how different each individual match is. It feel like all new experiences."", ""Wow! this game is Amazing! It's fun and addicting. It's also quite simple when you have specific towers but I gave my review 4 stars because it does have slight bugs such as today, I came on and it doesn't go off 8h 0m so that's the only thing that gets me about this game"", 'I really hate this. I was going to play bannaza as soon as I started the game they told me ""disconnected "" and I had to wait 11 hours to play it again it happened again I will .. I raged and deleted the game and I will never download it again until something happens here is my name by the way: Mazen. With 16611 trophies..... I hate this soooooo bad', ""I like it its pretty good it never gets old. It gets addicting when you play a lot and challenging cause the rounds get harder and harder. I like this game cause there is different strategies you could use. This game entertains me , ecspesially when Youtubers play it. I enjoy this game a lot it's fun it's also you need some IQ to pass some levels. You could get addicted easily I really enjoy it even streamers play it a lot of famous gamers play it and that shows that this is a actual good game."", ""It's a fun game overall but big improvement: THEY NEED TO CAP BATTLE ARENA. For example, the very first arena is using only 5 medallions (basically trophies). A 40 medallion player shouldn't be going against a 1500 medallion player. It isn't fair. The game needs to cap the first arena to say 200 so beginners have an easier time advancing."", 'This game is EXTREMELY AMAZING, I love that you go on special arenas every day. (My favourite being boosty bananza fire) My favourite round is round 43 cuz u get to see the Z.O.M.G (zepplin of mighty destruction) and my favourite tower is the helicopter. I would give this game 50 stars if I could but instead 5. If you are new to this game the balloon types are:red,blue,green, yellow, pink, black or white, zebra, rainbow, ceramic, then, the Moab, Bfb and Zomg. The other are metal regrow and camo.', ""OMG where to start, I love love love this game, my cousin had recommend me to play it so I started and I didn't really get it at first but me and him have become like extremely addicted to it and I love that there are so many different characters and stuff, one thing I would recommend tho, is that when competing against friends that you could get rewards if u win still oh and that the competition things didn't cost money lol but overall best game EVERR ✌️👏👏👏👏👏"", ""The bloons feel is there, but enjoyment of the game is locked away by an oppressive monkey farm meta. Every person who plays this game seriously uses the exact same strategy and it seems the development team doesn't plan on doing anything to balance things out. If you are looking for a fun, chill game to play, this is far from it."", ""This game was one of the best strategy and tower games I've played. And I played a lot of strategy or tower games and this is definitely in my top 3 best tower defense and strategy games I've ever played with many upgrades and a good amount of tower selections, Bloons TD Battles, definitely top 3 in my list."", ""You NEED the sign in to give the option of, which game profile are you using, not go straight to dominant profile. Epic game, 5 stars 100%, but I could not find a work around without having to delete the dominant profile, and it shouldn't have to come to that, Every, Time, we want to change profiles... Especially when we have two devices both with same dominant profile, one is active online, and other can not even access the game unless the data is cleared Twice, because auto log dominant...."", 'This game is good but I still have on complaint that I am not sure that is the games fault or my phones but when I do those quest to other apps for 🎖it just shows a white screen, like I said this game is awesome but I just had to ask if this is happening to other people or is it just my crappy phone', ""From 5 stars to 2 stars, this game has one of the worst connectivity issues there ever is. Even if i've got a fast internet connection, whenever entering matches- i always get disconnected. I always try opening google or stream something on youtube to check if it's my internet who's got a problem or not, but no...it's always the game itself and i'd rather play something else rather than getting random disconnection notices.""]"

The gameplay is simple and addicting but on a limited time and attention. However, it's still fun with the urge to unlock the next ship. Controls? Tablet/smart phone controls are way better than on PC/Laptop. But keep it up devs! It's a recommendation for me."", ""Fantastic space sim. I've played similar games, but this one is probably one of the best of its kind. Smooth, smart and built for casual and hardcore gamers alike. It's surprisingly addictive with a lot of customization features and superb art design and direction. 10/10"", ""Love playing Battleship s*** playing space battleships love adding new guns airplanes and stuff to it making them upgrade. This is a great game. I think anybody who wants to start first playing Battleship like this. She like it. Don't get him. Keep it up guys do one that's free though. Like absolutely free. For the people who don't have the money."", 'I really enjoyed the game as far as playing and options, but the amount of time it takes to earn the ships is insane. I am an adult with a job and do not have that kind of time to work on that ship list one at a time. I woul not reccomend buying this unless you can save up for the ship you want. Fun at first, but then turned into a painful grind.', 'Personally really really enjoyed the game, defo got my money worth. Drawback is probably no other modes available, limited to 3 ships and takes a while to unlock new ones, however from my understanding the developer had to focus attention elsewhere to avoid bankruptcy.', 'Been playing this game since 2016, it never disappoints. I would like a way to craft high end weapons and ships (or improve shielding/Hull) because there is always a point in the game when it is impossible to kill before being killed.', ""Great little game, had me hooked. The game play loop wasn't too bad and there could be more variation with the weapons and how they perform, but overall a great purchase."", 'Worst game ever experienced. Starting battles are impossible with no apparent way to upgrade your ship or earn resources or experience in order to get strong enough to do so. Difficult can be fun, but not as much when you first start. Edit: nice try devs. i started the game dozens of times. i tried out every one of the turrets available with the starting credits. offensive turrets, shield emmitters, fighters, and even purchasing the wingman vessels in different variants for extra fighters or just shooty escorts. the first few enemies still wipe the floor with the player ship or ships, usually in seconds. the one time i managed to win the first fight, the reward in resources made what is generally called ""a pittance"" look like riches. i\'ve been looking for years for a spaceship game where i start with a ship, upgrade it, enhance it, fly around, and then work towards a bigger better ship to fly. i thought this might be it, but i was wrong and my search continues...', 'I cannot wait for the release of space haven, thus why im replaying this game although it does eventually get repetitive, its still fun discovering tactics to take out the worst of enemies', 'Almost got in on the kickstarter when it was called FTL, actually got it years later because the concept sounded cool, and it is a cool little game, like a simpler space version of nethack.', ""Very impressive first look. Mechanics of ships are good. Good for short play times. Needs improvement on tutorial. May be difficult at start. Lacks replayability. Farming to win with little to no strategy once you've figured out the game."", ""It's a great game, the best battlevoid game so far! I have no complaints and it definitely deserves five stars"", 'This is the best game of battlevoid verse pls update it more frequently and add some more levels and sandbox mode where we can have 5 or 6 ships and thanks.', ""Good games, good reply value, but and that's a big but, the difficulty level is very high, Normal is very hard. Clearly the difficulty level is there to stretch the length of the game."", ""this is a fun time killer, the only thing that bothers me is the fact you CANNOT carry over your fleet from one level to the next! What's up with that? That sucks! spend all the time to build your fleet only to have ripped away on the next level. Another thing way can't you bank your scrap in order to help build your ship up so you can fight the enemy. Thinking about uninstalling because hate having to start over and over again."", 'I am really enjoying this throwback to old school space games. This is not to easy and requires some thought and just enough strategy to add depth. Well worth the money.', ""Great game, well worth the money! I like the challenge level, keeps it interesting. I've read the other reviews, and have a notion that would solve most people's main gripe. (Mine too.) I'd like to see a way to save your progress, at least between maps on a level. It can get very frustrating to take the time to fight your way to the third or fourth map, then lose it all due to one unfortunate battle! And have to start all the way back at the begining again! C'mon guys!We're not paying quarters."", ""Annoying AF. You can get through 2-4 maps, no problem. But then, inevitably, you will hit a map that you clear until the last system, which will be crawling with enemy ships. Forget that you have 50,000 credits to spend, your HQ ship will get destroyed and you have to start over. And again, forget that you have 50,000 credits...advanced ships remain permanently locked. I guess this is supposed to be..what...strategically challenging? It isn't. It's just annoying. Sad. An otherwise beautiful game."", ""It's a really good game, worth the money. Lots of fun different play styles, but the only issue is the scoring. It sucks to have just filled your fleet with the best ship and gear available and to have very little scrap left, just to get merc'd and your score plumetting due to scoring being based mainly on scrap on death, how many places discovered, and what sector you're on. It's still a solid game, but it's very annoying to get further than a previous game by far, but get a score as if you died right off the bat... still worth the money though."", 'the game is good. however the enemy is a little overpowered. and as you progess thru the first 3 lvls, the ships you unlock cant even come close. random map creation can create black holes and asteroid fields for 2 to 3 tiles in a row. which is bad cause it disallows your fleet to repair. and if the enemy decides to follow. its game over real fast. which isnt cool at all. that needs to be fixed. actually give us a chance to survive.', 'At one point i found this game incredibly hard, but it was still enjoyable, am still waiting for the latest game to be released (space haven for those who dont know)', 'I really enjoyed this game. Pros: great replay value, ability to add different weapons to ships. Cons: while you can unlock a lot of ships, most are junk. ship control is minimal, and only exists to move you closer to the target. the only strategy is choosing what quadrant to warp into in each sector.', ""Great little space RTS that you can spend a few hours on over the course of a week here and there. It's a perfect pick up / put down strategy rogue that's a little hard at first but once you get into the swing can be very rewarding. If they ever make a sequel the only thing I'd add is some sort of ship power level controls for a little extra control and strategy. Otherwise it's a great game that doesn't have any Pay To Win function at all. Top stuff devs, I'll be watching out for Harbingers 2!"", 'What I think, I have completely earned every ship and I start over so many times cause I love it! I really love that new weapons and ships are incorporated and would love to see what comes next Still loving the game! 2019', ""Moving ship around is broken. Confirmation after every move is quite annoying. Fix it please, and you'll get higher rating. Edit: It seems that game has some bugs. Some can be ignored, but others are irritating. As for the above, one has to restart the game at least once to mitigate the problem with moving. Other, noticeable issues are vanishing items once there is more than 4 in one sector, or frozen ui with missing hud once I try to do two way barter with ship having all four slots full. Other than that, the game can be quite enjoyable."", ""really like this game, but this is the 4th time@ least it crashed and wiped out my progress. infuriating! 1st time up to 93+ experience, now can't get past 30+ something before it crashes. Come on! Probably my device, look 4 games similar, still looking. 👍👍 from me. my type of game. TY 4 response! 😋 happens again, just start again! LOL"", 'I can say that this is the best game but it requires some more options like 1.we want gatling drones which are more in numbers but less in hull 2.we want to be able to have more secondry (auto) guns like pin missiles,power battery for more speed etc. 3.and PVP battles', ""I love this game. It's like a mini squad based tactical strategy game, with mini skirmishes over an expansive universe. Upgrading, repairing and selecting your ships is a key to long term survival, and it's a blast. I've spent countless hours working on and adapting my strategy, and then changing it again when unlocking new ships. More than worth the price tag."", 'This is a tough game but replays with the progressed equipment smooths the difficulty curve, well implemented. While I always felt outnumbered, tactics make the difference.', ""love the game but i still feel its lacking. a more intricate story line and perhaps a multiplayer? also, repairing around the battle station should be automatic for all ships. it takes time to press individually. 3 ships seems sad for me, can i have 5? i also love the part that the game is one time purchase and u can do everything in game w/o further cash. makes me remember the good ol'days"", 'Great game, love the graphics, the weapons and turret systems reminds me of Homeword/PC but top down. It can be frustratingly difficult and a bit if a grind, you can die by making a single bad decision but something keeps me coming back for more. Since unlocking more ships i am enjoying the game a lot more and the higher lvl ships are awesome.', 'You take a 3 ship squad and travel the map completing basic missions over either 4 levels or unlimited with the values on weapons scaling up for as long as you can last. Gameplay consists of tap to go controls, auto fire turrets and strike craft. Ships range from corvette to battleship and carriers. theres an emphasis on positioning when jumping from sector to sector for both you and the enemy and anomolies to look out for. Great game.', 'Love the game ever since it first released. i know its been awhile but is there any chance of a possible uodate? i was thinking for the ships the require parts to unlock, perhaps change the fighters appearance to match that ship, maybe add a new fighter (boarding ship that can capture enemy ships) maybe a new ship/environments. As a huge fan, i will still continue to support your team and its games. keep up the great work. Looking forward to seeing what you guys have next. And thanks again. :3', ""This is similar to a FunOrb Game; but, definitely not the same as that FunOrb Game. The Tutorials don't cover most of the GUI Features; and, don't describe the game as Turn-Based with each Jump = 1 Turn. Need to repeat the Tutorials until Level-2 is attained; maybe, until Level-3 is attained. Playing the Game while Online causes Lag Issues; and, other problematic issues. Start-Up Resources fluxuates between Game Re-Starts; and, and the Random Start-Up Resource Numbers doesn't make sense."", 'This is a great idea, and I think you could do a lot with a foundation like this in a sequal game. Also, you would get a ton of traction if you could pull of a star trek/halo version of this. Brilliant as is, but could be used as a phenominal foundation for a game with more options and complexity to it.', ""Please keep adding variety to this game it's just awesome it's literally my kind of game I love RTS Games and this one blew it out of the water please keep adding SHIPS AND WEAPONS AND LOTS OF THEM!! Y'all are doing an amazing job with these games and I loved every one of them they have not disappointed and those are facts. and the part is I can play this offline which makes it my main game, please keep your future games playable offline. Thanks for the game!"", ""You guys really need to pay attention to the horrid pictures of the alien characters. I mean those pics are really, really, really STUPID. I'm sure that between all your skills as a game developer one of you could try a little bit harder to stretch that imagination. Good luck!"", ""Game is a lot of fun. Don't have that much time in it yet, my only issue I've run into is the controls. I sent one of my ships in a different direction from the main ship and then couldn't get that ship to sync up again. Otherwise, fun times were had."", 'After playing it on the tablet....purchased it on steam. I enjoy this relaxing challenge.....nice graphics as well. ✌', ""It's better now with the improved blueprint drop rate but progression on getting new ships still feels a bit grindy and not that enticing. Partly because the ships you get are just slightly better so there's not much motivation. Unlocking a variety of things like weapons or races for example should be considered.""]"

One of the best games I've ever played in google games. At least one with an interesting story. The story goes like a nice science fiction book.

The visuals are nice, the cutscenes are good but you can't progress in offline mode. The game HAS to be linked to the internet otherwise your buildings don't generate income.

I liked the hack mechanics, the way representing the info. It is really promissing game. I am at its very beginning, but all sound promissing and deep.', 'Awesome game great time burner', 'I really enjoy this game.

A perfect tower dense game for anyone! My only complaint though is that once you beat the campaign, you get to do elite levels, which reccomend 50 stars or more for each level. The campaign only gives you about 30 stars. So its almost impossible to progress without paying money, or building up a huge dimond stash for an eternity jist to beat one level! Make some bridge levels to help progress players forward.', ""I have one word , well maybe not one but more . 1 : I really love games like this because you have to plan your own stradegy ! 2 : I LOVE the characters and bosses and the levels and the abilities !! 3 : I don ' t know what else to say but AWESOME"", ""Enforced to use items to beat the special challenges of each map. So either spend hours to grind enough gems to buy a bunch of items to beat one challenge, or drop the buck. It is annoying, but otherwise decent game. I like the later ones more personally. The fact that you can't at least use your hero for those special challenges in this one, makes it too hard in my opinion."", 'Fantastic game, THE best tower defense in the market i think and completely different from the bloons series. Set in a fantasy setting you take on the role of a general leading an army of elite towers! And the easter eggs hidden throughout the game is just the icing on the cake. I have played this game since it came out on flash all those years ago and i still play it, always lovely to play and the rest of the series is equally good.', ""One of the best TD I have played, I like the graphics, gameplay and the controls, I'm really enjoying this. The only bad thing in this game is that eventually you'll get to the point when you've completed all levels, upgraded everything, get all the heroes etc., meaning, there will be nothing left but the endless challenge. And that you would eventually become bored at some point."", ""Nearly unplayable on newer phones. If the application loses focus, it freezes. This is incredibly frustrating, especially when it's so easy to make the switch applications gestures, which is enough to kill it and lose all progress. Look for a dev update on this one. The gameplay seems good. Microtransactions haven't been an issue an hour or two in on the hardest setting, but I expect to hit the microtransaction roadblock at some point. I'm hoping for paid version without microtrans."", 'It was my computer game of choice during middle school for a reason. A really fun tower defense game with modifiable difficulty, making it the perfect game for all sorts of people. I\'d wish it didn\'t quit the current match when you switch tabs, but what can you do. Tapping the ""start wave"" button is a bit of a hassle too.', ""I saw some of the reviews and wanted to say, if you couldn't listen to music while playing, try pessing the pause button when in game then off the music of this game, then start plying your own music. It works for me."", ""It's FREE, and offers what feels like a very fine tuned tower defense experience that offers variety and challenge, coupled with the fun addition of the player controlled heroes to help cover weak points and mix things up in the gameplay. Once I've started, it was hard to stop until the end. The payable extra hero classes are surely fun and powerful, but you absolutely do not require them to beat any level, difficulty, or challenge. You just need wits and determination (and a guide sometimes..)"", ""This is the cream of the crop when it comes to mobile games. It's fun, addicting, and doesn't shove ads in your face constantly. The strategy here is to create different types of soldiers to halt the enemy waves advancement. It's a really nice to look at and fun game. Besides having to pay for some end game content this one's a keeper. Just a great game in a great series overall."", ""Very well made, with one HUGE flaw. I've been on a tower defense game kick recently and this is the best one I've found so far. But if you're playing and make the foolish mistake of pressin your device's home button (or any other that takes you out of the game) and try to go back in, the program freezes entirely. I can't imagine this Galaxy S10 would have any problem performance-wise and assume the error is within the game. It's ruined a few levels for me at this point. Otherwise, phenomenal."", ""I was looking around for tower defense games and i came across several one's that didn't fit the description. Until i found this. It's a simple yet attention grabbing tower defense game. It has several elements to it that keep things interesting & adjustable according to your strategy. It's offline so it saves battery and data unlike other tower defense games. I love the game and I've been playing for hours!"", ""Campaign was fun. 3* on everything. Then each map you click recommends 50 stars before playing and at only 36 total stars that are obtainable that's kinda hard to do! I beat some with just 36 stars. I'm frustrated. With less than 50 stars can't beat any of the levels on easy without paying. A feature rewarding you for beating easy then medium then hard would be nice. Or even a way to track what difficulty it was beat on. Too many enemies too. Wish there was a symbol for strengths of enemies."", ""When it comes to mobile td games, this is magnum opus. Great level design, huge variety of tower, enemy and level designs with a better upgrade system than most other competitors. It's easy enough to beat but to 100% it is what makes the replay ability increase. With 3 different difficulties and 2 challenge levels for EACH INDIVIDUAL LEVEL, plus an endless mode, it's hard to run out of things to do. Another nice thing is that there are no ads in any way, which really helps make it less scummy."", ""I'm enjoying playing the game. The levels are challenging which is good. Unfortunately the game crashes very easily. If you get a message or anything during a level, and you pause it to reply etc, it'll crash and you have to force it to close and restart it so you lose any progress in that level. It wouldn't be such a pain but the levels take a long time to play so it's likely you'll have an interruption at some point."", 'Very nice game, you can finish it without paying money just by strategy and skill. The bad side is that version of app is out of date and with partial support for Android 10. Game freezing, crushing and lock phone for no obvious reasons.', 'For someone having difficult after completing campaign (I assume you already has all 3 star), try to play heroic/iron challenge in last 5 campaign because its much easier than early campaign. Maximize meteor, arrow, magic and put some skill on your barrack then it will be gucci for you. Not paying anything, so far I already have 70 star since 3 days ago. I really like this game and will buying other series.', 'Highly recommended as it is one of the best TD games! This game can make you spend weeks or even a few months playing it Jam-packed with interesting and unique levels where each level features a new mechanic , new tower or annoying but reasonably tough enemies. There are in-app purchases for heroes but it is not necessary to beat the game At first it may be tough for beginners to grasp the gameplay but the game teaches you step by step with guidelines and ramps up the difficulty in every level.', 'Great game, very challenging, best part is no ads! Only issue is game freezes when you pause then try to go back to game after doing another activity on phone (text etc).. Stages are long so play it when you have at least 30 minutes free.', 'Brilliant game overall, but the amount of additional content that must be purchased is somewhat of a joke. The game is free to play but several heroes must be purchased additionally. I would happily pay £2 - £3 for the game and have all content available.', 'This game is great! But for some reason it just closes out on samsung. Maybe it is just my phone, but it would be great to fix it. I have all the other games and would love to play this one. Other then that I have played it elsewhere and it is amazing.', ""It has been the best game ever since it came out(I don't remember when it came out, if you could tell me that would be great), and I have played it for so many years, and I think that the other kingdom rush games should be free for others that love Ironhide games and you should continue to make more."", ""GREAT Game, don't get me wrong, but there's a pretty annoying issue that happens when you get a call, or accidentally leave the app, that crashes the game, and doesn't allow you to resume where you left off, forcing you to start over... This is extremely inconvenient when you're super far into a game."", 'It is an amazing game.I really love the level curve and how you progess,it gets a lot harder even if I am playing on easy mode it is still pretty challenging.Other than that this is probably one of the best games that Google Play has to offer.', ""I'm more of a hardcore/competetive type gamer. So I hate games where you never lose, or only lose once or twice in the later levels. That's one of the reasons this game deserves 5 stars. Not only do you get challenged from early on (hardest difficulty), you accualy have to think on how to beat the map."", ""I love this game, I played it all the way to completion. But then I encountered a bug where when I open the app, it immediately closes. I've tried to run it on 2 different devices but the issue still persists. I've sent 2 emails to support and gotten no response. I live this game and wish to play it, but still am unable to."", ""I love this game! The quirky animations, the sound effects, the slightly increasing complexity of the game as you progress. Everything! Man, I'd love for a whole universe of kingdom rush games. I've downloaded the other two and I'm having equal amount of fun. Kudos to the developers for making such an amazing game."", 'Over all its good but one thing tho... I Must buy hero to unlock it? Well its ok i clear all campaign mission Its quiet hard when no heroes (wich is in bonus mission). So yeah i hope you make another mission or daily challenge thats make the rule tower ability is random. Thats all Thanks.', ""The game was fun and well balanced. No mandatory adds is also huge in my books. Giving it 3 stars for app performance. The game is not optimized, or at least not for newer OS. Minimizing the app causes it to be unopenable and, it drains battery like there's no tomorrow."", ""Kingdom Rush last update was over 2 year ago, it was suppose to provide support for 18:9 ratio display, yet the game is still not optimized or even partially support full screen display on my Galaxy S8 and the game lack of cloud support. Developer claimed they are working on cloud support which I highly doubt it given it hasn't got any update in over 2 year."", ""Loved Kingdom Rush for ages, thought I should finally get it on mobile. It didn't dissapoint. The game is a blast to play. Only reason it's not 5 stars is because sometimes if i switch apps for just a minute and then go back to the game, it will close the app. Other than that, I love the app."", 'The game seems as if it were just a quick cash grab. The reaon is the game has four, very bland towers that have strengths and weaknesses with only one upgrade path, and to beat the game you have to pay. Other than those problems it is actually a pretty good game and pretty hard. (I like it when games get hard because i like a challenge)', ""Do not buy it the first levels are good but then you get this impossible level and i was so close to finishing it and i pause it to have lunch two thing happened 1.it restarted when I turned it off 2. I got really close again I stopped for dinner but this time I paused it but I had to tap the screen otherwise it will turn off but I accidently press restart and like most games usually when you press restart it says *Are you sure you want to restart* In This game that doesn't happen and i restart""]"

I got absolutely hooked with this game, the first time I played I spent the money to upgrade and got to the end way to quickly and so sad I finished. I uninstalled the game and reinstalled so I could enjoy it to the max without cheating with money.... Loving it better earning honestly :) You must give it a go. (I am 53) Quite challenging the second time around. Everyone needs a great time waster, this is perfect. Thank you Limbic.', 'The best ever, balanced and one can be genuinely creative with builds, too much tower defence dross out there, please, please please create a sequel or additional levels!', ""Really fun game but has reset me back to the beginning twice, without cause. It's really annoying to have almost beat every level and then have to start over, twice."", ""Really enjoyed the game, but there's no more suppert, they have stopped making updates or new maps for almost 5 years."", ""I have given only a solo star because though it's graphics is not bad, but in every level,UFO landing spots situate here and there, which will disturb your mind.l hope the developer should look into the matter."", 'A very good game with many different difficulties to choose from depending on what mood your in', 'I loved it , but problem Im facing is About Tesla Towers not hitting any Air incoming invasion. Its really sukkx ,, not able to finish the level just becuz that,,, Fix this Bug plz', 'Not loading last cleared maps, though It was logged in to google. Tried many times by playing 1 or 2 map but every time I uninstall and reinstall again, it starts from 0.', ""I used to play this game on my 2nd gen ipod touch. While not very good in retrospect, it's one of my favs. Also it is fun but just not that balanced but that's ok.. ok bye now.."", ""One of the best TD games I've played on my phone. It became a habit to start a game when i wasn't doing anything. Sadly, I maxed out all of the maps, and instinctively still start the game. Overall great game. You can tell it was well thought out. If your like me and love great tower defenses, pick this one up. Also, love the credits guys! Made me laugh."", ""I like the game but the harderblevels get you won't give enough money to start with i'v tried everything but can only get so fare so i'm done trying ! All you games want money but someone will come up with a truely free game (LOL)!"", 'I is a really fun game, however my only complaint is the money at the start and the cost of your towers is really bad. I wish you would get more money for your kills or they would drop yhe prices of towers and there upgrades.', 'Amazing. I want more games like this. Please add some more stages so that we can enjoy.', ""I'm pretty stingy with my reviews but this one was worth it.  I played it two times and am about to start my 3rd because other tower defense games seem boring.  Maybe its because they have no sheep or maybe its the timing and arsenal.  Either way this game rocks.  Please add more missions or just make a 3rd.  You don't even have to update the graphics. Just do all new maps and throw in a few new weapons.  Maybe nerf the rocket launchers though.  That seems to be the key to the game.  Then again, i'm going for 4 stars now!"", ""Excellent game. Only things I can think of to make it better would be: 1) make the flying ship a bit fire resistant 2)make it possible to restart with the towers set up as they were before you started the waves 3) the overheating isn't active in world 6 (intentional?) makes it to easy 4) nerf the missile launcher a bit"", 'The game is very good tbh. I would like a story for the game as it would be more fun to dive deeper into the game.', ""you know how you've been searching for a really good game and reading ppls comments to see if the game is worth installing. well, i find that TOWER MADNESS is a really good game. there's tower madness 1 and 2. If you consider yourself to be one of the Best players...here is your match, if you are good that is, if not keep on browsing..."", 'Great way to kill some time. This is a simple fun but very well.made little game of tower defence with nice graphics. You build towers to protect your sheep from the aliens and when you need to wait for money to build up (towers kill aliens to make money) or you have enough towers you can speed up and then slow down the game. Lots of little levels make it a great game to kill time on a commute or when your just sat waiting for something. I definitely recommend having this on your phone.', ""quite impressive excellent game. 4 stars instead of 5 because later rounds have too many waves. level takes too long and you end up just adding and upgrading towers non stop defeat the purpose of td games. also buggy at times when you can't add or upgrade. overall very nice. needs improvement."", ""So far so good. The only problem with the game is, it's too hard. On like the third map and it's really difficult. The difference between the previous map and this one is really big. Need to rebalance the game, maybe ramp up the towers a bit more. Thank you so much for this cool game!!! Bo"", 'alright game until you get to the level with the flying units. they should have to follow the trail, not fly right over you towers like nothing. kinda stupid there. have them follow the trail, but only your air towers can shoot at them. so far only thing that was not goid in the game. i am uninstalling this game for that reason. first wave of air troops went right over the top of my 15 air towers like nothing and they do it right at the start of your defense so only like 6 towers are shooting', 'Just started playing, but it feels similar enough to the first one to deserve 5 stars. Good mechanics and the fun goofy visuals. I love that you can pick if a tower attacks the first, last, or most powerful alien. I really wanted this feature in the original game.', ""This in my opinion is one of the Best tower games available. reasonably easy (at first), great variety of towers, and upgrades. Other than doubling currency (sheeps woll), there seems to be no pushed purchases. Mind you, it's very playable without purchasing double currency. Hats off to the Development team! 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟"", 'Fun game. Interesting strategy element enhances playability.', 'Just started playing and I love love love it.....do not be slow with updates and keep up the good work.........👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍', ""I played through TM2 a couple of years ago. It's probably one of the best tower defense games you can get on Android. I periodically check out new tower defense games (I have a problem) and there are some good, many bad, but this one shines through!"", 'This is excellent! I thought it was going to be too cartoony for my taste from the photos. But this is great!', ""Great game. Mix of Tower Defense and Puzzle game. Version 1 was better though. Wish they'd come out with v.3"", 'One of the best TDs out there, no joke. The subject matter is silly, but the mechanics are superior.', ""Easy interface and pretty well thought out. This is NOT pay to play, however I did spend some small amounts to increase my tower slots. Few ads. The best feature is the ability to change the aliens' path by syrategic placement of your towers. The most satisfying game of this type I have yet played."", ""games sets you up to fail. Buy or lose a lot untill you can afford the wool to upgrade your weapons. There isn't a strategist who will be successful on even the easiest settings without losing.

All this game needs is a little more mature looking graphics n' difficulty and it's a 5 star from me. otherwise a strong 4!!!!"", ""Still one of the top three tower defense games ever!

Love this game!"", ""It's the best game ever. Love the co-op mode because I'm able to play with my cousin and my family on a great and fun strategy game. Keep up the good work.

Other than that it's a game made by the gods"", ""Too expensive for a game with in app purchases and microtransactions. The game itself is fine but the expensive microtransactions for skins, in-game currency, and permanent buffs make me feel like i'm playing a free to play game.

You get forced to lose.', ""Special agents only count for 1/10th of their pops tward daily challenges which makes no sence at all. Special agents have been nerfed so they do less of what they used to do such as the blood berry bush doesn't spread anymore and the super moneys agents don't pop everything or even all the balloons on the maps anymore.

I'm giving this game 4 stars for now, let's see what makes me bring it to five."", ""This tower defense game is filled with a basic story, a fun tower defense gameplay, and zombies! This game is available on both PC and mobile. However, the mobile version offers an unfair advantage vs the PC version. By this, I mean that you can watch ads to double your rewards. But I'm not gonna lie, you should play this game if you like zombies, tower defense, zombies, and a bunch of good game mechanics! But I honestly think that we need more games like this, because there it is that good."", 'All good, great even, until I try to double my rewards and the adds bug out, other than that, everything is very good, a variety of troops to deploy, tower defense mechanics mixed with a bit of RTS makes the game detach from the standard TDs, giving endless possibilities of strategies, I would add an upgrade to be able to purchase deployment points for more troops since you can have up to a maximum of 32 units', ""It's a great game, and interesting. Infact I love playing this game and I do not have much to say .and why I gave it four star it's because the game is not that lovely but sometimes not that amazing, like brave knight, shadow fight, zombies shooter, and most importantly it does not have a great shooting. But the is great just try it your self. And u will see what I mean."", ""This is a great game, plenty of upgrade options, and you don't have to pay, not over the top with adds like most games. I would however like to see a bit more added in the way of defenders and towers as I have a shed load of cash now with nothing to upgrade. Overall I highly recommend it defense strategy games are your thing."", ""Ad infested game. After each 2 minute mission, there's a mandatory ad and an optional ad. There's also ads in game for benefits. The ui also leaves a lot to be desired, would be acceptable ftphad the game not been diseased with mandatory 30 seconds ads. I don't like writing negative reviews as I know developers do good work and don't have any input on the sales model, but based on the crazy amount of 5 star reviews, I can't fathom why. Gameplay is lacking, graphics are mediocre, ui is bland."", 'Great game but I think you should get money even if you ""fail"" a mission cause I made it to round 40 something on one mission just to see how far I could get and when I eventually did lose I got nothing from it and I just wasted 30 minutes', ""Doesn't seem to cheat for grind. Good leveling. Fun fun fun! Even the ads at the end of every level, it doubles your winnings and only takes about 30 seconds quite worth it.

Love to give 5 stars (come dev you can do it).', 'This game was fun to play. I was able to upgrade everything quickly and complete the normal and nightmare level. I wish there was more to upgrade but overall it was a fun game. Time to find a new game.', 'Overall a solid game. You can also do offers to get in game currency so you can get some great upgrades.

Only noticed 2 issues: 1 when you are trying to upgrade a troop if there is an icon behind it in game it also interacts with it at the same time. 2 the premium upgrades are blocked where you connot use the same in game currency you use to unlock regular and gold upgrades. Must spend money for each upgrade. Please fix this. Great job developing this game.', ""Really poor experience. You MUST make the tutorial better. The tutoral guides you to select a green circle, with no unit available immediately to put in. Make it VERY clear what you're supposed to do. Get your UI, throw it in the trash, then try again. You COULD have a decent game, but right now, It's not worth the space on my phone."", ""Explode 'em all game, tactical opportunities are unlimited, upgrades are very fun to experienc and easy to obtain.

You can buy things if you want but you really don't have to. Recommended if you have some free time..."", 'I want to enjoy it, but likes shutting off after a minute of play. Very frustrating', ""The game has its flaws, from the multitude of abusable molotov bugs to the inability to unrender off-screen effects which causes a lot of severe fps drops and occassional crashes. Nonetheless, this is a down-and-dirty zombie defense game that's one hell of a throwback to the browser game days. I hope you guys make a sequel, and please do it on Unity or something so it's not nearly as broken as the current game. xD"", ""I gotta be honest with you guys, I have never ever seen worse UI in my entire life, it worse than I thought was possible, but other than that it's a decent game, to bad the UI makes it almost unplayable, so please fix that."", ""Hello you've make a super cool game! But i have 2 suggestion to you, are you going to add an npc tank as an upgrade? And oh can you change the npc that fire's the apc autocannons? Its awkward that three terminators are using it to fight zombie maybe replace them with tank crew members or something thats all overall the game is cool and great thank you!"", ""Giving it 3 Stars cause it's a Overall Fun Game with Lots of Content to keep you occupied for Hours.

The main irritating bit I remember is if a mission you're retrying has dialogue, you have to run through it all, every retry. Minor annoyance, but easily fixed! Also, probably intentional, but things are somewhat randomized, so that you can play the same mission, in the same exact way, and have very different results!"", ""In fact, this game isn't playable at all or isn't free. Not enough resources to finish even the tutorial mission, without buying an upgrade pack. Need to move it to the paid games or give enough resources to make possible to play it without buying any upgrades, because its a cheating. Therefore giving just one star. The graphics and controls are good."", 'The game is fun, although the towers seem to attack a random target within range, because I had my tower at the end of the map and it didnt attack the monsters whom were destroying the ""light bulb"" yet it seemed to be attacking random targets. Why?', 'Best mobile game ever. Haxage you guys are amazing. The visuals are stunning - love the sound also - the gameplay is challenging but the reward is worth it, nothing is more fun than when my arsenal of weapons destroy all those aliens. A must play for every one. *****', 'Really good game,good graphics and soundtrack but i feel like it sort of raises its difficulty a bit too much at some points therefore making you buy the premium stuff buut it doesnt force you to do so, it just makes things a bit more difficult if your a f2p player.', ""This is one of the hardest tower defense games I've ever played. You'd need to spend money on the packs just to beat levels. They are super hard or difficult to beat. Unless you are willing to spend money on this game, don't get it."", 'The turret does NOT shoot the target that has traveled the farthest which EVERY tower defense should be. It makes zero sense that the turret randomly decides to shoot enemies in the middle of the pack.', ""WOW this game had so much potential. The art is charming, the dialogue is hilarious, and I had so much fun at first. But even in the second and third levels, they'll throw ridiculously impossible waves to defeat that are only weak to weapons in the purchase packs. There isn't a difficulty curve, there's a difficulty CLIFF. And I haven't been playing long enough to justify throwing money at it. I'd hate to think that the only reason I'm passing levels is because MONEY."", 'Excellent tower defence game, one of the best I ever played. Beautiful graphics, mezmerizing! Great gameplay, physics, mechanics, and smooth controls. Play at night in the dark for the best experience.', 'Most of the levels are next to, if not impossible to beat without buying several packs within the games, even the characters try to get you to spend money on this game.', ""I was able to brute force most of the levels people here are complaining were too difficult without paying (e.g. mission 12), but their point still stands that if you don't pay for better equipment/towers then the game will either be too difficult to be fun, or very grindy and trial-and-error based. I did enjoy all the levels that got difficulty right (read: were fair), though, and the graphics are wonderful."", 'What the heck? Starting from Monsters Ante Portas, the game already becomes very hard to beat. This game is pay-2-win with all those cool weapons (which may be very effective) are not available unless you buy the packs. Very disappointing. The coins that the aliens give should scale with how hard they are to defeat or what wave they are. Please balance the aliens and the weapons. Force shields are very hard even for max level energy weapons and the multiple-lasers-on-a-target debuff is stupid.', ""Great game very fun BUT (huge but), you can't buy upgrades without money. NONE of them. What a game killer."", ""This game is great. It is exactly what I wanted to install. To all the people giving this lower stars because it is to hard THATS THE POINT! If it's to challenging dont get stuck up cause you cant win. Thanks you HEXAGE for making yet another great game, and sorry I haven't posted a review on so long XD"", ""Amazing! I used to have this game back when I had a blackberry playbook and had to install this again. The gameplay is the same but we'll see what else is in store. I purchased the upgrade packs but I don't know if it's possible to restore hence the 4 stars."", ""This game is awesome. Yes you have to purchase the add-ons if you want those weapons, but you can beat this game without them, it's just significantly harder. The add-ons are worth the price for the hours of game play you'll get out of this game. I highly recommend this game if you enjoy a good, well thought out tower defense game with a great story."", 'Possibly best of a crowded genre. Getting to build the route is a game changer. Can buy all extra towers for a total of $8.', ""I except the challenge to pass level 3 and beat the game with out buying eny thang look up Hydra_Wafflez on YouTube then it should pop up Nova6_Clipzz I expect the challenge if this game is this hard then I'll beat it."", ""Frustrating. It's impossible to get pass by the Mission 4. No matter how I strategized, I always ended up loosing the mission. The great weapons that are perfect to use are those that are locked and needed to buy the pack-what-so-ever to have it unlock and to be abke to use it. I'm uninstalling this."", 'Okay tower defense with an unsatisfying gameplay. Tower inaccuracies are supposed to be part of the planning, but it just feels like poor implementation, in combination with the bad tower AI. Explanations and UI could be designed better. Enemy and tower explanation should be made more easily accessible.', 'This game is alot of fun and challenging.

There should be a money generator or something. Please make one.', ""Nice idea, relaxing sound and graphics, but I don't relaxe so much because I can't beat mission 3. It's frustrating. It's thrice I downloaded the game in a year, last time I bought 2 packs and still cannot beat it, I'm uninstalling it and I'll only come back if I see a decent update that modify the situation. I'll keep an eye for updates because I really like the idea and the concept, but I can't play it, so, why waste my time?"", ""Great tower defense game. Decent variety of towers and great variety of enemies. The module system allows you to edit the map as you play for most levels for a neat new dynamic. There is one fatal flaw, however. The tower AI is absolute garbage. The player has no access to targeting options, yet the towers seemingly can't stick to one. This leads to an unfortunate reliance on RNG if you want to play conservatively."", 'I had the game on another device which i no longer have. I had paid to get all of the upgrade packs, when I used the same account on my new phone I didnt have any of my upgrades & lost all progress in the game (which isnt too bad because I like playin so much) so I have to start over and cant even use all the weapons and the money multiplier thing that i payed for 😡😠.

And I don't feel like the turret upgrades actually do anything, it's just an awkward waste of gold."", ""It's good but It gotten boring to quickly. It needs to have a better amount of energy In it. Like in most tower games progress is slow but I just gave three stars because it's a decent game. I'll love to give five stars but I just stopped playing. Good game. Very good tower defense people need to play this because there is no need for tapping🙆. Most tower defense I play have very weird mechanics. But this game is also good because it has not so very expensive turrets."", 'I played this game daily until completion with all achievements 9th Jan 2019. I check back in to see if any of the millions of updates this app has had provided any more levels. Shockingly not a single level or achievement in a year. No game content updates in a year?

I never take the time to review, but this game was worth it by far!"", ""PROGRAM BUG! When upgrading a tower, you need to tap the screen 3 times: once on the tower, and twice adjacent. Well, 30% of the time, when you tap adjacent to the tower, the program determines you'd like to place a new tower on the adjacent cell. Now you've got to start over to upgrade, requiring 6 or more screen taps to succeed, very annoying - especially when attempting to stem an onslaught. Also occurs when mining. If in upgrade mode, then assume that's wanted when adjacent cell is tapped"", ""It's a good game. I just don't get why someone it's just starts a map when you're not even touching the phone.

Simple. No need to pay, but think about supporting the dev! Only banner ads, which any purchase would remove. One suggestion would be to allow players to see the enemies for each level after it has been completed, because that would allow you to pick appropriate towers.', 'Good game, easy controls, very simple, but in the best way possible.', 'Nice game, spend a few days on beating all the levels. Some of the later levels are hard to beat, so it is a good challenge. All levels are totally beatable without having to pay one cent.', ""Simple and fun tower defense.

The ads at the bottom of the screen cover up some of the user interface. I can't tell how many gems things cost because the ads are too big. Secondly, some of the enemies are ridiculously overpowered. Some of the enemies destroy your Towers when they get injured.

Gameplay simple but no worries, it's not that easy. Nice graphics. All good! I wish there were more games like this!"", ""I'd give it more stars if i could. I rarely review games but this one definitely deserves it. Great tower defense game with a great difficulty curve.

All in all a very pleasant game that respects the player as one. It has become a family favourite."", 'This is a good tower game... Strategic and fun. You dont read that often.', ""Of all the tower defense games I've played, so far (end of act 2) this is one of the few that don't abuse giving creep ridiculous amounts of health. It's not brain dead easy, but it's not annoyingly precise where if you spend money on a tower that isn't placed optimally, you might as well restart. I love it. Very well balanced and the micro transactions (although overt) are 100% ignorable and optional."", ""best tower defence I've played in ages. truly is. simple but really enjoyable wth Replay for every level to collect the maps and treasures to upgrade your weapons. my only concern is the reliance on crystals when mobs are swarming to unleash the big guns. you only get ads from completing levels to get these crystals. if you don't complete, you have to buy them. so i think there will eventually come a point where i can't progress without a purchase. until then, really enjoying it!"", ""It was fun. Got through all the levels and was able to do everything without buying the premium currency. I saved it all until the end and used all the free ones I'd gotten to finish the last few stars/relics."", ""Digfender is a pretty cool game. Standard tower defense, but with a little innovation in how you get to choose your path. My only problem with the game is that it's a bit too easy. In the beginning you are learning how it works, and getting introduced to the details takes some time. But then there are 40 levels of the same thing: you beat it in 1 try and then you beat it again for the relic. Then randomly there's a couple hard levels thrown in the mix. But getting all 72 relics did feel good."", ""Awesome take on the tower defense genre. Designing your own path adds a whole other element to the challenge, and it's handled very well in this game. Digfender is 100% playable without purchases. Adds are unobtrusive and mechanics are solid. I'd love to see a bit more varity added tower-wise, either a new type or new branches for upgrades, but I'm abput halfway through and it's keeping me hooked. Definitely keeping an eye on Mugshot Games from now on."", ""This game is great. I've played through bit to make sure it wasn't a sham, but the developers made a fun game, and put it front and center for free. You don't need microtransactions to progress. Not at all. But I bought some because they removed ads , and I thought it was fair. This is the icon of the mobile business market in my eyes, and if more games were like this, I'd actually play more mobile games."", ""Pretty fun but the difficulty scales so steeply that it isn't fun for long. Controls are good except when you're digging, can be easy to highlight a spot instead of continuing your dig. Upgrades are garbage as well as few and far between, stealing any chance at a sense of accomplishment. Enemies get cool unique upgrades while the player is stuck with crappy incremental upgrades, scaling the difficulty even further. All in all, good mechanics executed poorly."", 'past a certain point you are really good or the game pushes you to use certain skills which uses diamond.. which, you guessed it, costs money. Yes you can find it in-game but the skills are not cheap. You find around 20 diamond and a skill use is ten times the amount, so you are forced to watch some videos for diamond.. for a game I paid to not see commercials..', 'Great TD game without too much advertising. A lot of games freeze and crash my old Hudl 2 but Digfender seems light and slick. I Bought one special offer not because I needed to but to support the developers 👏']"

Nevertheless, great work on the mechanics of the game.

You can tell that this is a game that took a decent amount of time and effort to create. Only reason for three stars is the forced review for random levels and the constant requests to rate it. Good that it doesn't beg for 5 stars though."", ""Excellent gameplay, very engaging. The puzzles are fun and challenging; restarting is easy if you screw up and there's a bit of reflex involved. That said ... Level 17 still seems impossible without vaccines. Just ... not beatable. If anyone else knows how to beat it, I beg of you, share your secrets!"", 'Beaten this game many times as a kid on kongregate still just as fun as ever. And don\'t listen to all those people saying ""the game is forcing you to pay"" every level is just as it was on kongregate (before any more transactions) at least areas 1 and 2 the absorbtion stuff is new to me (and I don\'t like it). Just to prove it, here is a tip for 3 staring level 17: rush to capture two red cells, keep the capturing cell over 40 (spam it with tentacles), capture the last one while it is attacking', 'The game play is fun enough, but the design is such that you are always outnumbered by more powerful enemies, pushing you hard towards in-app purchases. There are different kinds of cells that behave differently, but they look the same, causing you to make errors and waste valuable time that your opponents never do. It is very frustrating and after completing most levels, I deleted the app.', ""I love this game and I think it's really fun! It's a great idea and very unique. I also love how it starts out easy, but then gets a lot more challenging pretty soon. I was recently I was browsing the play store, then I found a complete modern ripoff of this game. I was pretty mad when I saw that it was on the front page and not this."", ""Addicting I must admit. Couldn't even find the time to post and rate this app b'cuz was too busy being hooked on it. Love the game play. Love the game rules. Loved the game conditions for challenges, rewards and punishment. Interesting role of the agents and the varieties of their forms. Want more. There should be more sequels to this game. Maybe with introduction to more cell types. More modification to the limutations and features for possible cources of action or tactical approaches."", 'Saying ""IMPOSSIBLE"" about any levels? Well you are wrong as I watched a speedrun and it helped me a ton. Four words: THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX. Amazing game for everyone who likes to play any strategy games or any game particularly should play this game.', 'Really liked most of it but hated the absorption cells. Also some of the levels start you off with such a high handicap that no matter what you do the enemy is so powerful by the time you get any power that there is no hope without a vaccine, especially in the levels where there is primarily absorption cells.', ""It's really fun and kinda hard. I don't really know what else to say but I'm also typing this to try out the random levels thing. Also don't use all of your green syringe thing's."", ""It's a worth it game, expect some levels to be hard enough to use the items on, of those the one that turns a non friendly tentacle into an ally is best. you can grind on the minigame levels for the coins if you want the time sink if you are losing in the minigame, lose to get the coins instead of restarting that being said I am 200+ lvls in and find it fun and it's very rare to have to use an item"", 'One of the levels are actually LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE!!! I tried this level OVER AND OVER AND OVER again until I just gave up and uninstalled the game!! This level gives the enemy like 1 HUGE cell and like 5 little ones but then only gives the player 1 HUGE one that gets decimated so fast and 3 little ones that are almost no help!! Nevermind this is still the FIRST PART OF THE STORY!!!', ""Way too difficult. You can't beat half the levels unless you play perfectly. The computer always has more resources than you and you're, more often than not, in a terrible position able to be attacked from all sides. I don't mind a little difficulty, but playing a level over and over and over again just so you can learn the computers patterns and counter them isn't fun. The absorption cells are far to cumbersome to use efficiently and you'll spend all your time trying to protect them."", 'Zone 17 is litteraly impossible to 3 star. There is zero strategy in this zone. There simply is never enough time to get around the wall and kill all the red cells before your star goes away. You cant use vaccines to get by either. Vaccines instantly make you go to 1 star. Infuriating cheese. The ai will always hang on just long enough to take away your star.', ""Awesome game ! well the first few levels are awesome then it gets to the point where it's impossible to win unless you got some items that need to be bought with real money, aka pay to win. A shame the the devs resort to this kind of tactics to force you to buy their stuff"", 'Completed this game 7 or 8 years ago and it was brilliant. Once I did it, I went back and fought for all stars, and I felt like I was playing completely different game since I had to play it strategical and fast. Definitely recommended 5/5.', ""It's a very fun game and like the concept... But it's just SO ANOYINGLY HARD,I know you're supposed use tactics,but WHATEVER I DO,I LOSE NOMATTER WHAT!!!! And it drives me F***ING MAD,THE ENEMY ALLWAYS DEFEATS ME IN LESS THAN A MINUTE,I'VE TRIED EVERYTHING I COULD, EVERY SINGLE OPTION I HAD... YET I LOST AT EVERY TRY.

I put off trying this game out because of the title, but when i tried it, i couldn't put it down! Excellent theme and visuals paired with genuinely good gameplay makes this the best mobile game I've played in a long, long time!"", ""I played this game on the pc where the controls are much smoother. There are 3 stars per lv (on the pc there aren't stars, just score) and I'm doing some of these as fast as humanly possible, yet only come up with 2 stars in the first area of the game no less."", 'Great game until the bugs in tap/touches come. After that it just becomes annoying. Had to uninstall to get rid of the frustration. Also randomly the games just resets and locks all levels. Had to start from level 1 after which this 1 rating came. I wish I could give 0.', 'Another pay or lose kind of game. The first few levels were okay, but eventually you just get to a point where you opponent is physically impossible to beat, they spawn with significantly higher numbers and more spores so reinforce quicker, meaning regardless what you do tactically you will still lose unless you have one of the paid for items. I cannot stand games that place you in front of impossible to beat odds to force you to pay if you want to keep playing', 'Played the s**t out this game..unlocked the 3rd level, come back to the game a day latter and all my progress was gone. A complete waste of time, if I could give a negative review I would.', 'One of the best games out there hands down! Great concept, pleasant graphics and atmospheric music make this game a true masterpiece. Congrats to the creators. The gameplay can be very challenging, but never frustrating. A must download;)', ""Not worth the struggle. Played 6 missions and then got a little out of hand. 5 empty spots to over take. You can only generate 30 per circle meanwhile opponent starts with 50 that can over take you easily. Even cutting off the ends to max 30 in the circle still allows opponent of max 50 to over take. I'm not about to pay for a game or in app purchases that I cant see myself playing more than a day."", 'There are ads all the time and you cant even get more vaccines without buying more and when the purple things try to take over a cell they do it faster than you it is annoying and it always glitches you out and stops the game and you have to redo the whole level again if i could i would give it 0 stars', 'This game is designed to take your money. Not worth your time. It first starts off as an okay challenge ramping it gradually. Then it hits you in the face like a bag of bricks trying to temp you to buy th vaccine shots. Not worth your time in the long run', 'Really nice and hard game. The only thing is that some moves are not properly explained. If you like strategy games, you must try it', ""This game is unpredictable! Same puzzle can be solved in many ways yet, there are hidden tricks that may or may not help you improve your strategy (no hacks). Time is of essence here, and like biological forms, it's about the survival of the fittest, these digital bugs become aggressive. It makes me think of different alternatives that otherwise I wouldn't. Every time I was exterminated, it forced me to think what went wrong with my approach. Addictive! Well done!!!"", ""I love that is strategy-based it is really challenging and it has plenty of levels to choose from also its a amazing time consumer the only problem that I have with the game is that you can't choose the color that's you are playing ass and that's pretty much it"", ""It's really addictive, easy to learn and easy to play. Challenging levels that prod at your mind making you think differently to win. All together a good game. Great for passing time or binging for an hour."", 'I really enjoyed the game. It was fun and challenging. The only reason for the one star is that it forced me to rate it to play more levels.', 'Good enough game but not very balanced. The enemy starts with more points, seems like they just have an upper hand in some matches which makes it more frustrating than fun. Some levels far to easy. Doesnt feel balanced.', 'Up until the second area is fun, you give the enemy an advantage because the ai is normally bad, but in the second area, the ai uses precise, human tactic WITH the advantage, tuus the game is super unfair on specific levels since they can just suppress you out of the gate with their advantage and good ai.', ""Its decent. It's free. Makes for a good time killer. Can't really ask for much more. It requires a review to unlock part of the game though. That's the only reason it doesn't get 5 stars."", 'Fun game, does get quite difficult, would like to see something that makes your organism seem more unique than the others some kind of an ability that gives you a much needed edge against the difficult AI', 'My experience was challenging, I found it very hard to beat some levels and I think there should watch an add and see where you go first or something but overall it was fun and challenging', ""Couldn't get the hang of it at first, but after a while got the hang of it. Worth playing, it's strangely addictive. Also it does have ads but they're not too often unlike other games where you get an ad every 30 seconds. I LIKE IT. I don't normally bother rating things but I believe this game is worth the 2 mins it took."", 'Overall a fun game. I may just be stupid, but these got pretty challenging at times. Sucks that part of the game is stuck behind a rating.', ""If you looked at the critical reviews. Don't listen to them they are dumb people who can't play the game. The game is fairly nice, some levels are difficult true, but that's what games are for a challenge. Those people want the easy way out so don't listen to them. The game is a brilliant strategy game. Love it, the ads are ok not too frequent, the game is an interesting concept."", 'Overall, good. I would recommend. Not to many ads, they don\'t get in the way either. Only complaint is that sometimes the ""constructs"" of the game doesn\'t make sense, but it only a game!']"

I don't see anyone using different stratigies they are just using the same powers, same towers and same rushes mainly because the things there using are insainly overpowered.

Overall, the game is great just look after it more."", ""The game has so much potential, but it sucks that most matches only end at around round 20. It's too easy to win, just send a red moab then it's done. Perhaps make the cost of sending moabs at a much expensive price or prohibit sending moabs until round 30 or something cuz I think the game would be much more fun if matches would last longer. Another thing is also the powerups, too OP. There wasn't a single time I wouldn't be able to play against someone with 3000+ medallions."", ""This is a really good game. The app runs very smoothly and the game, being in the online strategy category, is well rounded, never leaving you bored or unsatisfied (unless you're afraid of competition and/or suck at tower defence games).

I haven't uninstalled it like all the other games because it's just so addictive. You get to earn medallions and have new scores. It's hard to pry it away. I just wish we could actually say what we want to say and search for usernames somewhere and if they're online, we could have a battle. (That is mainly the purpose so I can play with my friend.) I don't think I'll ever get old of it but I do wish we could see what percentage we really have. That's it."", ""I would like to say I absolutely love this game, but it needs fixed. Cobra absolutely needs to be scrapped. Its basically cheating if your opponent can take your lives even if you have a 10x better defense. Rushes are extremely easy and powerful. As long as you have a couple thousand coins you can all-out rainbow regen rush your opponent, it's full proof with hardly any way to defend. Powers need to be needed too, stunning the enemy's towers have nothing to do with skill or defense."", ""This game has alot of potential and is hands down one of the best games on the market !,but the bug needs FIXED badly where you load onto a lobby and your internet connection disconnects and you forfeit the match loosing what ever the wager was which in my eyes isn't very fair but in my case I disconnect for litterally 3 seconds and I've just lost a small fortune other than that all I would ask is more towers be added to the game"", ""I love this game. This is the only game I've played today. I watched youtubers play this a lot and I've played it a lot too. I love that you can just keep playing and playing over and over again without having to spend medallions on fights. The only thing I don't like is that you have to have club to play bananza or r3 speed bananza. I don't care about the other club required game modes but I just would love to play bananza or r3 speed bananza. Other than that it's amazing! Great job!😀👍"", ""A very addictive game, however I've been having a problem when maybe once a week I get a black screen when I'm trying to load up the game and it doesn't go away till a delete the game and wait till the next day. Everything else is perfect though, well done Ninja Kiwi. Update: I have lost my game data on my old account and I'm very confused as I had it linked to my google play account.

Like, twitter and LINE? So I can invite my friends easily. And when will the new towers or powers come? Add a lot of towers or powers so the game will not be boring time by time. Is there any languages other than english? My friend is Japanese and he don't really understand the game. I'm just teaching him how to play it. I hope this game will be better and popular in the future!"", 'Weekly leader board popup has ""try again"" button but no ""X"" to close it what kinda bull is that? Force me to close and reopen my app for lack of a button on a forced popup i dont care about, and what the hell is with settings menu having same trophie list as the trophy list button? Settings menu in general lacking on anything but sound, like where is the power saving low graphics button? Good game still hacked together in some places like not having assault practice and only defence practice.', ""I like the game itself, and I like the fact you could play the club despite the fact that you are not a member. One thing though, I don't like the fact you have to wait and buy towers. You have to play a lot of games before you can get things like the submarine. On top of that, you have to buy upgrades like the robo monkey. You wait until you have enough medallions and then, spend them all. Otherwise, a great game."", ""Great game, very fun and could play for days, it's fun but not too competitive, but if wanted to play competitively you can. the only thing I don't like is if theres a balloon like a ceramic it only deals 8 damage, but if it breaks then goes in it's instant game over. only complaint though."", ""I love this game and I've been playing for years. I had all towers unlocked at the fullest levels. I'm quite seasoned at this game. But, I logged back in and it reset all my towers. I don't have all the ones I bought plus I'm missing all my data. My coins are that thankfully still there however they can't get me my tower levels back. I just need help getting them back and I don't know what to do."", ""Honestly this game is great. No matter how many times I delete it I always end up coming back to it. Don't listen to the other bad reviews, because most of them are just people complaining and being picky about how challenging the game is. What I love most about the game is how different each individual match is. It feel like all new experiences."", ""Wow! this game is Amazing! It's fun and addicting. It's also quite simple when you have specific towers but I gave my review 4 stars because it does have slight bugs such as today, I came on and it doesn't go off 8h 0m so that's the only thing that gets me about this game"", 'I really hate this. I was going to play bannaza as soon as I started the game they told me ""disconnected "" and I had to wait 11 hours to play it again it happened again I will .. I raged and deleted the game and I will never download it again until something happens here is my name by the way: Mazen. With 16611 trophies..... I hate this soooooo bad', ""I like it its pretty good it never gets old. It gets addicting when you play a lot and challenging cause the rounds get harder and harder. I like this game cause there is different strategies you could use. This game entertains me , ecspesially when Youtubers play it. I enjoy this game a lot it's fun it's also you need some IQ to pass some levels. You could get addicted easily I really enjoy it even streamers play it a lot of famous gamers play it and that shows that this is a actual good game."", ""It's a fun game overall but big improvement: THEY NEED TO CAP BATTLE ARENA. For example, the very first arena is using only 5 medallions (basically trophies). A 40 medallion player shouldn't be going against a 1500 medallion player. It isn't fair. The game needs to cap the first arena to say 200 so beginners have an easier time advancing."", 'This game is EXTREMELY AMAZING, I love that you go on special arenas every day. (My favourite being boosty bananza fire) My favourite round is round 43 cuz u get to see the Z.O.M.G (zepplin of mighty destruction) and my favourite tower is the helicopter. I would give this game 50 stars if I could but instead 5. If you are new to this game the balloon types are:red,blue,green, yellow, pink, black or white, zebra, rainbow, ceramic, then, the Moab, Bfb and Zomg. The other are metal regrow and camo.', ""OMG where to start, I love love love this game, my cousin had recommend me to play it so I started and I didn't really get it at first but me and him have become like extremely addicted to it and I love that there are so many different characters and stuff, one thing I would recommend tho, is that when competing against friends that you could get rewards if u win still oh and that the competition things didn't cost money lol but overall best game EVERR ✌️👏👏👏👏👏"", ""The bloons feel is there, but enjoyment of the game is locked away by an oppressive monkey farm meta. Every person who plays this game seriously uses the exact same strategy and it seems the development team doesn't plan on doing anything to balance things out. If you are looking for a fun, chill game to play, this is far from it."", ""This game was one of the best strategy and tower games I've played. And I played a lot of strategy or tower games and this is definitely in my top 3 best tower defense and strategy games I've ever played with many upgrades and a good amount of tower selections, Bloons TD Battles, definitely top 3 in my list."", ""You NEED the sign in to give the option of, which game profile are you using, not go straight to dominant profile. Epic game, 5 stars 100%, but I could not find a work around without having to delete the dominant profile, and it shouldn't have to come to that, Every, Time, we want to change profiles... Especially when we have two devices both with same dominant profile, one is active online, and other can not even access the game unless the data is cleared Twice, because auto log dominant...."", 'This game is good but I still have on complaint that I am not sure that is the games fault or my phones but when I do those quest to other apps for 🎖it just shows a white screen, like I said this game is awesome but I just had to ask if this is happening to other people or is it just my crappy phone', ""From 5 stars to 2 stars, this game has one of the worst connectivity issues there ever is. Even if i've got a fast internet connection, whenever entering matches- i always get disconnected. I always try opening google or stream something on youtube to check if it's my internet who's got a problem or not, but no...it's always the game itself and i'd rather play something else rather than getting random disconnection notices.""]"

Good luck in the dungeons!","[""This game is fun and all, but it can be so damn annoying sometimes. The feature that makes you stop playing is useful, but when youre doing something important and it forces you out and all your gold gets stolen its not fair, just give a warning before hand alright? Also, disabling traps when theyre being upgraded when theyre so vital to my base undermines all the effort i put into it, it's dumb. My last problem is the feature where if you die enough, a trap is disabled.Again, mocking my effort"", 'I am currently level 140 in a guild that is level 19 and I am in the 2nd to last league(I have been demoted and promoted in these last couple leagues probably 50 or so times)and have a gem count of 85mil. You reach basically a paywall with the KoK league I cant progress without dropping 50-100 dollars which as a full time college student is not really possible. But the developers are some of the most active and well informed devs as they always have events to keep you interested all in all A+', 'The reason I giving this game 3 stars is when I first pull up the game and I was on it seem like a really good game then it pop up saying your thing is done so I click and tried to move somthing but the hole game was frozen so I did it again and the same thing happened so I delete the game and started over and the same thing happened again so I delete it fix it please and I will start playing it again thanks', 'An amazing platformer that has a sense of progression as you make your way to be THE King of Theives, the skill and trap upgrades may take time but its worth it when you have high level traps and an amazing base layout. Taking a long time to save a layout is satisfying and raiding other peoples dungeons is also fun. It also requires incredible precision and accuracy while raiding and saving bases, which provides skill. Getting that Flawless run on your 1st try is incredibly rewarding. Very Fun!', ""I love the game however there is one problem I'm right now in the sapphire league and no one I find or raid has gems good enough for me to rank up the league. I'm always finding people with gems that would help them win the bronze league"", 'Everything about this game is great. But i wnat them to make it where you either try to get the amount of gems from people or get a certain amount of points from the gems to go to the next rank and itll get harder and harder so if they do, do this then you better get ready.', ""Ok this game is great, great concept, fun gameplay, cool courses especially since I know other people made them but it's very hard to not quit the game when someone steals your gem, you perfect their dungeon, and don't get your gem back all I'm saying is possibly tweak the ratio of getgem/dontgetgem"", ""King of Thieves is a great game. I enjoy it daily. I like the graphics, and gameplay. The controls are very easy to use, but I wish y'all can add more content, more gaming stuff, or more better events. Even though it's still a great game."", 'Feels like a fun mix of Mario maker, Mario run and clash of clans. I had a lot of fun already and the game like you have a lot more control than other mobile apps. But I would like if the player got to choose the shape of their dungeon.', ""Very fun and addictive especially when you collect all that gold from your mine from yesterday that kept pouring up cuz that's pretty satisfying, as well as finding a player and getting some gold at least over 1000. In a nutshell some parts are addictive others are barely non-enjoyable."", ""The developers do not update the game aside from repeat events that just eat orbs and take money . For 8 months that I've played now, no new content has been added in the form of spells.. you buy spheres and literally just get a rare gem which does absolutely nothing!"", 'It is a great game i play it all the time but my game has a bug where i cant save any gems which makes it harder for me to get past leagues. Hope you can fix this.', ""I love this game, but since I got a new phone the cloud isn't pulling up my old game and I had allot of progress."", 'it is a really good and fun game, and I suggest it to anyone, I like how there is many different things to do. I wish that events were more common, but maybe they should only happen once a week idk. good game 10/10', 'Fun to play! Really addictive, Its a little boring at first but I love It!!! But one suggestion I think you should add skins to the obstacles like the saw could have a skin with a skull in the middle and spinning knives', 'it is good but one of the characters has a word that is not appropriate for a 3 rated game the description of the Marilyn Red skin is the sex symbol from early updates. The word sex is not appropriate for that age', 'Fun game that gives you multiple ways of playing and a fun story mode on the side of its pvp lnowing that you and others get to desighn their own bases makes you want to enhance your knowledge on the game.', 'Awesome!!!! My experience is cool because Strategy makes me think what my move in grabbing the gems on totems. I love this game!!!!!😀😀😀', ""This game is really fun just that when I watch a add for certain rewards the game and the game would reload and I woudn't get any rewards, so its as if I didn't even watch the add."", 'King Of thieves is fun, logical, and ingenuative, making it such a great game. I really love the graphics style, and I enjoy playing this.', ""I love it I only bought it a few hours ago and I can't stop playing I love that it is a game that is simple and repetitive but it also has some features as in I upgraded a fly to level 9 and I'm level 4"", 'To start off: 1. They need to make updates. 2. Fix the unbeatable dungeons that are reported. 3. Fix all the patches that the hacker are using to cheat on the game. 4. Add new potions, they say ""coming soon"" but it\'s been months. 5. Fix it so it could work on 19:9 aspect ratio and foldable phones. And last one 6. Pay attention to the ratings and feedbacks.', ""This game is the best because there is so much to do and free stuff to get by watching ads AND there's alwyays a weekly event so that makes this game the best!"", ""this game is awesome it's a really fun game to play it has a lot of things to do you can steal players gems from across the globe there's leagues mazes and so much more I really recommend this game😁"", ""I can't get me gems back for some reason every time I get to the end of the level I get error code 8 some please tell me how to fix this"", 'The game is a fun and fair, but brutal experience. The mechanics are very well laid out and require great skill to raid well built dungeons. However it is definitely a game skewed towards those who dish out cash for orbs. Potions are a good way to negate much of the skill factor which is perfectly fine, but just know that you may be in a situation where you have no orbs to buy potions. There are plenty of ways to earn the premium currency orbs, but they are often only enough for a few potions.', ""Game is fun. Zeptolabs is terrible. Try and talk to support and you'll talk to a different person each time. You'll end up explaining the same thing to 5 people that don't even help. Aside from that, I cancelled my subscription. Had over 1000 keys saved to play. They deleted my keys when I cancelled my subscription. Such a dirty company."", ""1 guy is attacking my castle from last 10 minutes, and i can't get in to the game. Please add live raide option."", ""Took me all of two minutes to remember why I stopped playing this. If you're not spending money every day or watching 5-8 adds every minute or two then you can't play the game. Starting off you have enough keys to play somewhat consistantly, but level up a bit and you'll find that breaking in to one dungeon can cost you upwards of 30 keys. Make your money by having me buy cosmetics. King of Thieves is an appropriate name for these devs not the game. ( This Is Not An Over Exaggeration )"", ""King of Thieves can be a really fun game. Customizing my dungeon and stealing from others is great! The single-player/story levels are lackluster, however, and I only play them for the occasional gem. There are other issues, however. The blue orb currency can be hard to come by and many nice things are locked behind this. I wouldn't say this game is pay to win, but more pay for an advantage. I don't waste money on these games, however, and it's still fun. Just be aware of all the pay stuff."", ""I realy enjoy playing this game, but the only problems are the time of the rituals and it's not on PC or xbox"", 'The game is fun smooth and has a good story line and plenty of combinations for dungeons so you never get bored of raiding. Also it dosent come with forced ads', 'READ THIS DEVS: I really like this game and I did get rid of it a while ago, and then reinstalled it recently. The only reason I really have a problem with this game is that I run out of keys so fast and I either have to watch and ad only to get 2 keys or wait forever. If you could change that, it would be great. Maybe if you made it so you get keys faster but have like a max of 100. You could also make it so when you have 0 keys, you can watch an ad and get 3 or 4. It would help alot. Thanks', ""I find it very fun and interesting of how you play the game. The aim of the game is to find a way to get past others traps to steel treasure well make your own trap to stop players from taking you treasure. Even though the controls are a bit weird at first you'll get use to them witch can help you progress. What I think about the game is its very fun and enjoyable."", 'Crappy af game. You spend 50 orbs so you should have a chance to still go to the next checkpoint and theres no chance because you get an impossible spawn and then gg, you just wasted 50 orbs. Uninstalled.', 'Sorry i rate 2 stars , but i have some recommendations to you 1. Can you please change how to ""save"" ? Because to save , ehy you need to the chest 2 times IN A ROW. I suggest remove the IN A ROW because its difficult. Maybe 2 times is good, but that doesn\'t mean you can do it twice with luck and faith. 2. When you entered the another player dungeon to steal the gold in the chest, why you cant just make it left to right easier ? Why need to jump from another wall ? Just make it simple. Thank you', 'I have this game on my PC and it is very fun collecting gems, stealing other peoples gems, unlocking different areas, to going through mazes it is a very fun game to play not that buggy. Buying upgrades and different dongens is very useful in alot of cases. I do recommend playing this game. :D', ""Coming back to this game is a real challenge. Getting gems, picking the right locks, and hard dungeons limit the gameplay of this game. I used to play this game before but at the moment, it's more of a pay to win game rather than a fun and creative game. I always get dungeons that have lvl. 46 traps & 100+ level players when I still yet am lvl. 50 with a wise judge throne. It's irritating being raided by higher players that spent more time on this game. The overall gameplay lowered in quality."", 'honestly the most FUN game ever first of the gameplay is so simple and very easy which makes it very good second off the throne thing is an amazing idea it gives you that real king feeling third of the mechanics of the traps are very good and all i have to say is keep up the good work zeptolab', ""I was about 11 when I first played this game, and I broke my phone, and forgot about it, but soon enough 4 years later, I found it, downloaded it, and it's as addicting as ever, really brings memories back""]"

• Technical improvements to support future releases
• Bug fixes and optimisations","[""I play the game sometimes on my phone which runs quite good, then when I run it on my tablet (4gb ram and 30+gb free storage android 8, realistically I doubt it will get android 9. Brand new only came out in 2019). It judders/laggy why can't you optimize it for tablets which are not as powerful as expensive phones. I don't want to strain my eyes looking at a small screen while playing games all the time."", ""A fun game, but I have a few problems. One is the Revenge attack option. When you get revenge on someone, they can attack you back. Thai goes on for forever, and it's no fun. Another is a glitch where you get a 100 percent raid, but lose credits for it and get 0 percent. I am not sure why this happens, but one clue may be the fact that I cannot review the attack. Also, the troops that target turrets shoot at everything in their way, and they die because of it."", 'I absolutely love this game, and am addicted. I actually use to be level 7 on my Kindle but then I lost my progress and then the game got discontinued on Amazon devices so I was out of luck, but now that I have it back I am already almost level 4 after two days! The only complaint I have is graphics. I also have a suggestion, if you use gems to speed up the training/building process, there should be an occasional malfunction or accident occur between your troops/soldiers.', ""I absolutely love this game. It is essentially a skinned version of clash of clans, but I thing it does a much better job as far as game play. Clash forces players to either save a ridiculous amount of resources or buy gems in order to upgrade buildings and units. Star wars does a better job of balancing this. The amounts aren't as high and seem much more attainable, but players can buy crystals if they prefer to upgrade things quickly. I play this game daily and enjoy every bit of it."", 'I have a suggestion for the game, a pretty small one to be honest. Instead of taking all of your soldiers after a battle, why not make a medbay or a repair garage and keep the soldiers and vehicles that survived like all the other games that have the same gameplay as this. In other words this is a very good game and I would suggest this to a handfull of friends, but that small ittle detail just gets me a little bit fustrated.', 'Every aspect of the game is fine besides for the amount of new and better content. There should be more of a variety of bases because when maxed out, it is just gold and gold. There should also be more troops to use. There should be special upgrades to armor and weapons to make troops better. Also, it would be cool to have a Mandalorian mercenary', ""The concept is amazing. But I am giving it 3 stars (for now) because it can use a LOT of improvements. 1. The most important one for me is that I am not able to connect with my friends and see anyone who plays it via facebook. I know a few friends who play this and they are on facebook. We tried to connect with facebook but we just cannot see each others accounts. I actually even know what the bug is. 2. I would love it if I got to play both sides. Because I just can't pick one. 3. It would be helpful if I could select a few walls and upgrade them together. 4. Sometimes the game just slows down."", ""Pay to Play: This game is basically unplayable past level 3 unless you are willing to drop serious cash into it, feels bad. You have to wait 24+ hours to upgrade buildings in some cases. Could be a fun game if the economy didn't try to bleed every penny from its users. With so many entertainment options available this game isn't worth your time or money."", 'I m having a blast im obsessed ill being playing this game for a long time. You can join friends and do squad battles or send troops to each other. You can play as rebels or the empire. Its a cool time killer when your not home or fun at home while watching tv. Its got a fun campaign also. Should give it a try its a good game star wars fans should play no matter what. Other people should give it a try. Graphics are cool gameplay is fun.', 'I love this game I been playing this for two years but thir is one con to it it takes so long to upgrade building but it all worth it at the end. And it reminds me about how you suppose to have sertant rank to get access to something anyway I want to this game all the support I can give. If your a developer of this game thank you for making this.', ""This game is incredible to play in terms of gameplay, although there is a couple downsides.. it's pretty difficult to edit your base considering the smallest buildings take up too much room aswell as everything else. (You'll know what I mean if you play it long enough) the second downside is the time limited attacks, most games like this of course are time limited when attacking other bases or single player campaign, but only get 1min 30sec to attack. Need to give more time for attacks."", ""1. Please add slots to save training queues, it's so annoying to fulfill spaceports after each battle. The idea of stored presets is so easy and obvious. 2. The same about base layouts. We need at least 3 presets to use during dayly activities. One for heroic defense, another for rival defenses. One more for wars. It's so obvious, again. - Minus 1 star for each point ;)"", 'Units are way to expensive. And buffers are extremely long. Game needs to be rebalanced. The game itself is buggy as hell. Not to mention every time I open threw game it takes forever to load and the lock out screen times out when I unlock it restarts the game. Complete garbage. Rushed through production. Rushed through release. Left alone with all its issues.', 'The only thing keeping my 5 star away from this game is how poorly optimized every screen transition is. Invariably, open your barracks? 10 second freeze before the training page. Use the arrows to scroll to your factory from the same screen? 10 second delay. Want to hit play and attack? Few seconds. Want to access your crates and unit samples? You guessed it. I spend more time transitioning between screens than I do training troops and attacking. Could be a great SW basebuilder otherwise. Rip', ""It's a good game but i think the time it takes to upgrade is a bit ridiculous. I get that you can spend Crystal's but they are very hard to get like you only get 20 or 30 a month just wish it was a bit faster but the battles and construction of the base and moving planets is Brill 8/10"", 'I really enjoy this game, although I find that it is slightly held back by what I consider to be a few balance issues. In my opinion, the time given for attacks is not long enough, especially becoming worse as you progress. Additionally, I believe some buildings begin to take too long to upgrade rather suddenly around base level 4 or 5. Other than this and more minor issues, this game is very fun and interesting to play.', 'I play this about a year ago and I put in 3-4 MONTHS of progress and I loved it. This is a fun game for what it is. But one day I loved on and an error happened and ALL of my progress was GONE have a year gone in one day. So I warn you 1 day all your stuff might be gone. I will give it another chance and see how it goes.', ""I've spent about $75 on this game. The defects just gets worse as you progress.... It's Star Wars, so it's gotta be fun! But the game loads slow and reloads everytime you leave to check your email or chat. And another thing that really really annoys me... I have in-game sounds and music on silent, but everytime the game reloads, the lightsaber sound goes off! I wish it was better, but there's just too many good games out there to continue playing and hoping that the programmers will fix it."", 'Strategy games has been a fav of mine but my oh my star wars tales it to a whole new level. Giving it my best strategy of the moment. More of the same. To infinite and beyond!!! I guess you could add an open space feature were you get to travel round the galaxy fighting on diff planets and also make the bad guys easier to kill, nothing bores a game more than having to try to kill bad guys for a long time. Cheerio.', 'The game is solid, but I have a few minor gripes. The troops tend to attack walls unnecessarily, there should be an option to play two separate builds light/dark side (admittedly, I\'m not done with the story, and the ""paid"" currency is VERY infrequent. I have no problem paying for a game I enjoy, but these issues make it hard to want to continue.', ""It was fun when I first started playing. However, as I progressed further, I noticed a few things that ruined continuous playability for me. First, building/ training times. It's ridiculous that I have to wait up to 24 hours for 1 barrack to complete an upgrade or a platoon of troopers to be battle ready. I considered using crystals to bypass the waiting time, but that option requires a lot of crystals. I spend most of my time waiting rather than playing."", ""Great game. Good story. The game never gets boring. When you loose a defense, unlike other similar games ( Boom Beach), you don't loose everything. Upgrades are streamlined and easy. I got easily addicted to this game"", 'The EP needed for quest play is ridiculously long high for elite crates. Rebels get weak troops and the Empire is way powerful. War matchs are lopsided to Empires favor matching 9 to 11 Prestige Empire against 2 to 4 Rebels Prestige. I have lvl 9 Rebel base been on great squads but always in the Empires advantage. I love the game and the play but started an Empire base due to the above. Glitches big problem no way to contact developers after lots of money on crystals just SOL', 'Unless you have hours each day to spend on this game don\'t waste your time. Good luck trying to get a foothold in anything. You\'ll be attacjed constantly and even when under a ""shield."" The only thing the developer says is that you should build up defenses and play more. Not worth the time. Seems like they are now just mining for your money to get further in the game. Very disappointed with how downhill this game has gone', ""I love this game so much been playing for years now, however the biggest gripe I have is Greedy Disney their are so busy trying to find ways to get as much money out of your pocket to play the game they over look how many times a day the game crashes So Sad. UPDATE : after leaving a poor review I've noticed I barely get attacked anymore when I log on it shows I'm being scouted, by whom? Then when I attack a base no matter the lvl I lose REALLY DISNEY ?? Wow beware ppl I'm getting an investigator"", ""I love this game. It's similar to clash of clans but it's also very different in gameplay and design . The bad thing is that some upgrades go up in cost way too fast but that's just me being picky. Other than that I would 10/10 recommend"", ""Purchased alot of crystals the in game currency and then all of a sudden my account diasapeared and they say it can't be recovered , and they are not willing to give me my crystals back as I accepted I have to start again , full on robbery and disgusting , support is like talking to a robot there are better games out there ."", ""I would personally recommend this game to teens and older people... It's quite easy to get resources without paying with gems or real money if your strategic with your forces in the Empire, something newbies & younger kids don't know about. Anyhow, You lost a star for using a flawed chat filter that censors non explicit words, minus another for losing my orginal data progress, and lost 2 stars due to the TX-225 on the Empire's side not crushing walls."", ""Things need to coast less. And to buy another drone. It shouldn't be 500. You can't save anything but credit and alloy. And when you try and save those things lol you can't because everything coast to much. You should be able to buy a drone with credit and alloy other than that it's pretty good. But if you would make those changes for us players and who don't have money to."", ""I like this game quite a bit, although I'm pretty bad at it (I'm not the best tactician out there,) more often than not I rely on sheer numbers alone to overwhelm my opponent, which usually ends up either working perfectly or being a complete waist of resources, despite that I can't deny that this is a very solid game with decent graphics and fun gameplay."", 'This Game has been an application since 2013 since this time it has undergone alot of updates and changes. The game is relatively based off of how much you play it and the more you play it the harder the competitors get. It is also pretty squad based which revolves around other competitors giving their resources and time for another squad member. Which kind of brings out the social aspect of it as well. It a time based stratgey game that relys on placement and it takes too much time to play.', ""Waiting too long for things to upgrade. When upgrading a couple things it took 5 days too upgrade. While waiting for this to happen I downloaded a couple other games and lost interest in this one. Anytime it takes an hour to upgrade something or longer. I end up closing it and playing another one in which doesn't take forever to upgrade a headquarters should not take an hour to do. This why I haven't logged on in a couple weeks. What is the point"", 'Very fun to play. Lots of options for strategy, and for and base and troop placement. Very balanced where new players are matched to similar players so that even after starting several years after the game has been out you can still be competitive.', ""Good for a few days, then I realised it's so repetitive: attack a base, defend a base, attack a base, blah-blah-blah.The actual gameplay needs much more variety. Also, there's insane waits for stuff to upgrade, a baffling squad system, and after all this time spent upgrading the HQ and factory I'm still stuck with the basic model of vehicles. There's no incentive for me to continue investing time in this game. Bye!"", 'Initially this game is a lot of fun, then the wait times to upgrade get ridiculous. You’ll have to wait at least 24 hours to upgrade one building, while getting attacked by players many levels above you so there is no hope for defense. It is obvious this is a cash cow for Disney since crystals are the only way to upgrade faster, otherwise you just let the games sit on a shelf for days on end for upgrades to occur. The more you attack, the stronger the base as you get match so there’s never any hope for getting anywhere fast.', 'Alright, been playing for awhile, and this game does deserve more then 5 stars. But i have some requests for the developer. 1st, for the base layout, could you do an update where we can have multiple layouts? As well as be able to copy your home base layout to the war base layout in an update please.', ""Lots of fun but... the text is so tiny on my phone. I'm installing on my tablet to see if it's easier to play. My phone has a 5.8 in screen so it's not small by any means but very hard to read this game on it."", ""Base building mobile games are a dime a dozen. This one is entirely average, but star wars themed. Loot boxes and events to unlock special things abound. Feels slow at level 6. Not sure how active the playerbase is as I've not been attacked. You can be either empire or rebels. Functionally identical although empire asthetic is obviously superior. Kind of slow to load and sluggish to open menus or production screens."", ""Game is good... Main problem, you save for Troops, build troops start a mission then once it starts the game crash's you lose all your troops including the money spent building and have to start again.. this happens all the time.,......... Sort it out!!"", ""Overall I love this Game, I've been looking for a star Wars game like this one and now it's here. I really do wish there was a clone wars Version where you got to side with either the sepritists or the Republic but I'll just have to hope that'll one day be a thing. Great game, good controls, love the designs of the units and turrents, and great music choices for both sides. Great game""]"

It's still a good game to play and kill time but not a game to play if you think you can get far in without buying anything. F2P players have been left out in the current game status and has focused more on P2P players. I've bought over 1 million gems over the years and i have trouble keeping up with current P2P."", 'This game is very nice but if you grind for like a month or two you could get the Same result with 30-50 bucks in a Day or two', 'Good game with lots of different opportunities and heroes and also a lot of pets to equip to the heroes.

I know this is good for upgrades but come on igg!', ""This is a really fun game but it does have some need for improvement.

More power.', ""this game has been great fun- you can make friends, build a kingdom- its great! however i have noticed that it is always bringing up that to complete certain missions you need to spend real life money and buy certain things. that's all well and good with big missions with big rewards but for people with no free money or haven't got access to sums of money to waste, it's a bit agitating. but still, this game is great fun and i recommend anybody have a go."", 'Dis game is for people who love strategy and are patient.Although you can play successfully on free to play accounts, it is a bit easier and faster to play with some money in hand.On terms of bugs and glitches,throughout the years playing this game,I\'ve come to discover that most of the time they are fixed in the next update.I can assure you that I\'m not a bot or else I probably wouldn\'t have said ""dis"" at the start.I hope this was useful.I fully recommend this game.

Then when you reach the Challenger arenas, players that are 3 levels higher then you start matching with you. It's ridiculously annoying when your just trying to play and you go up against higher level opponents. It's literally impossible to beat them. The game is literally pay to win. I've given this game many chances but the matchmaking always ruins it."", 'So while I love this game and the game mechanics behind it, it is the most out of balance game. Not in the units, but in the matchmaking. The game pairs you up with people of similar trophies, but will decide when you win and when you lose. If you are too high of trophies for your level, it will pair you against decks that are meant to counter you. If you lose too many times, it will pair you against decks that you counter. There is no strategy in the end, just divine intervention from the devs.', ""I think it benefits players who spend a lot of money on the game to much. For the people that are free to play it's not so great. I heard it's supposed to be random battles, but when you start to win several you start getting matches against hard counters. Usually several in a row. And people with better cards. So it looks like there just trying to get you to spend money for upgrades. About to delete the game."", ""I don't understand who did the match making system but I don't think they understand the concept of balance. When you go into a match and your cards are out leveled by over 3 levels and your tower is under it makes it nearly impossible to even come close to winning. They tend to also favor putting you in those kinds of matchups after you win one or two games."", ""I mean I think the battle pass is a load of rubbish but apart from that it's still an amazing game and I enjoy it. I think it has gotten a bit too easy now though because it is really easy to get to the legendary arena and higher, back then it was nearly impossible to get to hog mountain or the other arenas that used to be the best. Oh and legendaries are really easy to get too. Apart from that, it's a good game."", ""WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!!!This game use to be fun until supercell got greedy. There's no strategy anymore... the game will be over before it starts based on your card selection and you can't see your opponants. It's just 3 minute intermus of getting your face beat in because you don't have cards to counter I suggest anyone thinking of downloading to look at all the recent low ratings!!!!!!"", ""The game is a fun and enjoyable game and although it seems easy to play you require a lot of skills. However it is hard to level up in this game which makes it frustrating when you face people of high levels. Supercell doesn't fix the level issue because this doesn't apply to the pros who are all already level 13. I HOPE Supercell can make it easier to level up to make this a game more fun and enjoyable and not just cashing on gems and stuff to try to level up."", ""I really wanted to like this game. I love the concept of it. But the matchmaking is horrible. I play against level 12 when I'm level 6... How does that even make sense? Also, the way this game is designed I'd that if you win 2 games in a row, then you lose 2 games in a row. It takes SOO long to rank up, this is more of a grind game. It's also a pay to win game, you can win just by paying. It's so stupid and the game is SO bad. Like, hackers in this game is too intense. Every 10th game is hacker."", ""App is great but ever since last night, it won't open. I tried getting help through sending feedback but haven't heard anything and got an automated response through email telling me to go into the game & ask for help from there but I can't do that since I can't even get in 😩 hopefully I get some help because I'm scared I'll lose all progress if I uninstall & reinstall"", 'Base game is entertaining. The better you get at the game though the more you realize the faults of it. Forced slow down with chest openings creates a need to purchase ways to open chests. Purchase prices are incredibly difficult to stomach. There is no player report button so the higher level players will cheat approximately 60% of the time. Clearly a lack of concern from the developers', ""I have played this game for 3 years (which they have failed to recognize) and I hate it. The only reason I still play is my friends. The pairing system is aweful. Cheats are also allowed. It's a pay to win game. I'd you pay for gems, you'll be better. No matter what. I'm a strategist, and I won most battles.

I know you won't see it."", 'The game as a whole is ok, but am now NOT impressed with their service. I tried to purchase a 19.99 deal they were offering, never recieved. I was told to wait and check back if it doesnt appear. I did exactly that, and was told they can do nothing for me. I have the screen shots as proof and would post them but google play doesnt seem to allow that.', ""It is a good strategy game but it has some flaws. Good part is that it has awesome graphics and easy to use. Bad part is that at some point, you get to battle against players who use money to get cards especially legendary ones ... and it really annoys me. It isn't fair. If you use real money to buy cards or chests then you should only get to battle those who have done the same. Seriously .....I get really annoyed. The matchmaking is really really bad. I would give a 2 star off 5 for it."", ""It's a good game for strategic players. But I it should also have a report option for the players who leave the 2v2 battles in between the match or even after starting a match. I really hate when such players enter as my partner in random options. So the developers should think about it and come to a decision for this problem. The worst thing about the game is the tie breaker. I don't like that."", ""It's a nice game if you like live action strategy. Stack your deck and use it wisely. You get a lot of noobs when you first start playing but as you level up and collect trophies things get more interesting as you run into more evenly matched players. The only drawback is the wait time to open chests is a little long. Quick, fun, and great for playing on those short breaks at work or at home."", ""This is a great game with an easy concept. That only problem with it is the same problem they have with every other supercell game. The matchmaking. They love to put you up against people that are so high level that anything you use can and will get one tapped. Other than that not too bad. Some op cards like the Pekka and mega night will never be fixed. I've come to terms with that😥"", ""from a player who played for 3 years 1. the inevitable problem with the so called free to play games like this one is that sooner or later you find yourself playing against either suckers that are several levels higher than you ( because they paid more) or noobs that you crush easily. there's rarely a good game win or lose. there's no satisfaction. 2. matching mechanism is especially bad for this one. 3. balance changes are a joke. one only needs to check their twitter account for history."", ""It's great that this game listens to the players at the highest level and makes balance changes based on that, but the normal players just trying to get to arena 13 or whatever are completely ignored. Players have been asking for nerfs to cards like wizard and mega knight for a while but they just get ignored and end up playing against them almost every game. While they aren't good at e sport level, the majority of the playerbase isn't e sport level and they suck to play against constantly."", ""It's a great game that just keeps on giving. I've been playing for over 4 years and it's still one of the only games I haven't deleted. Not only are you able to talk, play, and share with friends but you always having something new coming out like a new character card, new challenges, new bounces, and even more like the new pass royal that let's the hard core players get more for only $5!!"", ""Absolutely horrendous. Pay to win trash. What a giant turd this game has become. So much non sense going on. I need to spend 20 minutes just opening chests and watching slow animations while they try to sell me a fake with fake cards for $99. Are you kidding me?! I wouldn't pay a dime towards this awful game and you shouldn't either. Pay to win. Pay to win. Supercell has ruined games with a hard push to force kids to spend big money just to compete. Shame shame."", ""Note to retard developers: Although you may THINK you are punishing players for losing their connection while in a battle by not allowing them to team up for a time without letting them know that anymore because you know as well as we do that it isn't fair.... But it won't stop players (wink wink) that KNOW (statistically) when they are going to lose to just stop playing. How dumb can you guys get?"", ""Full of pay-to-win people, not fun at all. You don't need much skill to play this game, just pay them money. They don't support free-to-play people and their 2v2 algorithm is off balance. I had to fight a level 11 at level 6 multiple times. I don't recommend this unless you want to waste time. Disclaimer: This game will make you mad. I would rate 0 stars if I could"", ""To the Developers: my cards are at max level and now use stars. But i only get half the stars awarded to me. Example: When I open a chest it tells me I have a number of stars 155 and when it goes to tally up the Stars after getting out of the chest screen it's always Tally's up as much less 61. What gives? I'd like the rest of my stars so that I can give you the rest of your stars. I keep getting short changed on stars. I'm still wait for developers to respond! *****"", 'If you enjoy constantly being mismatched against opponents who have higher level cards and towers than yourself then this is the game for you. Supercell keeps doing ""balance changes"" (read random card changes) but don\'t address the horrible matchmaking algorithm, the entire way that they match you against opponents is based solely on your trophy count so you get punished quickly for having success and if you want to play for free forget about it unless you have years to dedicate to a mobile game', ""The game is absolute garbage. Based entirely on money spent and luck of the draw for your deck. The matchmaking is incredibly flawed. You'll be absolutely screwed of your WiFi is bad.

That is all that is good with it. The matchmaking is trash, does not matter how good your strategy is if you get paired with opponents who are at least 2 levels higher than you in both long tower level and card level.

I get the pass but this matchmaking I think it's just the game developers trying to get you to spend tons on money on gems so you can buy upgrades."", ""Could be a great game if it weren't for the serious Pay to win issues and fundamentally flawed matchmaking. I am routinely matched up against max level players (I'm level 11) with mostly or entirely maxed out units. Essentially, at least one of three things is true: 1) Matchmaking is rigged to discourage consecutive games 2) I'm so unbelievably good at the game it's only fair to match me up against impossible opponents 3) If they don't take card & player lvl into account, its simply bad design"", ""Addictive game, but aparent speed hacks. If you don't have the speed hacks don't waste your money trying to level your heros the speed hacks are faster and more powerful. How the people that made this game don't know about it is silly but it's what it is. Great game though even better if everyone was on the same playing field. Thumbs up"", ""I've played this game since launch day and it is still a very unique and fun game. I only have one major problem and that's the Mega Knight. The pay-to-win players use this card nonstop and it completely destroys everything and honestly is ruining matches that could be competitive. I'd say fix Ram Rider as well, but atleast you can get away without it completely destroying your towers. Simple balances would make this game as close to perfect as it could be."", ""This game has become quite unfun. Almost 80% of the games I play, I get matched up with players with higher levels. And I'm constantly going against the same overpowered cards. Example: I always get matched up with players who use Mega Knight and Magic Archers. Both of these cards are super OP and definitely need a nerf. It's really frustrating to play a game that's being structured to aid those who pay. Overall an unbalanced pay-to-win game that I would NOT recommend new players to download."", ""This is a amazing game. The patience you need in the game is amazing. The only reason I don't give it a 5 star is because you need pass royal to do alot of nice things. I get to get the best treatment you need money thing but some people don't really have money to pay for it. I just wish they gave commoners a better game experience. Also trading is annoying because you always need to have a trading token to trade and it's hard to get those. But over all an amazing game and highly recommend it."", ""Don't bother paying or playing. Played for 4+ years and can't take how rigged the game is. Nobody will admit, but when they want you to lose a game, you'll face some impossible to beat combination and they'll never make a mistake. Basically playing vs an AI opponent. They do this so they can limit the free rewards you earn by winning, and therefore require you to pay for cash rewards to progress your account."", ""I actually stopped playing for a while and I've just returned, just to discover that it has become way, way worse. Every single card that they have added is worse than the other, I get put against players who are times two from my skill level, and this is just the most sad thing I have ever seen. From the best mobile game this app has turned into a pile of trash, and I'm really sad to see this happen. I hope they can fix this, but in order for that to happen they need to remove every new update"", 'Good app but not for free to play gamers like myself.

Great work.', 'Not paying for another month of premium till you start changing things for the better. No innovation in game modes, same old ""this spawns on either side"".

I have won a fair bit of level 12's when I was level 9, but I'm seeing people who pay to play and max out their cards at level 13 and absolutely destroy other players. It's not fun to play.

Though trade tokens can really help F2P players, they still have to be willing to spend a lot of time on the game (I literally mean 5+ MONTHS) to acquire max level cards (let alone A FULL DECK).

Got to a decent rank then it slowly and steadily fell apart. I'm trying a different approach this time and so far appears to be working. Could I just say, Build, build, build up before expansion of the radar first. Current radar at level 6 or 7. 👍😁👍"", ""Awesome game, regularly updated and works flawlessly and its a great casual game, easy to spend just 5 min or 50 min in game. Have played it for many years since it first came out and its only gotten better with time. The Warships mode isnt for me personally, but I'm still glad they continually try to innovate and make the game better than it used to be. The play style is extremely flexible, literally a style for everyone, even the pacifist who doesnt like fighting, just harvest your resources."", ""update sucks! everyone you get paired up with is grossly better equipped than you are. totally unfair way they match you up with opponents.update. I posted this a while ago and this issue still hasn't been fixed, especially when you get a new engine room. I'm constantly getting matched up with people who are 4 or 5 spots higher than me on the upgrade tree."", ""It's a pretty fun game; I've been playing it for 2 years or so. It's a cute distraction. 6 months ago I the game would crash suddenly, saying that the server had become disconnected. And I would lose whatever progress I was making in a battle. Very frustrating. The developers should fix this glitch, or at least give us a win for every battle that we start before the system glitches out."", 'The game as a whole is ok. Unfortunately, the devs of late have been lapse. The gameplay of warship is unfair, you constantly get put against opponents that are far stronger and have unlocked warriors and abilities you do not possess, there is no way to win. I will no longer be playing the warship part of the game and will no longer spend any money on the game as a whole. Congratulations...', 'The game is fun but i wish we could play a mini game that would cost coins or gold. You would drop something and it the ball you dropped would collect points if it touched the point bubbles and whatever it adds up to would be the amount of time it takes away from what you are upgrading or the amount of time with training the soldiors.', ""You got a little better with the Warships, but still see the problem when i defeated another player's warship with a quicker time, and you still award them the victory. A new problem...Capt. Spark...I target a building with the flare, but when I try to hack that targeted building, it hack's something else. I know it can't hack special weapon buildings and buildings that can't defend themselves. FIX!"", 'So as you build the base it becomes exponentially difficult. If you use real money to get in game resources, your base can get destroyed and whatever money you are saving up goes away. That means, you may be trying to upgrade your buildings, units and you spend real money. You are going to be attacked before you can upgrade and then you just lose real money just to hand it over to a different player and robbed. Gonna contact my card company to get my money back.', ""I enjoy the original game, and like the idea of the warships portion of the game. Unfortunately the warship portion tends to be drastically mismatched and getting worse rather than better. I even stepped away altogether for a while over it. Hopefully you'll figure this problem out before I just delete the game from my phone completely."", 'very fun very fresh and very addicting. This game has so many different things about it that makes it a great game. My favorite is how easy it is to build a great base in such little time. There are no bugs, glitches, or crashing. This is a well-rounded encentric game and I recommend to anyone looking for some leisure time that is worth while or for anyone who wants to experience an action packed yet calming game.', ""FIX THE GLITCH! In the WarShip you are no longer able to win any chests. The ones down on the bottom left-hand corner do not count anymore when you win. They remain the same. I've lost so much reward from that glitch. I've uninstalled and reinstalled the application and i'm still not getting the reward. It's been about a month now without ANY reward."", ""Very fun but my only problem is I can't really. Enjoy my resource islands to the full extent I could've, three of mine are stale mates like permenantly I guess cuz they are lvl 4 while I'm already a lvl 31so idk if the other players quite the game or something but I wish I could fight someone back and forth for them again, kinda lost some charm in the game."", ""Warships is no good for seasoned players. I've played every season so far.. and it's impossible to get going. I and many others are just stuck throwing matches until we drop down to a reasonable level. And then what? We all just race to get the heavy helicopter? Wow.. that was fun at first, but it's really taken actual creative playing out of the game."", 'This game is AMAZING!!! It is so fun and omce you get to hq level 8 you can do so much and it doesnt take long to get there. There is so much to do too. You can join task forces (join mine its bombs awayyyyyyyyy) but you also have a alter base with all the best defenses and offesnes and you just battle and unlock rewards. And in task forces you start operations which everyone in the force works together to beat the 2-7 bases. I would defintly recomend this game.', ""It's fun, but has some issues. The first is that you can get attacked by people way stronger than you. I just got my base destroyed by someone 2 levels above me, they had zooka's and way more soldiers and I can't even attack them back when I have better stuff, they are just gone with 5 hours of base raiding worth of resources. Thank you, for ruining my day the second it starts, someone had to do it I guess"", 'It is not a bad game, but after awhile, it got boring. There was nothing really new and it almost was a chore, not a pastime or fun game. I almost feel bad about deleting it, and if you love strategy, it is for you! I am just not much of a strategy guy. EDIT: I have come BACK to the game and it is super fun with the addition of Warships! Nice job! They are adding new troops and keeping the game a bit more interesting. GLITCH: I destroy a Warships base 2 seconds before my opponent, and they win!', 'I loved playing this game and was in a GREAT task force until the update in December. Now I cant play it because when I open it, it closes and says"" unfortunately boom beach has stopped"". I\'ve tried uninstalling it and reinstalling it several times and it still does the same thing. I\'ve tried EVERYTHING!!!!! Thanks for taking the game away from me supercel', ""Enjoyable game with annoying bug - if I lose signal, even if I get signal back a few seconds later it won't let me actively continue the battle I am in, the battle just continues on its own. This is most annoying in warship if I lose signal before deploying troops as it means I automatically lose as I can't go back to the battle and deploy then - even when I get signal before the battle has finished. Not sure if this affects others too? Makes playing very frustrating in places with poor signal."", 'Best game ever but I purchased diamonds purchase went through but never received the diamonds and it is a hell of a task to email supercell to rectify the issue. They sent you to their Apple site which is really not any help just for this I am thinking of deleting the game. They need to work on their support system seriously', 'Every single time I try to get to rank 16 in the warship battle thing I always have people who destroy all engine rooms in less than 40sec and they all have everything unlocked while I cant even compete, this always happens when I get to about 10 stars away from rank 16. I lose 4 times in a row then have to try again. This has happened 4 times in the past hour.', ""This season's warship is by far the worst. I think maybe I destroyed 8 engine room's, after probably 60 to 70 attacks. Tried getting my 3rd engine to see if it got any better, but NO. At least last season, it was a race to see who could destroyed all the engine room's first. On a good note, the Mega Crab is great."", ""I've been playing for 3yrs now so take my word that If there was a 0 star rating i would have used it.Don't even bother downloading this game coz it sucks. Imagine a level 65 raiding a level 30. To can't even do nothing, you can't attach coz the map is full of players whose bases would crush your troops in seconds. Very unfair game. I advise you go and download a different game coz this one is just poor. Very poor game balance, giving the strong players and the pay to win guys a huge advantage."", ""Fun game until mid levels then the opponents become so hard. 10 to 12 levels higher then you. No way to defeat them. don't understand why they would make a game you can't play because your opponents are to high so your only choice is to shut it off and do something else. Seem counter productive. The game is unplayable at this point. just do not play for a few months to get your opponents back down to your level and I mean do not turn this game on for months."", ""Warships again become a farce. Rather than being about troop selection, tactics and skill. It again is just a case of who can fire their guns the fastest. Very disappointing again. Thought this would have been resolved as every previous season has been like this, but alas, this season is the same. It's just a waste of time playing the Warship side of the game"", ""I have been playing this game since maybe 2015, and it was great alllll the way up until NOW. This game is controlled in ways I never knew til now. I'm really starting to notice alot of weird things about this game. Warships is one, it's like no matter what i do and how fast i get done the opponent seems to ALWAYS win, it's RIDICULOUS!!!! With all that said I am gonna separate myself, because I don't feel like I'm getting a fair chance. So I HAVE TO uninstall."", ""I have enjoyed this game for over a year now. It's slow paced with lots of waiting for things to build but you can progress without spending money. The recent warships update is a huge letdown. You end up in some really frustrating loops where you just win and lose and don't progress. When season 2 started I went 1 win, 1 draw and 8 losses to start the season. Complaining will only get you canned but polite answers. It's an update that actually makes me want to play less. A waste of your time."", 'Good game but need alot of improvements, i got a draw acouple of times on the new battleships mode and how is that even possible when i have destroy the opponent and have even watch when opponent still has 1 engine to destroy and i still get a draw???! Needs to fix that getting anoyed with that', ""Great game, an upgraded alternative to Clash of Clans. I had this game before, but I re downloaded it. I recommend it to anyone who plays other Supercell games. However, I have a bug that stops new bases becoming available for me to attack and submarine dive spots don't appear as often as they should. Otherwise, great game. Keep up the great work Supercell!"", 'Chromebook support has been restored in the November update. Plus they have finally added additional levels for those of us who have been maxed out for the past three years. The game is alot of fun for those who are just starting out. It can be alot of fun even if you dont put money towards the game. Buying the instant troop for $10/month is a fun upgrade since it will allow you to really grind in the game.', ""Game bacome laggy. On entry and mid range devices (also older devices)the game play isn't as smooth as it is used to be. Unfortunately in the menu there is no option for reducing graphics. i recommend if you can't fix the situation at least put an option to reduce graphics for older or weaker devices. If this is not much to ask. I have 4 different devices that i can't play the game smoothly on them."", ""warships was a great way to expand the gameplay. And I enjoy watching my base grow stronger over time. Very intuitive and strategic gameplay. Supercell has a knack for doing extremely well in the app/mobile game industry . I only complain that I cannot get my Google play games to connect. But that's a personal issue and has nothing to do with the development teams amazing work and doesn't make the game any less enjoyable and fun."", 'This is a great game wish you could buy it. What a rip-off to want me there pay 99.00 dollars for fake crystals. I love this game but not the purchase part of none real items. Let me buy the game and find the things I need. My console game are not even 99.00 dollars. There is so many other ways that do this, it all the purchases not just the 99 dollar one. Thanks. Why do I lose progress on bases I can not defend', 'Game was good at one time. Now they try to make it almost impossible to defend to keep people playing. Instead of improving an equal part defense/offense, they launch warships which is terrible. Game used to be so fun. Now everything geared toward money. The new stuff getting too stretched. Sad to see it go. Task force players almost non existent anymore', ""The game is incredible well made, very entertaining but it is drown back by the thing that it's entirely pay to win. You can play free of charge but you need to be a veeeeery patient person and play for years to reach high levels. I understand that the developers needs to gain some money from this, that they don't work for free but in this game it's just ridiculous. The game its made in such way that it forces you to pay so you won't loose what you worked for such a long time."", 'Ive been playing for 5 years. It was fun, and very very addictive, which is the only thing that kept me going. This game is only for people who can spend money on premium currency. I cant, I wont. Boom Beach just wants your money, the developers always have these stupid offers, and i mean ALWAYS. In warships the matching system is ok, but when i destroy their engines or whatever before them, usually 10-20 secs, they still win. Cruel, and stressful. Dont play, if you cant pay. The devs dont care.', 'Loved this game for a while. Thought the new battleship idea would be awesome. Then i find out that the game and designers have no problem with cheaters. I brought it to the attention of the support group and all they said was, ""unfortunately we can\'t help you with that, contact us if you have questions regarding a different subject.... Genius....😒🙄', ""Love the game! Every improvement makes a big difference and a more rewarding experience. Thank you Creators of Boom Beach. Keep up the great work!!! Update#2... I had a rough time with the Warship game but I'm here to say I really like it! Every season is getting better. The only thing I have a problem with is the beggining when you have to fight with the infantrymen.its so hard to win with them. But all's well with boom Beach and I love it!!"", 'Without a doubt the worst season of warships. The fully upgraded rifleman, which used to be formidable, is now brought down by anything. The warrior wont go under tje smoke to a target and if he does defenses keep shooting like theres no smoke there. So i have troops that drop if u yell at them facing fully upgraded defenses. No way to win let alone destroy 8 engines to get upgrade tokens. Quit playin cause theres no point. I was an everyday player, a spend money player. No more', 'Great game, great graphics, gameplay is solid my only complaint would be for the warships that the date till the next worship is available would not be so long I like playing the worship as is. I feel that waiting about a week is too long.', ""This a great game of you are looking for some challenge and strategical game!! Whether playing on warship or in task force, there is always something to do. The only problem there is that it's hard to make changes to your bases, after you get new buildings. Please consider adding an edit mode where you can edit freely and easily.""]"

Next time you say something like this, at least do your research. Unless they have a time machine, they did not rip off clash of clans.', 'A Ripoff of a game called Clash of Clans. The original game is way better than this trash , it has bad graphics and the sharpness is very awful.

Dont waste your time in this knockoff trash', ""There are no notifications i have looked in the settings but there isn't any so you don't know when your upgrades have finished or when your troops have finished training but other than that it's a good game"", ""Jingle Heat game is very realistic.

You can't log in using 4G wifi networks also because this game is very fantastic with 3D graphics"", 'Time for upgrades is to long. The battle finder will put you up against unwinable opponents. You loose unused soldiers after battle. You cant control soldiers after putting them on the map. Monuments that give you small perks are upgraded at random you may even loose percentage ( loosing persantages is more common). There are to many currancies (Oil, gold, dimonds, biofuels) all which take time to harvest and upgrade. The only good thing is that you can get all currencies in game not just with real money but by waiting for harvesters or cleaning up your map. The time it takes in between battles is high and eventuly you hit a wall which only real money can overcome. All in all every aspect of this game is made to get you hooked then spend real money. Total time you can play with out having to use dimonds is 5-10 min then you have to retrain troops (training troops is how you get them) traning varies from base to base (perk monuments) and troop type. It will take 1- 2 hrs to replenish troops. Any troops not used in previous battle will be lost.', ""So I used to play this game all the time back in the day. I recently reinstalled it and have found it to be unbearable. It's definitely a pay to win game, but it seems to be even moreso now. Really though, the final straw was the recent update.

Lots of game modes to help players learn the ropes, level up and play their own way. The monthly sealed leagues and draft format level the playing field while your collection is small, and keep all of the cards you open. Very f2p friendly. Highly recommended.', 'This free-to-play really is as great as advertised.

I purchased a founders pack years ago so you can trust me when I say I know the game inside out.

I dont undsrstand how this happens.', 'This is a game with potential, however two stand out complaints drive me close to uninstalling on many occasions. First is deck composition rules: instead of flat number requirements like MTG (whose mana system eternal uses), eternal forces you to to have mana proportional/fractional to at least one third of your deck. This makes it highly likely you get hit by mana flood. The second is that out of all the digital CCGs eternal has an exceptionally bad shuffling algorithm.', 'its a great game, with tons of depth and a wonderful selection of janky cards for fun and semi competive off meta builds. The game does struggle with the issue of certain cards being pushed and power creep is certainly visable between sets. the games f2p model is generous and rewards daily play. all in all the game has faults but the many many benefits and positive aspects out way them.', ""This used to be a really good game, but the developers are ruining it with new broken game mechanics that basically allow players to circumvent the general gameplay strategy and coast to an easy victory with 2 or 3 cards...this is almost consistently done through the use of specific cards only unlockable through the new pay to win system. In other words, if you're not shelling out cash for cardpacks riddled with virtual mechanical cheats, then your win probability has plummeted with these added."", 'So first off, fun game. If you enjoy magic or hearth fire great game. However, it has a serious issue with ""shuffling"". I will go 10 games seeing the same cards from my deck. Not seeing many others. Or only seeing some once in awhile despite having copys in my deck. I will also go game after game drawing only power sigils. Or only monsters. How in a deck of 90 do I draw 10 power cards in a row??? Again it\'s fun. But there are days that it\'s very frustrating.', ""Every game is definitely not random card selection.

Love the incredible amount of different game modes and how you can play everything without spending a cent. Just amazing..', 'Game was fun until I realized that my favorite mode forge was completely rigged. The enemies have preset hands while you have to fight rng.

However, it quicky becomes apparent this game has nasty flaws. Given a review post limit, I cannot list them all. There is one however, I'd warn (unless you're one those cancerous people whom condone the effect) about. This game has a Mill-loss mechanic. Which for the victim of the Miller is little more then sitting back and watching the Mill player fornicating themself. Good idea, bad game implementation, with Auto-Win/Loss like that. 1/5"", 'Fun game. It is much more like MTG than hearthstone, but with enough differences to not be a copy of MTG. At first I was having a great time playing. Eternal has a lot of free gold and packs to earn. But, I was disappointed to see how many cards are only available from buying campaigns. It is possible to grind for the gold without purchasing, but the amount of gold needed for campaigns is very high.', ""Eternal is a fun CCG that has elements of both MtG and Hearthstone, but unique in its own way. Regardless what others are saying, you dont need to pay for card packs and expansions, as you can buy 'em with coins that you get at the end of every win.

I wholeheartedly recommend it."", 'Super impressed with this game. Great work.', 'One of the most underrated CCGs in my opinion. Feels like a perfect mix of the other popular Card Games on the market now plus has a more generous market structure. Very easy to go free to play and still hit high ranks. Highly recommend!', 'It\'s like the baby of MTG and Hearthstone, and sucks a little less. The ""lands"" you use to play spells is set up way better than MTG\'s, and it\'s pretty f2p. Also, I like how it seems a better system than MTG Arena. Deck creation is great, and they have a comperable amount of cards per set. Drafting is fun as well, and most other players have been incredibly nice during play. Great game, 11/10, will keep playing for sure. Will stop playing magic, too.', 'this is the best gaming app. the music is so so and the maps are kinda all dark colors,,but this is the best gaming app. you have more time to complete most games. you can make the games speedy if you like.', ""Epic helpful support team only wish is when I decide to take a brake I wish my missions could stack wish it took less space.... Advice for the devs in Deck view mode please add an option to clear the deck while in the deck view so we don't have to tap on every card to clear it"", 'Reinstalled game, and got back to playing. After playing long enough, got the feel how to counter flying decks. Now the only thing that makes me want to stop playing is, that more often than not you either get stuck with the power you had on your starting hand, or you end up drawing only power cards, both that ruin your game pretty spectacularly.', ""I don't really do comments, but this card game is amazing! I've been playing with CCG for ages and this game really deserves probably more than 5 stars well balanced and really generous as well.. Its basically a free game that you can grind and get cards you need plus playable on almost all platforms.

More choices for less expensive single player game modes would be nice and as a final positive I am really enjoying the deck builder, easy to jump right in and get building"", ""It's a great game but the deck shuffling is very unbalanced. It's always either too much power and not enough units or too many units and not enough power. I had a deck of 30 power and 45 units, weapons and spells. I minimized power because I was getting too many in a row but still have the same problem"", ""I gave this 5 stars when I first started playing. But now its become a pay to win game. There are certain insanely overpowered cards that you can only acquire if you spend the money for expansions. Buy a bunch of copies of the same card and then just build your deck around those cards. If you're going to penalize players that are just looking for a fair fun free game at least make it so that they can spend shards on the premium versions of the card. Its a shame its always about the money."", 'Incredible game straight from the desktop. A worthy contender to magic the gathering. Links to a central account so you can play from your PC or phone.

Money well spent!"", ""Loving it so far. Only issue is grinding to unlock the delve mode. Otherwise this is the most fun casual card game I've played in ages. Art style is fantastic, gameplay is fun and smooth and I'm hooked, line and sinker."", ""Everything is behind a paywall. Do not install. Literally every option you can choose from the main menu will lead to an obnoxious popup telling you to pay for something. Except trophies. That's literally the only one."", 'I think the game is a lot of fun but I wish the full version was either cheaper or they just flaunted the please pay us a little less. And I am of the opinion the game without the full version is plenty entertaining, so the seemingly constant ask to purchase for over half the game is redundant.', ""It's a good game, but there's a pretty big paywall. You're restricted to: having 10 ability cards unlocked, normal mode, and other features unless you pay $5. I don't have money. There's a reason I'm looking for free games :/ it's not their fault though, they need to make money somehow."", ""Really fun game, although the tutorial could use a ton of work- you have to figure out the bulk on the different areas and advancement on your own. Also I'm not sure what is broken but I unlocked some quest items like being able to change the dealer, and it's not actually changing it in the game :( big de-motivation to keep playing if they can't fix the quest prize. Will update rating when the advancement goals are fixed again"", 'Like michael corrigan, i also payed for this game, got a new phone and lost all my progress and truly interesting cards. I still play it from time to time but the loss of the higher up cards was devastating and ruined the game for me. That being said, it was fun enough for me to purchase it, which i never do.', ""Great game overall. Love that it's a one time purchase. I want the decision making to be harder and more varied, but overall it's enjoyable, light entertainment and I'm glad I bought it."", ""I am interested in the idea of this game, and the system seems smooth, but there is a constant robotic humming modulation of all sounds. I use a OnePlus 7 Pro. I'm guessing it's not the normal sound, but it occured first time using the app. Really tainted my experience so far."", 'Easy to learn, but with enough card variety to add difficulty, strategy, and the desire to collect unlockables. The artwork is very nice as well.', 'I love this game!!!! I love this game as much as I love Miracle Merchant and Card Thief! I paid for the full version app for Card Crawl and I play this game every single day! Keep up the good work❤️', 'All around good stuff. Good art direction and design. Unique gameplay. I love playing while wearing headphones because it offers some relaxing tavern ASMR while you play lol...', ""I love this game! One of the few awesome offline games you can play and completely repayable. My only request is they make more goals for the player to go for (I've gotten them all)"", ""This game isn't F2P it's just a simple demo/shareware most of the features/options are behind a paywall, that's not necessarily a bad thing but it should be in the description. BTW in my device (mobile telephone) the sound/music are completely broken."", 'Fun game, but I\'ll echo the common sentiments of most of the game being ""paid"". What\'s worse, you literally cannot unlock the paid features when you have Google PlayPass because it removes in-game purchases.', 'I really enjoy this game! I like how there are different ways to play, and that I can play for more coin even though I don\'t ""lose"" often.', ""I would give it 5 stars, however because of my screen set up I can't see my coin total so I'm never sure how much I have. But that's my only complaint, otherwise it's super fun and just the right amount of challenging."", 'Don\'t get me wrong. It\'s a great, fun game. I would totally recommend for my friends EXCEPT by the fact that the game is not free, but hidden behind a ""free game"" disguise. I really hate to download a game and after a few matches receive the message ""Surprise! The game\'s not free and you need to buy to continue playing!"". I love the game, but hate the marketing choice.', 'Amazing vector graphics and art style. Love it. Some of critique: Animations can be made shorter for the snappier feel of the gameplay.', ""Fun and enjoyable! I have played a few of his games and they don't dissapoint! Very unique and they do a great job explaining how to play. Awesome artwork. The creators and developers should be proud!"", ""A nice core concept, but lacks depth. Different monsters that have special effects (Can't be targeted by spells, can't be blocked by shields, etc.) would help add some depth to the otherwise basic number crunching. Additionally, you have no idea what RNG picks the game will give you for ability cards. Some, Shield Bash, can solo win an entire run, while others only serve to increase your score, and a few can even get you killed!"", ""Pretty good game, although I would prefer to know when a 'free' game is actually a demo for the paid game. Don't get me wrong, I am all for paid games when they are worth it, but prefer to know it before I download them. Aside from that, everything is awesome and enjoyable."", 'Fun game without worrying about running out of content. Completely worth the $5! The free version is just a taste of all the content that comes with the full version.', 'A very easy-to learn card-ish game, Card Crawl uses the theming of a dungeon crawler, and the limitations of a (modified) deck of cards to create a compelling game of risk and reward, where the pursuit of a high score means gambling on disposing of valuable resources. While the RNG will occasionally lead to impossible-to-win runs, the quick turnover from session to session, and steady progression of fun and brain-teasing card unlocks keeps the grind from feeling onerous. Highly recommended.', ""Game was excellent up until recently. Only issue that I'm having now is that the sounds and music have been replaced with a continuous robotic hum. This issue persisted through and uninstall and a reboot so it may be device specific. I'm using a OnePlus 7 Pro. If this issue is fixed rating will go back to 5*."", ""I want explanations for everything aside from the main gameplay, but even so, I'm hooked! It's quick, clever, and looks great. I love the art."", ""It's okay. Pro tip you'll have to take damage from high hitting monsters. None of the weapons (from what I've played so far) can slay 9 and 10 hp monsters in one hit. Take the damage from big monsters and use swords and shields to take out low hp monsters. Recommend keeping a high level potion in your backpack til the last 10 cards in the deck."", ""Very fun. It's not for RPG fans, but for fans of card games it will provide enjoyment in bursts of perfect length for a phone game."", ""Fun game. Sound is all digitized and can't listen to it. Have to mute everything. Update 12/23/19: still digitized, but not in Bluetooth mode."", ""I really enjoy the game but after a lot of hours spent on it I wish there was a little more to it, I've been trying to unlock the other two heroes but it's taking so damn long! Always playing with the regular knight can get a bit stale in the long run. But I really love the artwork and music and general feel of the game!"", 'Nice concept, easy to understand while also sometimes challenging If I had to say something negative about the game it would be that some ability cards seem fairly useless', 'Easy to play but fun enough to hold my interest. I like that there is unlimited gameplay without a bunch of ads.', 'Great game. Cheap for lots of additional content if you get bored.']"

Leave a review or contact our Customer Support by visiting http://www.withhive.com/help/inquire.","[""Its CCG and gatcha, and yet its unique, fun, and there's a lot of freebies and events that whaling is not a necessary component to play. I love the art. It does take a while to build good teams, and can be a bit overwhelming at first. The reason for this is that there is a lot of variety in play styles and team comps. But once you have some solid teams for farming and slightly harder game content, theres always more challenges in PvP. Put those thinking caps on, strategy matters in this game."", ""I've been playing this game for more than a year now. All I have to say is, if my account ever got reset/deleted I honestly wouldn't even be mad because I would just be able to everything all over again. Such as, the feeling of getting my first free 6 star or the feeling of accomplishment everytime my team's power rank goes up. Especially when I reached L rank. I just love this game."", ""Bunch of BS. Took about 1 hour 30 minutes to download data needed to start game and then once I download data it closes all my background running apps and when I login it tells me I need to choose a nickname, but keyboard doesn't work and a nickname is required to create my account. Don't download this if you wanna waste an hour of your time."", ""If you want a game where the Devs don't care about you then this game is for you, lackluster content, plagued with latency issues and overall terrible game balance, also worth mentioning there are roughly 250 players that the game devs don't care about which are every 2-4 star player in the game. In closing the only amazing thing about this game is how long it has lasted so far which as this review is 5 years..."", ""Super great game, and i have been playing it for 4-5 years, with some breaks on and off. But very good game, but only bad thing is that it crashes sometimes, but not as often as you'd think."", ""Why would you make a game that only crashes every time you want to download files. The game itself looks fun but if you can't even get past the download stage then it isn't worth the damn time you waste. Im friggn done with this sht. I'm going to search for a game that actually works!"", ""EXTREMELY pay to win. There are some skins you can't get without shelling out $100. Hard pass, pun intended. Minue the pay to win aspect, it's still a pretty fun game. (EDIT) They've gotten better at freebies and there's usually an event going on which is nixe, still salty about the $100 skins but oh well"", 'why this game downloading so SLOW!! 300mb additional data feels like downloading 2.5gb file. my connection is just fine in other game downloading 350mb++ didnt take more than 5 minute. in this game just 1% taking time more than 1 minute WTH!', 'A game worth putting time an effort in. Entertaing and so many vários teams that you can make. I have played for two years and have not lost intrest.', ""Been playing global since server opened and tbh i'm happy with the game and how the devs have been making little positive changes all around over time, would recommend! *join global server best server*"", 'This is the only game that I played for years. I easily get bored but not in this game. I love the developer and the changes everytime. Thank you!', 'What the hell is wrong with this game?? After selecting the server, it always said connection lost no matter server i choose. After a long time download and that is what i get.', ""The connection often lost even though my internet connection is fine. Please fixed it and I'm gonna give you 5 stars."", 'It is a fun anime soccer game. I love the art and gameplay.', 'Hard to stay motivated playing but still a really good game but legendary players are far to hard to get like ridiculously low rate', 'There is an error in pvp.. after the pvp finishes, the screen freezes and it sucks', 'i dont bother with broken and unbalanced trash game anymore .no new content just bunch of stupid new character superb boss are just plain and completely stupid broken way too unbalanced..', ""The event is so great and i already got 4 legendary player with only draw without using topup crystal Also i'm a returning player."", 'Pls increase ur character draw rates. How is it i drew almost 10 times (10+1 draws) and i receive not even one 5 star player and less than 10 four star players?', ""Very Fulfilling I've been playing this game for years and I have never had a dull moment playing it!"", 'every time i try to download the info it gets stuck on my computer and does not download', 'I like the game but i dosent feel satisfying at all. And somthimes it freezes. Plz do somthing. Tks.', 'Aite first of all, look at all these whiny sons of bishes giving the 1-2* review and complaints abt smallest stuff and since i played this for almost five years f2p heres my review. First of all no matter what game it is theres always difference between the one who paid for stuff and play for free and the fact that the f2p want to have the same as p2p is just plain retarded, second yeah the legendary rate is quite unfair playing f2p for almost 5 years i only have 4, third is pvp is all about ME-', ""It was great all the way tbf but one thing that frustrating me is your guide quest especially for long pass. I ranked 50+ already and I thought to pass and try it again soon as finish the chapter. Now, I'm finished and I'm struggled to do that guide. Was it supposed to be enemy first move? Could you change the possibility? I hv done so many ways yet I still can't use long pass. Thank you. EDIT: I passed. I took long enough xc"", 'Never stuck to an app game for so long. since 2014. In my experience, I didn\'t have to pay to play to advance. Eventually for really addicted and invested into the game. But never have I regretted spending money and later feeling bad or as if I lost something. Will continue to play even if I take a break every now and then. Would 100% reccomend to those who are more drawn to these ""type of games"". P.s would love if they could improve the club system so we can have more contact with each other.', ""This game is absolutely horrible with balancing players. Early on the game may seem good, but when you get to the PVP aspect of the game it's horrible. The flaws really show with the current state of the game. You will run into the same teams on Gold League that you should be able to beat. But guess what? EVERYONE runs a mono legend team with OHKO or just uses a Thor ace with her broken passives. This game really needs a huge patch with just balancing. Oh, they also have a Zombie loop in pvp!!"", ""Please do something about the package sales popup. Everytime enter the game, it always appear and it's really annoying and eyesore. 27/11/2019 server maintainence taking so long. If calculated, 10hour total maintainence. I wanna play, don't wanna see time countdown. (¬_¬)"", 'To be honest the game was fun at first when I initially installed it. The people who are responsible for the art and the trailers of this game have my admirations. Game wise it is acceptable considering you can go auto in the story mode and host to gain additional players while you are away of the game. Statistic wise the legendary players are difficult to get but not impossible. If you gather crystals and tickets and await for the percentage to go up in draw you might get one. Patience is key.', ""This game is no longer in a state worth playing. It's gotten to the point it is just releasing a new OP character, and then two weeks or a month later there is a Nerf and possibly another new OP character released as a hard counter. This process has just been repeating over and over again with no stop in sight. The company is just trying to milk this game as much as it can at this point. There was a time it was worth playing... There was a time..."", ""I like tactical games, and this is one of them, however, prices for skins, crystals, etc are quite a big sum that most other games that have a similar system don't charge as much, but if you like soccer/football, and/or tactical games, this is an alright game."", ""I really liked the game but now I started to hate it. I spent around 4000 crystal and I didn't get a single legendary player how can that be. There are teams full with legendary players how is that possible. Its either that the game is full of hack or there is a huge problem with the game. I am really disappointed."", 'Since last update, cannot play the game without WiFi, saying unstable network... It worked fine before that update.... Beside that, grindy game but interesting concept.', 'Played for 5 years at 1st the game was fun then the P2w stuff became more unbearable. You have to hab a 6* char (dalgi) for you to even have a chance, balancing is trash i might quit because no longer find this game fun but more of a grind (gatcha is trash 0.002% for a 6*) if your f2p stay away... (i hate the meta of this game its all the same boring stuff)', ""I'll write a proper review in like an year from now, that's about the average speed it takes for this game's developers to do anything that isn't trying to milk whales"", 'The game is difficult to play competitively because of p2w, but the game is lenient to how you can achieve greatness with persistence. Good events monthly and updates as well.', ""Gameplay and story is enjoyable. I having fun playing this game. But gacha rate is very bad. Overall it's fun game but don't get your hopes high for legend cards because it's soo hard to get."", ""I don't know why but somehow it's not letting me play anymore. It loads until the opening where you choose the servers but when I click the screen to load my game, it always closes/crashes. What's the point of keeping it if I can't even play. 😭"", ""Look I like the game but now as soon as I launch the game I immediately just get stuck on the home screen and no its not frozen the cinematic is playing but that's all that it's doing nothing else I've tried restarting the app but that doesn't work"", ""Great! Sadly it can become boring or Grindy but at least it was potencial to do the Game without major costs 'cause it is indeed a Gacha. So if you don't like Gacha you wont like that much this game. Also Buff Lab Rat Rabian pls!"", 'Download 350 MBs update at super slow speed']"

Full patch notes: www.playhearthstone.com","[""Where do I start, I know how about the loading screen. You'll spend more time there than playing the actual game. Constantly being disconnected all the time, then having to restart the app just so it can happen again. Real fun, good times. This the third try I gave this game over the years, well no more. If you value your time don't bother."", 'Great game, truly. I have a lot of fun playing it even if a lot of people love to deride it. However, the Android app is absolutely awful. Seriously. Awful. It crashes sometimes I guess, but for the most part it just ends up unresponsive at loading screens. Like half the time that I open the app it hangs and I have to stop the process and open it again. It is incredibly frustrating. It also will have bizarre visual glitches at similar times, like corrupted NES stuff.', ""In short, this game is fun, but it does require some patience. The devs update the game a lot, but they are very slow when it comes to balancing the game. This is most prominent in modes other than the standard playmode. The wild format hasn't been balanced in months, with one strategy dominating the mode for over a year. The new battlegrounds playmode doesn't get much balancing often either. If you want to have fun, this game is good, but you will need to be patient to play competitively"", ""I've been playing HS since the first launch of the game. But lately the game keep updating something without any prompt, and apparently it disconnect the game, when i reconnect, i was considered lost to my last game. Happened so many times, and it's so frustrating (especially when doing Arena runs). Graphics glitches and game freeze many times since the last expansion update. One more thing, why it took so long to start the game? Is there nothing you can do to make it connect and load faster?"", 'Why is the galaxy note pen bug still a thing, 4 months after the patch that generated the issue?! I feel like there is 0 attention given to this. You acknowledged it only after a month since it started, on your forum; then in the only oficial update you gave you were stating that you guys reproduced it (like it was some realization, i mean just run the game on a galaxy note and try dragging a card), that it looks like an engine issue that takes a lot of time to fix, and that you investigate.', ""When moving from area with WiFi to 4g signal, the app has to close and reopen. Sometimes it doesn't register you've a game in progress until you hit 'play' and then resets again. By the time you make it back into game you've missed 1 or 2 turns making it pointless to continue. Otherwise, loving the new game mode."", 'I have been playing this game for many years now. As of this post, hearthstone is in one of the best places it has ever been. There are many modes to play and some that require zero collections. Conisder playing this game, it is by far the best card game on the store. It is not pay to win. Does it take time to build a good deck if you are F2P, it does but it not hard. I know numerous F2P players who have multiple viable decks.', 'This is by far the best rating on any game I have ever getting on a review. Blizzard\'s ""Hearthstone"" gets 5 Stars across the board for all the right reasons! The gameplay is fun and engaging, multiple heroes are very fairly balanced as well as the corresponding cards for each hero. Two says this game is pay-to-play would be unfair oh, of course like any other TCGit\'s going to cost money to buy booster packs, however I\'ve never purchased a booster and am a formidable opponent if I say so myself!', 'Like other reviews have said, the game hangs on the loading screen for awhile. Seems like they could spread that out a bit by not loading as much as soon as you start the game. Also, making it so that you can leave the app and come back without reopening the whole thing would be great.', ""I started playing this game since Whisper Of The Old Gods expansion which was in 2016 until now. This is the only mobile game that lasted for many years in my phone app. The down side is that Blizzard is a money hungry company which I notice how their expansion and card set became too expensive as the year goes by. They became too greedy with their sales. I used to buy cards before when it was in a good reasonable price. Now it's just ridiculously expensive."", ""I highly recommend this game, its my favourite card and that says alot, since i have play over 100 card games. Its simple, easy to learn great for beginners and new to card games. There is a new card set every 4 months and old sets rotate out every year, in standard there are 7 cards sets for 9 different classes and a basic set of cards everyone gets for free, earning in game money isn't to hard, of course you can choose to buy packs but its not necessary to play the game."", ""Tough to get started when you have basic cards and everyone has stacked decks with legendary everything but it's quite gracious with the amount of card packs it gives you early on. Also the crafting mechanic allows you to get some of the stronger cards without having rng in the way. Matchmaking is rough early on so 3 stars until noobs get matched with noobs"", 'Takes about a full year (maybe two) of playing daily (or every other day) before it really begins to feel like a ""free to play"" game. If you strategize over months, you can get a decent selection of cards to work with for free. Sometimes you trick people into letting you win but usually not. The solo adventures are pretty great. Highly addictive and extremely time consuming. Fun game!', ""Been playing since 2014 (basically since launch), and the continuous expansions and updates always keep the game feeling new. I was new to Blizzard games and didn't know about WoW characters or lore, but then I began playing WoW because Hearthstone made it so interesting. The port on mobile and tablets is also one of the best ports ever for a PC game. The only problem I have is there should be more hero portraits, Magni, Medivh and other heroes should come back to the store."", ""Overall this is a 5 star game, one of the best on mobile, but players are allowed to have strong and cheap decks from the start. These decks aren't those combo styled decks but just super agressive decks that most can't deal with. I just hope that the developers can ever so slightly improve the meta. This is supposed to be a strategic card game, not some no brainer agressive play style. Yes, its use of in game mechanic but it's extremely unskilled"", 'Pros: lots of modes, lots of cards, single and multiplayer modes,ladder system for some modes, warcraft themed Cons: the new player experience could be better, bad reward system. The overall cost of the game is high., no card trading. Some modes are to punishing to new players.', ""Love the game but... During solo play, I usually have no trouble reconnecting to games once the app has closed however it won't ever reconnect to boss fights, sometimes these fights can take 30 minutes or more to finish and I have to do them all in one go or it resets me back to the start of the battle, absolute nightmare for heroic mode"", ""New players must dump money into card pack to be able to compete. Card sets expire as new sets release meaning the grind never ends without real improvement. Other modes exist but 90% the same thing with slight changes, some locked behind paywalls also locking card sets out. One game mode is only worth playing until you win the free pack (which is a classic pack, you'll eventually just have all those cards and the pack is worthless) and one mode is an extremely poorly optimized beta."", ""Fantastic game that will keep you entettained for years. There's plenty of different game modes and characters/cards to suit your style of play. It rewards you for doing a good job and trying everyday with different quests. People complain that it costs money to play which sure thats a bummer but what great games are free?"", ""The AI cheats in solo play. I'm just a starting player but even on the easy challenges the AI is way too tough to beat. It's assumed that a good AI in the computer already can create perfect card ratios in the deck, will have better cards initially, and will calculate the best time to play any of those cards. But that is somehow not enough. The AI in addition will have many more copies than two of a cards, it will have more cards in their deck and more life. What the hell. This game is garbage."", ""I love this game but its super slow. The developers seem to have tried to update it so much and cram so much content in that it just takes an absolute age to load. It's almost unplayable. Sometimes i'll try to load it and give up after 5 minutes of waiting and play something else. It's such a shame because it's such a great game otherwise"", ""I'll be honest, I only started playing a few days ago. The only reason I'm even playing this game is because Gwent The Witcher Card Game has not been released on Android which I think is stupid because it's been on stupid iOS for months now. Anyway I don't like Blizzard Entertainment but I really wanted a CCG and not an Anime one so this is it till Gwent is finally released. I have Hearthstone on my iMac and, when I play this game I prefer the actual computer version."", 'The game was great but now they are doing just like Warcraft 3 Reforged. They put out a garbage expansion, which was just a money grab and completely unbalanced the game, so that you\'d have to pay for more cards to switch from the last ""best class"" which is now trash. Blizzard is just going downhill.', ""Great game, but buggy app. It's pretty frustrating that I have to constantly deal with the app freezing, crashing, and repeatedly disconnecting from the server. There is no excuse for this from a company that can definitely afford to fix it."", ""This app has so many problems. Aside from the obnoxiously long start up and reconnection times (assuming you are even able to reconnect to your game) it will also randomly disconnect you and/or black screen. Don't waste your money on arena. If you want to play this game do so on a pc."", 'Please for the love of god, fix optimization for android devices on Battlegrounds. It runs incredibly slow and laggy while every other game mode runs absolutely fine. The timer in the tavern is never consistent and every action is slow. Also, why does the desktop client get resolution and other graphic options to make the client run faster but android gets no such thing? Once again a Blizzard game falls flat cause of no simple quality of life changes. Other than this, good, addictive gameplay.', ""Easy to pick up and play compared to other card games but still very challenging. You don't need to have the latest cards to do well. Most of the cards are self-explanatory although you would have to research actions like inspire, rush, invoke, etc. It has recently improved alot. Newcomers to the genre will find it more enjoyable than the more complicated card games out there. Blizzard keeps it fresh with extra modes modes and campaigns to help keep it from being stale."", ""So many years Hearthstone cannot fix random crashes on Android phones especially on lower ranks.

My only gripe about the games is the hand holding in the early stages. I wish we were able to level up the towers earlier in the game. Instead of waiting four stages in. But this game is phenomenal with the addition of your chosen hero having a unique ability you can use at your leisure which is a nice to use in a tight spot. Overall, you should buy it if you liked the other ones', 'I started following Kingdom Rush (2011) on chrome webstore and since then I have been a huge fan of Ironhide studio games. I have purchased all their games and have been playing them constantly whenever I need a good adrenaline rush. This game is amazing in terms of strategy, your hand eye coordination, instant decision making under pressure. There is no comparison in terms of difficulty among all the KR Saga since all of them are equally challenging and test you to the limits.', 'This game, in my opinion is the worst of the series. But even being the worst, it is still better than almost any other tower defence game out there. So many little easter eggs and references to movies and other games...such a great game would recommend buying but only if you have bought the other games first, Kingdom rush, Kindom rush Frontiers, and Kingdom rush Vengeance', 'I really like these games but the reason for 4 stars is it is really similar to the last one. I was hoping for something different but keep the same type of concept. Maybe add more components to the game or something.', 'This is a big upgrade from the first two kingdom rush games and feels much more refined and fun than the previous ones.The difficulty and strategic gameplay is still maintained very well and the heroes feel more like heroes and less like lieutenant troops from an army with the hero upgrade tweaks.Overall,a must try for strategy game lovers!', ""The most enjoyable strategy tower defense game experience I've ever had. Been following Ironhide Games Studio for almost a decade and over half my current lifespan and I have to say that these games will always leave you satisfied, they have incredible personality and a special place in my heart. Thanks for my favorite KR game, Origins is a gem 👌"", 'i realy enjoy playing this game i never thought i enjoy playing another tower defence game but its chalenging beutiful backgroud excellent game play i wish it could turn to big game like wow good job guys but one thing between kingdom rush and origin there were lack of creativity in structure pattern and balancing towers i mean i expect more from u guys this is the only game i paid to play plz countinue the good work btw should buy vengence ?anyone play it?,plz comment if it worth it', 'Brilliant game overall, but the amount of additional content that must be purchased is somewhat of a joke. The game is free to play but several heroes must be purchased additionally. I would happily pay £2 - £3 for the game and have all content available.', ""It's very satisfying and I enjoy how much time passes without me noticing I would recommend this for people who would like to indulge in a game that would engage your meditative side, and in return for time spent the reward will be incredibly satiating"", 'This was a great addition to the kingdom rush genre. This one is not only a great addition it is also much more difficult but the difficulty increases gradually instead of exponentially like the original frontiers.', ""In my last review I stated there were no microtransactions, that was an error because there are microtransactions. They are not needed and the game is still fun. (I couldn't edit my last review.)"", 'THANKS FOR NOT BEING GREEDY! one of the very few games that are actually FREE and GOOD ! the devs have not designed it to be unplayable for free. As a result I didnt feel forced into purchases and made them anyway in good will to support the company. Brilliant game ! Thanks', 'I think this is a great addition to the Kingdom Rush game series and have an amazing story plot. Everything seems great! Good job Ironhide Studios.', 'One of the very best Android strategy games I have ever played. Totally fan of the studios and the series. Very addictive and enyaging.', 'Builds on the previous games and delivers equally. The heroes are expensive like the previous games but you are given 5 free heroes and they are more than enough to complete the game and enjoy it to the fullest. 5/5.', 'This games difficulty is scaled way too high even on the casual setting. The previous two games it was a nice challenge but still possible to 3 star the missions. In this game, with all towers built and maxed, its barely possible to pass some missions.', ""I've always loved the Kingdom Rush series. I played the first many times, got the 2nd a couple months ago and now this and I don't regret a thing. Keep the series going!!"", ""I like the game just as much as normal kingdom rush. Great gameplay and a tad more difficult. The hero's you can get like Prince Denas and Vez'nan are amazing. But they are too pricey."", 'Fun, came here after playing one if the others. Has some new features, with the same good tower defense features.', 'Great game. Kingdom Rush is still dominating the tower defense game industry. I love this game. Never gets old and is always the best. Keep up the good work!', ""Not the best I would say, it's a good game, story wasnt all that great, and the enemies and towers were just all over the place, great soundtrack, and gameplay."", 'Did not work at first but i deleted and reinstalled it and it worked fine. Not my favorite game of the series but still very good. I dont know why the heroes are so much more expensive in this game than in the others though.', 'More of the same ( having played original and frontiers ). Different venues though, with smooth controls. Worth a buy ( if you know what you like ) at the right price.', 'Great little fun game the graphics and comic book like cut scenes and great story I cant complain honestly, and the maps have little things to interact with', ""Pros: Good game w/ decent graphics Cons: Pricey game. (I recommend not investing any money in this game so you don't regret it in the long run) I finished the game and it didn't save my data. Other people are complaining about pricey Heros and gems which are true. The most you can spend on the Heros was something around $6.99 which is outrageous. Please don't buy anything extra! I buy Prince Denas and realized that I don't want him and pass the policy for 10 day refund. (I didn't know at all)"", 'Feels like guessing which tower types will work this time instead of strategizing. Especially when starting a new level. Eventually just feels like a chore to play', 'I love Kingdom Rush, this extands the fun of playing it, but the app crashed on me several times. Development team?', 'Always good fun. The pinnacle series for defense games. This fits the mold.', ""The Kingdom Rush games are some of my favorite tower defense games because of their artwork and the way that the games progress as you play through them. I also like the challenge that they start to add once you get the hang of the towers and how best to try to use them. As for the in app purchases in the game they are not needed to win and I am not sure why so many people say that they are. So all in all if your into strategy games I'd say to give this one a try."", 'I bought the 5.99 kingdom rush game and it really seemed like pay to win. Ive rebeat this game a few times and its always enjoyable.. fair yet challanging, fun, and no NEED to spend money. Id rather pay 20 bucks for a game upfront then be tricked into needing to pay to win. Please go back to making games like this one and frontiers... pretty please', 'Great game played it through multyple times and it is as fun everytime.The heroes also are rearly fun and make the game just a bit easier if you are finding the game too difficult.', 'Love all the Kingdom Rush games. They are my favorite tower defense games. Still having fun replaying the campaigns after many times through each.', 'This game is so much fun! Would recommend it to anyone! That background music is also great. Nothing much to say just awesome!! 10/10', 'Game advertisers more things to buy a soon as you start the game even though I have just paid for it no support for widescreen on Xperia 5 and achievements do not unlock if you are offline', ""It's a good tower defense game. I like the new spell and hero spells. The new designs for towers look better to."", 'I enjoyied all 3 kingdom rush games and im just now learning that there is another one so that makes 4 KR games and im excited to play it, but it KR Vengenge costs money so i have to get a job so i can pay for it.', 'A high fantasy skin for kingdom rush with new voice lines for the towers, still sticks to the same 4 tower functions, if you like the kingdom rush series this is more of the same.']"

The gameplay is simple and addicting but on a limited time and attention. However, it's still fun with the urge to unlock the next ship. Controls? Tablet/smart phone controls are way better than on PC/Laptop. But keep it up devs! It's a recommendation for me."", ""Fantastic space sim. I've played similar games, but this one is probably one of the best of its kind. Smooth, smart and built for casual and hardcore gamers alike. It's surprisingly addictive with a lot of customization features and superb art design and direction. 10/10"", ""Love playing Battleship s*** playing space battleships love adding new guns airplanes and stuff to it making them upgrade. This is a great game. I think anybody who wants to start first playing Battleship like this. She like it. Don't get him. Keep it up guys do one that's free though. Like absolutely free. For the people who don't have the money."", 'I really enjoyed the game as far as playing and options, but the amount of time it takes to earn the ships is insane. I am an adult with a job and do not have that kind of time to work on that ship list one at a time. I woul not reccomend buying this unless you can save up for the ship you want. Fun at first, but then turned into a painful grind.', 'Personally really really enjoyed the game, defo got my money worth. Drawback is probably no other modes available, limited to 3 ships and takes a while to unlock new ones, however from my understanding the developer had to focus attention elsewhere to avoid bankruptcy.', 'Been playing this game since 2016, it never disappoints. I would like a way to craft high end weapons and ships (or improve shielding/Hull) because there is always a point in the game when it is impossible to kill before being killed.', ""Great little game, had me hooked. The game play loop wasn't too bad and there could be more variation with the weapons and how they perform, but overall a great purchase."", 'Worst game ever experienced. Starting battles are impossible with no apparent way to upgrade your ship or earn resources or experience in order to get strong enough to do so. Difficult can be fun, but not as much when you first start. Edit: nice try devs. i started the game dozens of times. i tried out every one of the turrets available with the starting credits. offensive turrets, shield emmitters, fighters, and even purchasing the wingman vessels in different variants for extra fighters or just shooty escorts. the first few enemies still wipe the floor with the player ship or ships, usually in seconds. the one time i managed to win the first fight, the reward in resources made what is generally called ""a pittance"" look like riches. i\'ve been looking for years for a spaceship game where i start with a ship, upgrade it, enhance it, fly around, and then work towards a bigger better ship to fly. i thought this might be it, but i was wrong and my search continues...', 'I cannot wait for the release of space haven, thus why im replaying this game although it does eventually get repetitive, its still fun discovering tactics to take out the worst of enemies', 'Almost got in on the kickstarter when it was called FTL, actually got it years later because the concept sounded cool, and it is a cool little game, like a simpler space version of nethack.', ""Very impressive first look. Mechanics of ships are good. Good for short play times. Needs improvement on tutorial. May be difficult at start. Lacks replayability. Farming to win with little to no strategy once you've figured out the game."", ""It's a great game, the best battlevoid game so far! I have no complaints and it definitely deserves five stars"", 'This is the best game of battlevoid verse pls update it more frequently and add some more levels and sandbox mode where we can have 5 or 6 ships and thanks.', ""Good games, good reply value, but and that's a big but, the difficulty level is very high, Normal is very hard. Clearly the difficulty level is there to stretch the length of the game."", ""this is a fun time killer, the only thing that bothers me is the fact you CANNOT carry over your fleet from one level to the next! What's up with that? That sucks! spend all the time to build your fleet only to have ripped away on the next level. Another thing way can't you bank your scrap in order to help build your ship up so you can fight the enemy. Thinking about uninstalling because hate having to start over and over again."", 'I am really enjoying this throwback to old school space games. This is not to easy and requires some thought and just enough strategy to add depth. Well worth the money.', ""Great game, well worth the money! I like the challenge level, keeps it interesting. I've read the other reviews, and have a notion that would solve most people's main gripe. (Mine too.) I'd like to see a way to save your progress, at least between maps on a level. It can get very frustrating to take the time to fight your way to the third or fourth map, then lose it all due to one unfortunate battle! And have to start all the way back at the begining again! C'mon guys!We're not paying quarters."", ""Annoying AF. You can get through 2-4 maps, no problem. But then, inevitably, you will hit a map that you clear until the last system, which will be crawling with enemy ships. Forget that you have 50,000 credits to spend, your HQ ship will get destroyed and you have to start over. And again, forget that you have 50,000 credits...advanced ships remain permanently locked. I guess this is supposed to be..what...strategically challenging? It isn't. It's just annoying. Sad. An otherwise beautiful game."", ""It's a really good game, worth the money. Lots of fun different play styles, but the only issue is the scoring. It sucks to have just filled your fleet with the best ship and gear available and to have very little scrap left, just to get merc'd and your score plumetting due to scoring being based mainly on scrap on death, how many places discovered, and what sector you're on. It's still a solid game, but it's very annoying to get further than a previous game by far, but get a score as if you died right off the bat... still worth the money though."", 'the game is good. however the enemy is a little overpowered. and as you progess thru the first 3 lvls, the ships you unlock cant even come close. random map creation can create black holes and asteroid fields for 2 to 3 tiles in a row. which is bad cause it disallows your fleet to repair. and if the enemy decides to follow. its game over real fast. which isnt cool at all. that needs to be fixed. actually give us a chance to survive.', 'At one point i found this game incredibly hard, but it was still enjoyable, am still waiting for the latest game to be released (space haven for those who dont know)', 'I really enjoyed this game. Pros: great replay value, ability to add different weapons to ships. Cons: while you can unlock a lot of ships, most are junk. ship control is minimal, and only exists to move you closer to the target. the only strategy is choosing what quadrant to warp into in each sector.', ""Great little space RTS that you can spend a few hours on over the course of a week here and there. It's a perfect pick up / put down strategy rogue that's a little hard at first but once you get into the swing can be very rewarding. If they ever make a sequel the only thing I'd add is some sort of ship power level controls for a little extra control and strategy. Otherwise it's a great game that doesn't have any Pay To Win function at all. Top stuff devs, I'll be watching out for Harbingers 2!"", 'What I think, I have completely earned every ship and I start over so many times cause I love it! I really love that new weapons and ships are incorporated and would love to see what comes next Still loving the game! 2019', ""Moving ship around is broken. Confirmation after every move is quite annoying. Fix it please, and you'll get higher rating. Edit: It seems that game has some bugs. Some can be ignored, but others are irritating. As for the above, one has to restart the game at least once to mitigate the problem with moving. Other, noticeable issues are vanishing items once there is more than 4 in one sector, or frozen ui with missing hud once I try to do two way barter with ship having all four slots full. Other than that, the game can be quite enjoyable."", ""really like this game, but this is the 4th time@ least it crashed and wiped out my progress. infuriating! 1st time up to 93+ experience, now can't get past 30+ something before it crashes. Come on! Probably my device, look 4 games similar, still looking. 👍👍 from me. my type of game. TY 4 response! 😋 happens again, just start again! LOL"", 'I can say that this is the best game but it requires some more options like 1.we want gatling drones which are more in numbers but less in hull 2.we want to be able to have more secondry (auto) guns like pin missiles,power battery for more speed etc. 3.and PVP battles', ""I love this game. It's like a mini squad based tactical strategy game, with mini skirmishes over an expansive universe. Upgrading, repairing and selecting your ships is a key to long term survival, and it's a blast. I've spent countless hours working on and adapting my strategy, and then changing it again when unlocking new ships. More than worth the price tag."", 'This is a tough game but replays with the progressed equipment smooths the difficulty curve, well implemented. While I always felt outnumbered, tactics make the difference.', ""love the game but i still feel its lacking. a more intricate story line and perhaps a multiplayer? also, repairing around the battle station should be automatic for all ships. it takes time to press individually. 3 ships seems sad for me, can i have 5? i also love the part that the game is one time purchase and u can do everything in game w/o further cash. makes me remember the good ol'days"", 'Great game, love the graphics, the weapons and turret systems reminds me of Homeword/PC but top down. It can be frustratingly difficult and a bit if a grind, you can die by making a single bad decision but something keeps me coming back for more. Since unlocking more ships i am enjoying the game a lot more and the higher lvl ships are awesome.', 'You take a 3 ship squad and travel the map completing basic missions over either 4 levels or unlimited with the values on weapons scaling up for as long as you can last. Gameplay consists of tap to go controls, auto fire turrets and strike craft. Ships range from corvette to battleship and carriers. theres an emphasis on positioning when jumping from sector to sector for both you and the enemy and anomolies to look out for. Great game.', 'Love the game ever since it first released. i know its been awhile but is there any chance of a possible uodate? i was thinking for the ships the require parts to unlock, perhaps change the fighters appearance to match that ship, maybe add a new fighter (boarding ship that can capture enemy ships) maybe a new ship/environments. As a huge fan, i will still continue to support your team and its games. keep up the great work. Looking forward to seeing what you guys have next. And thanks again. :3', ""This is similar to a FunOrb Game; but, definitely not the same as that FunOrb Game. The Tutorials don't cover most of the GUI Features; and, don't describe the game as Turn-Based with each Jump = 1 Turn. Need to repeat the Tutorials until Level-2 is attained; maybe, until Level-3 is attained. Playing the Game while Online causes Lag Issues; and, other problematic issues. Start-Up Resources fluxuates between Game Re-Starts; and, and the Random Start-Up Resource Numbers doesn't make sense."", 'This is a great idea, and I think you could do a lot with a foundation like this in a sequal game. Also, you would get a ton of traction if you could pull of a star trek/halo version of this. Brilliant as is, but could be used as a phenominal foundation for a game with more options and complexity to it.', ""Please keep adding variety to this game it's just awesome it's literally my kind of game I love RTS Games and this one blew it out of the water please keep adding SHIPS AND WEAPONS AND LOTS OF THEM!! Y'all are doing an amazing job with these games and I loved every one of them they have not disappointed and those are facts. and the part is I can play this offline which makes it my main game, please keep your future games playable offline. Thanks for the game!"", ""You guys really need to pay attention to the horrid pictures of the alien characters. I mean those pics are really, really, really STUPID. I'm sure that between all your skills as a game developer one of you could try a little bit harder to stretch that imagination. Good luck!"", ""Game is a lot of fun. Don't have that much time in it yet, my only issue I've run into is the controls. I sent one of my ships in a different direction from the main ship and then couldn't get that ship to sync up again. Otherwise, fun times were had."", 'After playing it on the tablet....purchased it on steam. I enjoy this relaxing challenge.....nice graphics as well. ✌', ""It's better now with the improved blueprint drop rate but progression on getting new ships still feels a bit grindy and not that enticing. Partly because the ships you get are just slightly better so there's not much motivation. Unlocking a variety of things like weapons or races for example should be considered.""]"

Death Knight for the win!', 'Some maps have new paths for enemies to traverse which are created without warning late into your games. With an emphasis on upgrading towers, the first time this happens you\'re likely to lose, as you\'ll have resources tactically invested where the game has telegraphed enemies to travel.

I'd be happy to buy the game if they took away this mechanic.."", 'As everyone has mentioned the game is much more difficult than its predecessors.

The cute design and animation are easy on the eyes, the gameplay is fun and addictive. The ability and level system for heroes is a welcome improvement over the original; your hero does not level up and gain new abilities during the stage only be reset afterwards.

Tap on a bin to select that topping, then tap multiple times on the pizza to add items directly onto the pizza.  You don't need to drag individual toppings onto the pizza, so you can top faster than ever!  A quick swipe on the pizza will send it off the to the Bake Station.

BAKE STATION - Papa Louie's coal-fired oven gets an upgrade!  You can buy new Oven Alarms in the Shop to help you keep track of pizzas in the oven.  Simply drag an alarm onto one of the oven timers, and you'll hear an alert when that pizza is cooked just right.  Buy new Oven Boosters to cook your pizzas even faster than before!

CUTTING STATION - When it's time to cut pizzas, simply touch and drag a line across the pizza to decide where to cut.  If you want even more control to fine-tune your slices, you can also cut using multi-touch!  Use two fingers or thumbs to move each end of the line at the same time, and release to slice your pizza.  If you're having trouble cutting pizzas at the right angle, buy a variety of Cutting Guides in the Shop to cut that perfect slice!

NEW INGREDIENTS - We've added a ton of new ingredients which can't be found in the original Papa's Pizzeria.  As you play the game, you'll unlock 26 unique ingredients to serve your customers!

CUSTOMIZE YOUR LOBBY - You can spend your hard-earned tips in the Shop, where you can find a variety of posters, tables, decorations, and wallpaper styles for your lobby!  Use the brand-new Lobby tool to add items to your restaurant, and move and arrange them however you like!  Choose from over 140 customization items, and every item you add to the lobby will improve your Waiting Score for your customers!

UPDATED FEATURES - Serve picky closers at the end of the day, earn paychecks as you play the game, and try to please the finicky Food Critic to earn a Blue Ribbon!

Age of Civilizations,age.of.civilizations.jakowski,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=age.of.civilizations.jakowski&hl=en&gl=us,"Age of Civilizations is a turn-based strategy game in which your object is to dominate the world.

• Maps:
- Earth | [342 Provinces]
- Kepler-22b | [404 Provinces]

• Orders are submitted before each round. The number of orders you can submit during each round is limited by your Movement Points for that round.
• After orders are submitted, civilizations execute actions in turn order, which is randomized at the start of each round.

• Map
- The capital is the most important province in a civilization. If you lose your capital for 3 turns, your civilization will no longer exist. If you capture another civilization’s capital, you obtain all of its provinces. Capitals have a defensive bonus: +15% and an offensive bonus: +15%. Capitals have all buildings already constructed.
- Transparent provinces are neutral. Provinces with color belong to other civilizations.
- You can scale the map. To go back to the standard scale, double tap the map. If scale is other than standard on minimap you can see '!' in top right.
- Use the Economy and Population buttons to view each province’s Economy and Population values. Use the diplomacy button to view each province’s owner and engage in diplomacy (see Orders- Diplomacy View).

• Treasury
- Money is added to your treasury through income tax, which is based off your civilization’s total population and economy. Money is subracted from your treasury for military upkeep, which is based off your amount of military units (units at sea have a higher upkeep than units on land).

• Orders - Normal View
- Move: move units from one province to another. You can move between provinces you control or attack another civilization’s province.
- Recruit: recruit units from the selected province. This costs money and is limited by the population of the province. Recruiting from a province reduces its population.
- Build: construct a building in the selected province (see Building Types). This costs money.
- Disband: remove units from the selected province. This decreases military upkeep.
- Vassal: creates a vassal state with another civilization.
- Annex: brings a vassal state back under your full control.

• Orders - Diplomacy View
- War: declare war on a civilization.
- Peace: submit a peace offer to a civilization. If accepted, your civilizations will no longer be at war.
- Pact: submit a pact offer to a civilization. If accepted, the civilizations cannot attack each other for five rounds. This can be canceled through a War order one round in advance.
- Alliance: submit an alliance offer to a civilization. If accepted, that civilization will aid you in your military efforts. Use the War order to let allies know who your targets are.
- Kick: end an alliance with a civilization.
- Support: give money to a civilization.

• Building Types
- Fort: gives a province a defense bonus.
- Watch tower: allows you to see army numbers in neighboring provinces.
- Port: allows units to move into the sea. Units at sea can move back onto any land province, even if it doesn’t have a port.

Learning curve is a bit steap so would recommend starting on easy for the first few tries. After you get the knack it's pretty easy flowing even on hard. Some people have complained that progress isn't saved if you have to stop and come back. After quite a few games I can say the worst its been is one round of moves."", ""Great light TBS wargame. Has very light diplomacy options too. The AI doesn't send it's troops to sea that often, which could be a future improvement. Surgical incursions to take major ports and fortifications are satisfying - especially taking the capital. Thanks for this simple but engaging game."", 'Does not save game properly, very frustrating when you lose hours of progress with no fix. Its a shame as it is a good game, will be requesting for a refund.', 'Perfect time waster and a lot of fun, hope they release more maps', 'You game keeps deleting my data and when ever i zoom in it slows the game other then that i like please update this.', 'Love it, I can play this game for days and this is a mobile game', 'Its super laggy on my phone', ""Love the game, but I have a few problems. First, I wish I could upload a flag for when I create my civilization. I also think it would be cool if the Holy Roman Emperor could have the option of being able to add to the HRE, or if you could change a civilization's flag during a game. Finally, my biggest problem is that I can't delete scenarios or civilizations I created and I can't add new provinces because I have a Samsung Galaxy Tab A. Other than that, this game was well worth the wait. Thanks!"", ""So the game, even on easy, is much harder than it should be. I chose to start as Korea, and before I could even make a move I was wiped out. I was trying to forge an alliance, but China just stepped in and in 2 moves killed me. Didn't even get a chance to see what the game was like or anything. It is very unbalanced, and I'd much rather play one of the age games or civ compared to this garbage. It's not worth more than 1.99 that the game costs. In fact it's probably worth less."", 'I love this game, but I wish they had more options that automatically filled up the map, and I wish they had more maps, but overall a great game', ""I have played this game for two months now, l and I can tell you this is an excellent game. Indeed AoC does have a few bugs, though I do enjoy it very much. I absolutely love the game. And I can't wait to download AoC 2 (when I have compatible phone version)."", 'I get lag sometimes, it has some bugs. For example for no reason at all randomly my alliance will turn on me with no notice or notification. It says we are at war but they dont attack me. Its odd. However the game is great and I recommend it.', ""Is there a recent tutorial for this game? I have played it for a couple of days and still have no clue as to what I'm doing, lol. Please help!"", 'I really love this game, it\'s so fun strategizing how you were going to take down your enemy and how you are going to expand your Empire to be as large and Powerful as it can be, but there is one thing that is bothering me, it seems a little bit nitpicky but it\'s something that I would like to be added into a game in the future, I would like it if there was a way to create your own custom country or micro-nation of sorts with your own flag which you can import from your photo gallery and choose one area of the Map that your country will be placed, so in other words the ability to create your own custom country to play as, this is the only thing stopping me from saying ""this is the best game on the play store"" P.S if the developer sees this comment please take my idea into consideration, and don\'t take it too harshly I still love the game this is just an idea which I think would make it better then it is already', ""The game isn't optimized on newer versions of Android, it works fine if you don't zoom in/out of the map. The game lags horribly if you try to zoom in/out of the map. Otherwise fun game if it weren't so buggy."", 'OK, But This Game Is Still Laggy In My Device. Even I Set It To Lowest Setting (Graphics Settings). I Have 2GB Ram Devices With Octa Core Processor (8× ARM Cortex A53 @2.00GHz). GPU: PowerVr Rogue GE8320. Chipset: mt6765. Also My Storage Is Sufficient Enough. Why This Is Happen?? 😵', 'Love the game, bought it and been playing it for a couple years, i.also have the other AOC games, Asia, Africa, Europe, and America and they seem like they have more to them than the base game. Nothing against this game. What could be really awesome if the base AOC game had all the same little details that Asia, Africa, Europe, and America do and just mash all of that into one game instead of 4 different games. Like I said, nothing against the game or creator, just an idea i had on my head', ""Age of Civilizations is a decent strategy game that plays similarly to risk without those annoying micro transactions and pay to win features. It's worth all the money you purchase it for and definitely the most polished besides Age of Civilizations 2. The only thing I have a complain about is how stale it can get, I don't see myself playing this for more than an hour because it does get boring after you figure out the mechanics of the game."", ""I got the free version to try it out. Enjoyed it. Paid for full version. Even better. Unfortunately I had to uninstall as I didn't have the space. Not games fault. Old phone with small storage."", 'To the people who hate the game. get pc and buy aoc2 on steam! Its much better. Its so good I cant say the rigth words, and ots updated all of the time! One of the best games on steam!', ""Such a good game, was waiting for this for so long ever since i played the other games. Huge maps and no game is the same. Very enjoyable, way better than age of conquest and other games like this. It's like hoi4 and aoc4 combined into a game that's better than both of them. Actually the greatest strategy game on phone. (its also on steam if you wanna play the hugeee map)"", ""I hope the devs read this review, but they probably won't. I don't know what happened to this game. I bought it one year ago and had great fun. It was simple yet challenging and a few days ago I decided to reinstall it. And it cannot. Stop. Lagging. It freezes every 2 seconds. This isn't my devices fault, I can run tons of other more high spec games, and have 5gb left. It's a pity since I paid a few euro for this game."", 'Bottom line: I would get a refund for this game if I could. The strategy distills down to one objective: gain the most territory you can - every single turn. No amount of feinting, fortification, all-out capital assault, or anything else can overcome the overwhelming numbers the AI can throw at you once they gain a territorial advantage. Attacking is bugged (moving into the same new territory as another neutral nation will start a war rather than cancel the move), and pacts/alliances are random.', ""The game is good. But afteer zooming it's always lagging for some reason. And i believe it wasn't hardware issue since this is a fairly light game"", ""I like the game and it is fun, but only for a while. What would be fun is a multiplayer mode. I would also be cool to be able to create your own civilization with it's own territory and population, and when you vassal a country, you should get to decide the territory and how it interacts, and be able to create alliances with names and a funtion, and send or request military help from another country."", ""The gameplay is easy to learn, you expand your own territory by making war or creating alliances with other countries, yet some countries are just plain harder to win with than others. The two main maps are also well designed. This game could earn five stars if not for some optimization issues. However AOC is easily one of the best strategy series I've ever played on mobile."", 'Excellent strategy game. Easy to use but not over simplified, lots of territories so games last, different scenarios so you can vary the games definitely worth the install', ""I've play Age of Civilization (1&2 on both mobile and pc) for awhile. Have my doubt at first but this game is well made (even more impressed because of 1 man army thing). I love the game, so here's my constructive criticism about AoC 1 mobile: - It would be nice if there are option to make the text larger (mostly on text about army, diplomatic,etc.) - It is a litte bit lagging when i zoom in maximum on map. Overall it is a nice game and I would love to see more of your works.Thank you, developer"", ""Great game at a nice strategic / difficulty level. The game doesn't use up too much battery and is nice to be able to pause and come back to it as it is turn based. Very well constructed and would recommend to anyone who likes turn based games / strategy games"", 'It would be better if it had multiplayer, more sandbox customisation, more dynamics than just military, econohmy and territory. It would be cool if it included natural geographic barriers like mountains and various climates. It gets repetitive after a while', 'UI is terrible, controls are clunky, it feels like it should be free, not 2 dollars', 'Way under rated game, I cant believe a single developer made this. Very good stradegy game and gives a lot of diversity with different nations', ""I really like the game but when my tablet updated the game decided that every time I zoomed out or in it would cause serious lag and wouldn't ever stop I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the game but that didn't work so can you fix this. Apart from that really good game"", 'Suggestion: add a custom mode where you have full control over the game. For examply have the ability to place your and opposing capitals wherever you want or be able to control the economy of every nation and so on. As far as the game itself goes this is the best turn based strategy map domination game ive ever played.', ""Don't need to be online to play, therefore a battery saver. Great game, play at own pace, autosaves. No ads. longest game of mine took over 5 days and over 160 turns. Just saw AoC2, i hope it's as good as this"", ""I love civ games please work on it more. how can make more like original civ but on our phones bro. and add player 1v1 or 2v2 tournaments I don't I spent 8$ to thank you and keep going make it more. I ran into a very annoying problem. after conquering a province, they insist negotiating to be freed. it is very annoying to decline this offer every turn. specially I have to wait for my population to be above minority to assimilate."", 'Had this game in the past and it ran fine, zooming and panning around you get around barely 10 fps. Waste of 2 bucks tbh.', ""It's fun but only for awhile. What would make me play the game more is multiplayer. Like I would be stuck online for a long time if I am versing people. Or if that doesn't seem too much I would suggest adding co op or 2 player turn base"", 'Pretty well done. Just too simple with not many features and several bugs. The alliance system makes not much sense. I respect the work however and hope for a great PC game.', 'Love this game. Based on the old Risk board game. Strategic and tactical. The are a few bugs after latest update though.']"
Papa's Burgeria To Go!,air.com.flipline.papasburgeriatogo,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.com.flipline.papasburgeriatogo&hl=en&gl=us,"Papa's Burgeria is now available to play on the go, with gameplay and controls reimagined for Android phones.  Grill, stack, and serve burgers in a brand-new way!  

You're left in charge of Papa Louie's famous Burgeria, where you'll learn to take orders, grill patties, add toppings, and serve burgers to all of your crazy customers.  You need to multitask between each area of the restaurant, with new controls that feel just right in the palm of your hand: Head to the Order Station to keep an eye out for customers waiting in the lobby.  Switch to the Grill Station to drag patties onto the grill and flip burgers to cook them evenly.  Jump to the Build Station to carefully craft your sandwiches with toppings and sauces exactly how they ordered, and deliver the finished burger to earn points and tips!

Each Station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the burger-building process.  With full multi-touch support, the process is more fun than ever before!  Tap many burgers at once to flip them all on the grill, or keep one finger on the Build Station's bin slider for even better precision when building.

Keep your customers happy to earn more points and level up. As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings in the shop, and new customers will start visiting the Burgeria!  Papa's Burgeria To Go also features unlockable toppings that aren't available in previous versions!

**NEW FOR PAPA'S BURGERIA TO GO**

Papa's Burgeria To Go is redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens, so your fingers won’t get in the way of the action!

CONTROL WITH YOUR THUMBS - You'll switch stations using buttons in the corners of the screen, perfect for your thumbs.  Use buttons in the top corners to switch Order Tickets without having to drag them back and forth.  You can also view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading.

GRILL STATION - We've made keeping track of your burgers easier than ever, with Timers stuck in each burger patty that you can read at a glance, showing the cooking time and how each side is cooked.  You can also buy Alarms in the Shop to add onto each Timer, so you'll get an alert when it's time to flip or remove a burger.  With multi-touch support, you can quickly flip and remove burgers by using multiple fingers.  Try a triple-tap to flip three patties in a row!

BUILD STATION - With a traditional drag-and-drop system, your finger would block your view, so we've completely changed the Build Station to work on smaller screens.  You'll swipe a carousel of Topping Bins across the top of the screen, and slide it carefully to line up toppings with the burger below.  Simply tap on the bottom of the screen to drop a topping from the bin above!  You can also tap a button to swap your Topping Bins with Burger Bins, which hold all of the patties you've cooked on the grill.  And with full multi-touch support, you can keep one finger sliding the bins and another tapping on the bottom of the screen, so stacking burgers is a breeze!

I felt that the game will be similar to the one which is available at PC but it's too worst that I didn't want to even see this game again. I want my money back.

I have purchased all the things and there doesn't seem to be anything else to do. needs to be updated to include some features from the other games. at least something to buy. maybe transfer tips over to other games..."", ""Good concept, graphics couls be improved and i dont think this game is worth any money. It should be free because it is no where near as good as other games by the same company. You can't even decorate anything so this game is by far one of the worst from this company/developer"", ""I know its kinda weird to have this on a chromebook/laptop, but I do, because I love the Papa's franchise.

You are an astronaut awaking from cryonics not in the solar system, but... out there... in a far and unknown place of the galaxy. In Out There, you will have to survive, tinkering your ship with what you can gather drifting in the void, and spot garden planets to refill your oxygen supply. 

Space is an hostile place ; dangerous and mysterious adventures will mark each step of your travel. You will not only meet intelligent species that won’t care about you, but also deal with ancient powers linked to your destiny and the fate of mankind itself.

Survival and understanding of what is really at stake in the galaxy is the core of what Out There has to offer.

One may need a long string of good luck to get far... which may appeal to some, but also frustrate. Luck might extend into ways that might not seem ""realistic"", for example planets should often contain a much wider variety of available elements, so the involvement of luck often seems too punishing.', ""UPDATE 02/12/20 Game has been updated and it no longer crashes. Moreover, new features added. Big thanks to the devs for keeping such a great game running. PREVIOUS Sad to give this game a bad review. This is an excellent, challenging, creative game that will give players many hours of entertainment. Unfortunately it has not been updated in years and (as of this review on pixel 3 on Android 10) is no longer running. It's a real shame because is one of the best mobile games ever."", 'I love the new update. Also, bug reports: - Human icon shows an alien instead. - In a random event I got an Alien item. It had no protrait, and I could split it (0 alien, 1 alien). The names were also random elements like Tungsten. - I cannot move items to expanded item space after the Symbiotic Extension upgrade. The game acts like I\'m throwing things away. - When taking over ships I randomly can\'t interact with items. - Every once in a while I\'ll learn a word with no definition. ""ATLAS = ""', ""I really like this game for the story, graphics and atmosphere, but the inventory management required is such a massive detractor that i have to subtract 2 stars from this rating. It makes an otherwise fun experience painful. If constantly juggling far too few inventory slots is your kind of a challenge then this is the game for you. Also a bit buggy with the latest update. Sometimes i cannot interact with inventory when transferring cargo. Some slots will work, others won't."", 'The best space survival game I ve played so far. The intuitive and easy to learn game controls hides immersive gameplay coupled with an ethereal music score. The new Alliance addition has a tech update- cocoon, get this from rocky planets. With this in your ship, a cocoon ship emerges and gives you a second chance of survival wherever your character dies.', 'This is number 1 on my list of favorite mobile games of all time, my other two favorites being The Room and FTL. Excellent developers, extremely well created experience. I got this app before the release of Omega edition (the first major content update), and now I look forward to exploring even more through The Alliance update. Thank you, Mi-Clos Studio.', ""An exceptional game that left me in awe time and again, the latest update completely revitalised the game, it's like playing it for the first time. I wish there would be more games similarly thought through and carefully developed."", 'The gameplay is resource and technology management with limited inventory space. But the events and the different endings transform into an epic survival saga among the stars. Great update to the game by the way.', 'Been playing this since 2014. Still getting new content. Appreciate the work gone into this...... One of my fave games. 👍', ""Not working on Pixel 4 anymore. I guess I can trash the app now as there won't be any update soon :( Update : works again :)"", 'On of the best sci fi exploration games out there. A real gem.', 'OMG! Such an amazing adventure game! Congratulations for this incredible project! This game definitely deserve a lot of awards!', 'the game doesnt work on oneplus 7 pro which is a shame because it would look awesome.', 'This is nice and interesting game. I have spent a lot of hours playing this. Rendering me Space Rangers', 'Great game fun to play. The latest update is great', 'Game has a new update fixed my problem loving the new icon', 'Thank you so much for the update for newer devices!', 'Still amazing after all these years! Always something new when I come back. Thx guys! Great work!', 'Super fun and the update looks great!', 'As many other reviews have stated, this game is outdated on the mobile version. It no longer posts or records achievements. If you do not care about the achievements but love this type of game, you can still play it offline as a time-killer. I bought this app a long time so I do not regret purchasing it although I do miss getting the achievements.', ""This game is completely pot luck. The only skill in the game is trying to rearrange the materials you need but only when it gives it to you. Just when you think you are managing, bam! It hits you with something that ends the game. Nearly £4 for a game that involves going to a star system collecting minerals and most importantly fuel (which can be a right joke) and trying to get back to earth. Don't waste your money unless the price goes down to £1"", 'Boring and repetitive. Nothing extraordinary about this game.', 'It used to be a great game, I played it a year ago, but now there is a lot of bugs, especially when using the ship with 8 sphere in a square, and the switching of ships is also buggy, some equipment cannot be selected and dismantled', 'Great game. Challenging and lots of content. Even on easy its very difficult. This is because your winning the game is based solely on luck. Loot from drills and probes is very inconsistent, certain materials are needed to progress and if you dont get them by the second solar system the third will be your last. The main problem is space for carrying items. There just isnt enough at the start. I love this game but i fear i will never know what happens at the end.', ""Insanely addictive, deceptively complex and unexpectedly challenging! If you like rogue like, upgrades and a genuine strategy with some really challenging gameplay this is probably for you. I spent ages toying with the idea of paying for a game like this, I'm glad I did! It's rare you find a game these days without micro transactions even at a premium price. The worldbuilding is excellent and the story is intriguing, I can genuinely see myself coming back to this time and time again."", ""*edit* works again on on ui 2 Great game. On a note10plus now it freezes at game start. Have to reboot phone uninstall reinstall. It's getting annoying. *edit* another week unplayable moving to uninstall soon."", 'I love the game, when I can play it . The screen wants to freeze when I load it. Using a note 10+ this this game locks up. Touch screen and no response . Trying to continue leads to black screen and once again no response. I feel like I wasted my money.', ""A well written and interesting game that constantly kills you and forces you to restart. Extremely frequent no-win scenarios. During a recent playthrough, I died from lack of oxygen because I never encountered a planet that had oxygen. Basically it's super random and you have to get super lucky to win. Annoying."", 'Excellent resource gathering game with great graphics and captivating story. I feel however that the RNG is much more unforgiving than it needs to be.', 'I haven\'t made it all that far yet, but I want to say that thought the graphics are ""cartoonish"" they are REALLY well done, the art is FANTASTIC, really. the game isn\'t that hard to pick up and  figure out, it DOESN\'T require a instruction manual, a feature that cripples many games today (over complexity). This is a perfect middle ground for complexity really, a 12 year old should be able to understand this easily. I really like this game actually, I for my part have my derelicts enabled in settings, haven\'t found any yet but surely in the future i will find one, am interested to see what it says about it when it happens.  for some reason fuel seems to be on the inner planets closer to the supernovas (sun) and metals further away when in truth the heat of the supernova would burn the gases off, but it is a video game.. as far as a story and all I have to admit I have enjoyed the bit of this I have played. I have been looking at this title for a longtime and been unsure about it for a longtime, I am glad I finally picked it up, now if google would stop removing stuff from our accounts after we pay for them it will be all good, but you know how it is, Esau is ALWAYS busy.', ""It's a good fun game but it has issues. Hasn't been updated or changed in anyway in years. Everything is random so you can't plan ahead meaning you can easily lose a run through no fault of your own and have to start all over again. The nature of RNG. In all the years I've owned this game and played on Normal, I have never been able to complete a run because of the RNG. Thats what makes this game frustrating. If you don't care about that then you may still have a good time."", 'This is a beautiful game that is very challenging. It is hard to win. You need to be careful, plan thoughtfully, and yes get lucky. If you cant tolerate needing some luck to win a difficult game I wouldnt recommend. But, the gameplay is intuitive, the design and feel is beautiful, and if you like survival/resource management games the replayability is fantastic. Every play through is different. Worth the buy.', 'As many other reviews have stated, this game has not been updated in years and crashes on newer hardware. Samsung galaxy s10 +, game freezes immediately on title screen, music continues to play but screen is completely frozen and unresponsive.', 'Bravo to the developers, this is a truly wonderful game that has very clearly been designed for touchscreens. No stupid action sequences, no finicky controls, just you and a deep system of mechanics to explore. I would love to see the starter ship be randomized, and I wish I could destroy a piece of tech to learn its blueprint, and make no mistake, this game is just unfair, giving you new ships that, if you take them, make progress impossible being my personally most hated trick.', 'Choose your own adventure across unforgiving and semi-random space. Enjoy the atmosphere. Embrace the challenge. Die alone. Learn from your mistakes. Repeat. Decent port of a cool little game, but achievements seem to be broken. No big deal--just an observation. See you Out There.', ""Don't get me wrong, I love this game. I am just so upset that the ACHIEVEMENTS DON'T WORK, especially after finishing the most difficult ending and realizing that fact. Once that small issue is addressed, then this will be a 5 star review instead. The music is great, the story is interesting and enigmatic. I would still suggest buying this game, for sure."", ""I don't usually go for mobile games, but this one is really enjoyable. It has a loosely told story, though the real seller is the survival. It can be frustrating to see about 2 hours, and 60 star systems worth of progress end because of chance, but that's part of the game, though It is still doable. The music and art style is really well done, and sets a haunting tone for the game. It's not action based, but if you don't mind a slow burn and a challenge, you'll enjoy it."", 'Really fun Sci Fi survival game. It actually feels like a light weight FTL, in the sense that you jump from star to star accumulating resources to reach the end game. You find things like technology, discover the language of the gods, and find derelict ships you can take over (including all your own lost ships). It is fun, but can sometimes feel like a pure game of chance.', 'In short this is a dark, story driven adventure game with a heavy emphasis on resource management. Of the few dozen games Ive played on Mobile, this is my favorite. Its not a free game but it is worth the money. No microtransactions or ""pay to win"" type gameplay. Its a complete game with several endings depending on the path you choose. The galaxy is randomly generated each time, which makes some sessions harder than others depending on the hand you get dealt.', 'Loved Out There for its great story, beautiful visuals, and peak roguelike mechanics. Got a new phone (Samsung Galaxy S10+) and now it freezes on the homescreen. Unfortunate for how much I want to keep playing this.']"

Been on and off playing for a few years the community has gotten tighter over the years and its harder for newer players to start or to come back and start all over again.

Should implement a battle system were you can only attack people within a certain range of your xp.', ""Easy to get the hang of. Simple game you can't really leave behind, I've left and returned 4-5 times in my years of playing. You can argue that new players are left in the dust, but if you make 9 of every ship n send them to lvl 1 swarm, you can shield and grow easy. I hope this comment is seen by many, because this would really get new players to like the game so much more. Can't be attacked if you got a shield!!!!

Awesome game!"", 'Been playing for 2000+ days. every time I leave, I end up coming back. chat is excellent, but makes you a target. Newer players advised to join alliances, especially if they are going to be active in chat. While not a fast paced game, patience and longer term tactics will give a definite payout, and watching your fleet grow and your resource hauls increase is an incredibly satisfying experience.', 'Having played two years ago, I tried to give the game a chance once again, to little avail. The capability of players in the top echelons of the game to attack players just starting out leaves little opportunity for growth, nor fun. You could spend months rebuilding only to lose it all to a single player three leagues above you who pinged you from four seperate alts over the course of days waiting for your shields to go down, ready to wipe you the moment they do.', 'so far i think the game is pretty nice but the box that pops up that asks you a question is really annoying and it gets frustrating at times cuase if you answer wrong it signs you out for a certain amount of time and nobody is perfect so ever once in awhile i will click the wrong button and get signed out, worst of all the amount you can get signed out for is unreal. and if a developer some how stumbles upon my comment i ask, can you please remove the pop up questions?', 'I love this game. The limitless power you can get feels awesome, but it gets boring after a couple months.', ""I've raged quit this game a couple times and restarted, but I always come back to this game because of the amazing mechanics and how I've always been amazed by the ability in this game to go further, and the longer you remain silent in this game the stronger you can get, or if you make a guild you can create a name for yourself to get stronger that way. Over all a great and amazing game to play by yourself or with friends!"", ""frustrating. I've been playing this game for about a week now. still under beginner protection. spent hours building fleets. I say fleets because I've been ambushed so many times I've lost count. Even though they give you material to rebuild, that doesn't account for the time invested. they want people to interact. they want people to spend real money. but they still wipe you out at random. for that reason I give only 2 stars. without the ambushes I'd give at least 4 stars."", 'Been playing since way before outposts, 2016 to be exact.

The graphics are made in a cartoony like style and that fits well for me. 10/10 one of the best purchases I made.', 'Fantastic. If youre a fan of the other Kingdom rush games. This is for you. My only gripe about the games is the hand holding in the early stages. I wish we were able to level up the towers earlier in the game. Instead of waiting four stages in. But this game is phenomenal with the addition of your chosen hero having a unique ability you can use at your leisure which is a nice to use in a tight spot. Overall, you should buy it if you liked the other ones', 'I started following Kingdom Rush (2011) on chrome webstore and since then I have been a huge fan of Ironhide studio games. I have purchased all their games and have been playing them constantly whenever I need a good adrenaline rush. This game is amazing in terms of strategy, your hand eye coordination, instant decision making under pressure. There is no comparison in terms of difficulty among all the KR Saga since all of them are equally challenging and test you to the limits.', 'This game, in my opinion is the worst of the series. But even being the worst, it is still better than almost any other tower defence game out there. So many little easter eggs and references to movies and other games...such a great game would recommend buying but only if you have bought the other games first, Kingdom rush, Kindom rush Frontiers, and Kingdom rush Vengeance', 'I really like these games but the reason for 4 stars is it is really similar to the last one. I was hoping for something different but keep the same type of concept. Maybe add more components to the game or something.', 'This is a big upgrade from the first two kingdom rush games and feels much more refined and fun than the previous ones.The difficulty and strategic gameplay is still maintained very well and the heroes feel more like heroes and less like lieutenant troops from an army with the hero upgrade tweaks.Overall,a must try for strategy game lovers!', ""The most enjoyable strategy tower defense game experience I've ever had.

This one is not only a great addition it is also much more difficult but the difficulty increases gradually instead of exponentially like the original frontiers.', ""In my last review I stated there were no microtransactions, that was an error because there are microtransactions. They are not needed and the game is still fun.

I played the first many times, got the 2nd a couple months ago and now this and I don't regret a thing. Keep the series going!!"", ""I like the game just as much as normal kingdom rush.

Not my favorite game of the series but still very good.

(I recommend not investing any money in this game so you don't regret it in the long run) I finished the game and it didn't save my data. Other people are complaining about pricey Heros and gems which are true. The most you can spend on the Heros was something around $6.99 which is outrageous. Please don't buy anything extra! I buy Prince Denas and realized that I don't want him and pass the policy for 10 day refund. (I didn't know at all)"", 'Feels like guessing which tower types will work this time instead of strategizing. Especially when starting a new level.

The pinnacle series for defense games. This fits the mold.', ""The Kingdom Rush games are some of my favorite tower defense games because of their artwork and the way that the games progress as you play through them. I also like the challenge that they start to add once you get the hang of the towers and how best to try to use them. As for the in app purchases in the game they are not needed to win and I am not sure why so many people say that they are. So all in all if your into strategy games I'd say to give this one a try."", 'I bought the 5.99 kingdom rush game and it really seemed like pay to win. Ive rebeat this game a few times and its always enjoyable.. fair yet challanging, fun, and no NEED to spend money. Id rather pay 20 bucks for a game upfront then be tricked into needing to pay to win. Please go back to making games like this one and frontiers... pretty please', 'Great game played it through multyple times and it is as fun everytime.The heroes also are rearly fun and make the game just a bit easier if you are finding the game too difficult.', 'Love all the Kingdom Rush games.

I like the new spell and hero spells. The new designs for towers look better to."", 'I enjoyied all 3 kingdom rush games and im just now learning that there is another one so that makes 4 KR games and im excited to play it, but it KR Vengenge costs money so i have to get a job so i can pay for it.', 'A high fantasy skin for kingdom rush with new voice lines for the towers, still sticks to the same 4 tower functions, if you like the kingdom rush series this is more of the same.']"

I have reported some bugs through the Mod section and all they do is keep asking new questions and never resolve. And why the whole censure thing? People keep complaining but developers just don\'t care about English speaking people. Words like ""game"" and ""is"" are forbidden while the Chinese can say all they want. The response right now from the developers is again not helpful', ""It's an entertaining game and if you have a year and £1000 spare you can almost contend with others! I have spend over five years on clash but in the last year have hardly played it. Development have censored basic words making it very hard to hold a conversation.

Yes it starts out as a free game but you will NOT I repeat you will NOT be competitive if you don't spend at least $200 per month on this game. You will be zeroed by 2 hits from another player and all your hard work and long hours are worth nothing. Also, the game is pretty boring.

Then when you reach the Challenger arenas, players that are 3 levels higher then you start matching with you. It's ridiculously annoying when your just trying to play and you go up against higher level opponents. It's literally impossible to beat them. The game is literally pay to win. I've given this game many chances but the matchmaking always ruins it."", 'So while I love this game and the game mechanics behind it, it is the most out of balance game. Not in the units, but in the matchmaking. The game pairs you up with people of similar trophies, but will decide when you win and when you lose. If you are too high of trophies for your level, it will pair you against decks that are meant to counter you. If you lose too many times, it will pair you against decks that you counter. There is no strategy in the end, just divine intervention from the devs.', ""I think it benefits players who spend a lot of money on the game to much. For the people that are free to play it's not so great. I heard it's supposed to be random battles, but when you start to win several you start getting matches against hard counters. Usually several in a row. And people with better cards. So it looks like there just trying to get you to spend money for upgrades. About to delete the game."", ""I don't understand who did the match making system but I don't think they understand the concept of balance. When you go into a match and your cards are out leveled by over 3 levels and your tower is under it makes it nearly impossible to even come close to winning. They tend to also favor putting you in those kinds of matchups after you win one or two games."", ""I mean I think the battle pass is a load of rubbish but apart from that it's still an amazing game and I enjoy it. I think it has gotten a bit too easy now though because it is really easy to get to the legendary arena and higher, back then it was nearly impossible to get to hog mountain or the other arenas that used to be the best. Oh and legendaries are really easy to get too. Apart from that, it's a good game."", ""WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!!!This game use to be fun until supercell got greedy. There's no strategy anymore... the game will be over before it starts based on your card selection and you can't see your opponants. It's just 3 minute intermus of getting your face beat in because you don't have cards to counter I suggest anyone thinking of downloading to look at all the recent low ratings!!!!!!"", ""The game is a fun and enjoyable game and although it seems easy to play you require a lot of skills. However it is hard to level up in this game which makes it frustrating when you face people of high levels. Supercell doesn't fix the level issue because this doesn't apply to the pros who are all already level 13. I HOPE Supercell can make it easier to level up to make this a game more fun and enjoyable and not just cashing on gems and stuff to try to level up."", ""I really wanted to like this game. I love the concept of it. But the matchmaking is horrible. I play against level 12 when I'm level 6... How does that even make sense? Also, the way this game is designed I'd that if you win 2 games in a row, then you lose 2 games in a row. It takes SOO long to rank up, this is more of a grind game. It's also a pay to win game, you can win just by paying. It's so stupid and the game is SO bad. Like, hackers in this game is too intense. Every 10th game is hacker."", ""App is great but ever since last night, it won't open. I tried getting help through sending feedback but haven't heard anything and got an automated response through email telling me to go into the game & ask for help from there but I can't do that since I can't even get in 😩 hopefully I get some help because I'm scared I'll lose all progress if I uninstall & reinstall"", 'Base game is entertaining. The better you get at the game though the more you realize the faults of it. Forced slow down with chest openings creates a need to purchase ways to open chests. Purchase prices are incredibly difficult to stomach. There is no player report button so the higher level players will cheat approximately 60% of the time. Clearly a lack of concern from the developers', ""I have played this game for 3 years (which they have failed to recognize) and I hate it. The only reason I still play is my friends. The pairing system is aweful. Cheats are also allowed. It's a pay to win game. I'd you pay for gems, you'll be better. No matter what. I'm a strategist, and I won most battles. But when I come up against a level 10 king level that has star level cards that game kill any of my troops with 3 shots, there's nothing to do. Please fix it. I know you won't see it."", 'The game as a whole is ok, but am now NOT impressed with their service. I tried to purchase a 19.99 deal they were offering, never recieved. I was told to wait and check back if it doesnt appear. I did exactly that, and was told they can do nothing for me. I have the screen shots as proof and would post them but google play doesnt seem to allow that.', ""It is a good strategy game but it has some flaws. Good part is that it has awesome graphics and easy to use. Bad part is that at some point, you get to battle against players who use money to get cards especially legendary ones ... and it really annoys me. It isn't fair. If you use real money to buy cards or chests then you should only get to battle those who have done the same. Seriously .....I get really annoyed. The matchmaking is really really bad. I would give a 2 star off 5 for it."", ""It's a good game for strategic players. But I it should also have a report option for the players who leave the 2v2 battles in between the match or even after starting a match. I really hate when such players enter as my partner in random options. So the developers should think about it and come to a decision for this problem. The worst thing about the game is the tie breaker. I don't like that."", ""It's a nice game if you like live action strategy. Stack your deck and use it wisely. You get a lot of noobs when you first start playing but as you level up and collect trophies things get more interesting as you run into more evenly matched players. The only drawback is the wait time to open chests is a little long. Quick, fun, and great for playing on those short breaks at work or at home."", ""This is a great game with an easy concept. That only problem with it is the same problem they have with every other supercell game. The matchmaking. They love to put you up against people that are so high level that anything you use can and will get one tapped. Other than that not too bad. Some op cards like the Pekka and mega night will never be fixed. I've come to terms with that😥"", ""from a player who played for 3 years 1. the inevitable problem with the so called free to play games like this one is that sooner or later you find yourself playing against either suckers that are several levels higher than you ( because they paid more) or noobs that you crush easily. there's rarely a good game win or lose. there's no satisfaction. 2. matching mechanism is especially bad for this one. 3. balance changes are a joke. one only needs to check their twitter account for history."", ""It's great that this game listens to the players at the highest level and makes balance changes based on that, but the normal players just trying to get to arena 13 or whatever are completely ignored. Players have been asking for nerfs to cards like wizard and mega knight for a while but they just get ignored and end up playing against them almost every game. While they aren't good at e sport level, the majority of the playerbase isn't e sport level and they suck to play against constantly."", ""It's a great game that just keeps on giving. I've been playing for over 4 years and it's still one of the only games I haven't deleted. Not only are you able to talk, play, and share with friends but you always having something new coming out like a new character card, new challenges, new bounces, and even more like the new pass royal that let's the hard core players get more for only $5!!"", ""Absolutely horrendous. Pay to win trash. What a giant turd this game has become. So much non sense going on. I need to spend 20 minutes just opening chests and watching slow animations while they try to sell me a fake with fake cards for $99. Are you kidding me?! I wouldn't pay a dime towards this awful game and you shouldn't either. Pay to win. Pay to win. Supercell has ruined games with a hard push to force kids to spend big money just to compete. Shame shame."", ""Note to retard developers: Although you may THINK you are punishing players for losing their connection while in a battle by not allowing them to team up for a time without letting them know that anymore because you know as well as we do that it isn't fair.... But it won't stop players (wink wink) that KNOW (statistically) when they are going to lose to just stop playing. How dumb can you guys get?"", ""Full of pay-to-win people, not fun at all. You don't need much skill to play this game, just pay them money. They don't support free-to-play people and their 2v2 algorithm is off balance. I had to fight a level 11 at level 6 multiple times. I don't recommend this unless you want to waste time. Disclaimer: This game will make you mad. I would rate 0 stars if I could"", ""To the Developers: my cards are at max level and now use stars. But i only get half the stars awarded to me. Example: When I open a chest it tells me I have a number of stars 155 and when it goes to tally up the Stars after getting out of the chest screen it's always Tally's up as much less 61. What gives? I'd like the rest of my stars so that I can give you the rest of your stars. I keep getting short changed on stars. I'm still wait for developers to respond! *****"", 'If you enjoy constantly being mismatched against opponents who have higher level cards and towers than yourself then this is the game for you. Supercell keeps doing ""balance changes"" (read random card changes) but don\'t address the horrible matchmaking algorithm, the entire way that they match you against opponents is based solely on your trophy count so you get punished quickly for having success and if you want to play for free forget about it unless you have years to dedicate to a mobile game', ""The game is absolute garbage. Based entirely on money spent and luck of the draw for your deck. The matchmaking is incredibly flawed. You'll be absolutely screwed of your WiFi is bad. The deploy time for the card can increase fivefold if your game loads slowly. The game clearly registers the play, but it won't implement it, meanwhile, your opponent gets a free run at your towers."", ""Gameplay is fun and requires having a good strategy. That is all that is good with it. The matchmaking is trash, does not matter how good your strategy is if you get paired with opponents who are at least 2 levels higher than you in both long tower level and card level. It's getting ridiculous what's it is next to impossible to advance in trophies. I get the pass but this matchmaking I think it's just the game developers trying to get you to spend tons on money on gems so you can buy upgrades."", ""Could be a great game if it weren't for the serious Pay to win issues and fundamentally flawed matchmaking. I am routinely matched up against max level players (I'm level 11) with mostly or entirely maxed out units. Essentially, at least one of three things is true: 1) Matchmaking is rigged to discourage consecutive games 2) I'm so unbelievably good at the game it's only fair to match me up against impossible opponents 3) If they don't take card & player lvl into account, its simply bad design"", ""Addictive game, but aparent speed hacks. If you don't have the speed hacks don't waste your money trying to level your heros the speed hacks are faster and more powerful. How the people that made this game don't know about it is silly but it's what it is. Great game though even better if everyone was on the same playing field. Thumbs up"", ""I've played this game since launch day and it is still a very unique and fun game. I only have one major problem and that's the Mega Knight. The pay-to-win players use this card nonstop and it completely destroys everything and honestly is ruining matches that could be competitive. I'd say fix Ram Rider as well, but atleast you can get away without it completely destroying your towers. Simple balances would make this game as close to perfect as it could be."", ""This game has become quite unfun. Almost 80% of the games I play, I get matched up with players with higher levels. And I'm constantly going against the same overpowered cards. Example: I always get matched up with players who use Mega Knight and Magic Archers. Both of these cards are super OP and definitely need a nerf. It's really frustrating to play a game that's being structured to aid those who pay. Overall an unbalanced pay-to-win game that I would NOT recommend new players to download."", ""This is a amazing game. The patience you need in the game is amazing. The only reason I don't give it a 5 star is because you need pass royal to do alot of nice things. I get to get the best treatment you need money thing but some people don't really have money to pay for it. I just wish they gave commoners a better game experience. Also trading is annoying because you always need to have a trading token to trade and it's hard to get those. But over all an amazing game and highly recommend it."", ""Don't bother paying or playing. Played for 4+ years and can't take how rigged the game is. Nobody will admit, but when they want you to lose a game, you'll face some impossible to beat combination and they'll never make a mistake. Basically playing vs an AI opponent. They do this so they can limit the free rewards you earn by winning, and therefore require you to pay for cash rewards to progress your account."", ""I actually stopped playing for a while and I've just returned, just to discover that it has become way, way worse. Every single card that they have added is worse than the other, I get put against players who are times two from my skill level, and this is just the most sad thing I have ever seen. From the best mobile game this app has turned into a pile of trash, and I'm really sad to see this happen. I hope they can fix this, but in order for that to happen they need to remove every new update"", 'Good app but not for free to play gamers like myself. It\'s been over 2 years since I\'ve started playing this game but gems and coins are a major limiting factor to my progress. *Edit* Over the past few years I\'ve seen great improvements in terms of how f2p players are treated and I greatly appreciate it. As for the gameplay, however, realistically there hasn\'t been much added that screams ""what a huge overhaul"" Improving my rating from 3 to 4 I love this game and am looking forward for newstuf', 'I have been playing this game for a long time, and I just have to say that it doesnt get boring. Well done Supercell for managing to create such an amazing game! Personally, you guys should include some sort of water character. There is just no water in it. Overall, though it is really fun. Great work.', 'Not paying for another month of premium till you start changing things for the better. No innovation in game modes, same old ""this spawns on either side"". Most challenges are either a roll of the dice or to easy. No new ideas. More chest slots? Where is a 2v2 ladder? How about a pve mode versus waves of enemies? How about a spell card that shields an area from spell damage for a time, so there is an actual counter to spells?', ""The tiebreaker feature sucks, forcibly moving the towers' health in order to create an outcome isn't the way to create fair game play. The matchmaking for 1v1 is trash. I have won a fair bit of level 12's when I was level 9, but I'm seeing people who pay to play and max out their cards at level 13 and absolutely destroy other players. It's not fun to play. This game is becoming a pay to play ghst forces you to stay at the same level and pay $5 a month to play. Not worth it. May uninstall."", ""It's not Clash of Clans, that's for sure. It was fun, but a little too easy. Plus, if I'm paying for the Gold Pass in one game I don't want to pay for it in another. Without the Gold Pass, it gets boring. 3 out of 5 stars because it's a good game, just seems like a simplified version of CoC."", ""The gameplay is good, however the matchmaking is so shameless. Playing vs players at the higher ranks is always against people with higher level cards than you. It doesn't feel good when the you're not on an even playing field and your opponent is only beating you because they've spent more money than you it feels horrible as there is nothing you can really do win. The core gameplay is fun, but this game is pay to win."", ""Pretty P2W in the higher trophy range. Though trade tokens can really help F2P players, they still have to be willing to spend a lot of time on the game (I literally mean 5+ MONTHS) to acquire max level cards (let alone A FULL DECK). Other than that, it's a really fun app. New Edit 2020: App is frozen and will not load. It keeps loading up to 50% then saying its updating on repeat. Fix it and I'll change my rating...""]"
