How to play

-check your knowledge: answer questions, read descriptions for correct answers and compete with other players.
-to complete a level, you have to find the exit in a trivia maze. 
-you get points for each question answered correctly. If you give a wrong answer, no points are added to your account. Moreover, each wrong answer takes one of your lives. Your lives are displayed in the top left corner of the screen.
-if you continue playing after finding the exit, you will get more points for each question answered correctly. 

Questions:

-all questions are filtered by difficulty. The more questions you answer, the more difficult questions you get. The difficulty of a question is indicated by white scales under each question. 
-you get more points for difficult questions.

Coins and lives:

Coins are the in-game currency used in QuizzLand. Use coins to buy lives, hints and other useful options.
-if you want a larger amount of coins, you can make such a purchase in QuizzLand Store. To open the Store, tap on the cart icon in the top right corner of the screen.
-earn coins without buying them: collect you daily coin bonus, watch suggested videos or get coins by playing mini-games inside the maze. 
-you also get coins once the level is completed. In this case, the number of coins depends on how many questions you answered correctly.
-your lives refill in a few minutes but you can also get them faster for coins. You can also get lives if you watch a suggested video.

Question hints:

‚ÄúDouble Chance‚Äù - activate the hint, then choose the answer. If it is incorrect, then you'll be able to try to answer again.
‚ÄúFifty Fifty‚Äù -  eliminate two incorrect answers in a question.
‚ÄúMajority Vote‚Äù - see what answer option the majority of players have chosen.
‚ÄúSkip Question‚Äù - activate the hint to skip a question and answer another instead.

- UI improvements","[""Great game! It's a good mix of easy and hard questions, the mini games break things up well. The game makes me want to keep playing. It looks good and has simple graphics. I like the information it gives after you answer, so you can learn more. There's not too many ads -- you get one for wrong answers and you can watch one for more in-game coins."", ""Awesome game... I love that they explain the question and the answers after each one, no matter if your correct or wrong... even on the questions that you answer correctly they will still explain it and I'm always enhancing my knowledge on things that I already knew about... And the questions that I was incorrect about, I get to learn about right then and right there... I'm always learning something new when playing this game..... Impressed!!!!!"", ""I have been playing quizzland for about a year now and love it. However, recently, you've made changes to the graphics in the game that are so off-putting that I find them most annoying! Why fix something that's not broken! It was all wonderful before! Now, it's horrendous to look at! Please, please change the graphics back to how they were."", ""As a game its great, I'm pass 100 levels now, but I enjoyed it back then because I could see everything clearly, the contrast of the tile icons was much better. It wasn't broke so why try to follow the sheep in fixing it. I've read other posts who don't like the new white tile look, I'm glad I'm not alone, maybe given enough complaints you'll revert back to the old design prior to the UI update. Also, why are we now automatically charged coins when we don't have enough chances, ask first please."", 'Repeatedly says that I\'ve had perfect games even though I clearly have made mistakes. Apart from grammatical challenges, fair number of questions are repeated. The minigame requiring you to remember the snowflake cards flashed doesn\'t work. Finally, under Account Settings, the ""preparing user data"" doesn\'t\'t seem to do anything.', ""Absolutely the best trivia game ever üëå. Not only do you get the questions, but some really cool info along with it. And other player's comments are a bonus... they'll either make you laugh, or sometimes angry, but they're always entertaining. The whole game is super duper üëç.üòÉ"", ""I love how you learn while playing this game. It's fun answering the questions and choosing which categories. I also love the hints are given quite frequently so that you dont have to spend coins on them frequently."", 'Super fun! I like how they only put in ads if you fail a level. It would be nice if in the profile pictures you could see all of them in row and column format though...\U0001f9f1 Other then that, great game!', ""The questions are better. However, I had problems technically and it appears I'm no longer @ the 2 üåü üåü level: stars dropped to 1.

I got the the 160's. Help!!"", 'For a trivia game, it is both informative and entertaining....the seasonal version was great! This is by far the best trivia app I have ever used!! The update turned out to be a pleasant surprise. Game is still fun and informational', 'I love this game. I would have rated it 5 stars except that the graphics have changed recently. The have become very simplistic. This really takes away from the fun of the game.', 'Great game! The only time you see ads is when you get an answer wrong or by your choice! Mini games are fun and challenging too! Keep it up!', 'Excellent trivia game! I really like that they tell you more about the subject whether you get the question wrong or right. I am very glad I found this game. I highly recommend it.', ""It was amazing especially that it gives background about the topic. Well done! It serves as a guide for students and keep up the good work. It's a game everyone must have."", ""I've had this game awhile and I loved it until you changed the graphics on 2/18/20. Now they are ridiculous. Simplistic and stupid. I'm considering uninstalling the app. No longer a pleasure to play."", ""Back to one star again!! Why on earth do you try to keep forcing the hideous unusable interface on us? The previous graphics were perfect and east to use and understand.If it ain't broken it doesn't need fixing! I personally shall stop using the game until the player friendly interface is reintroduced AGAIN!!!"", 'Among so many quiz games and puzzle games this is one of the best so far I have ever played.. awesome facts and rich in informations..... Awesome game... Nice to play in free time, which is quiet useful to know about things..', 'A great little app which you can return to at leisure. Loads of choices for how you progress. Only criticism is the awful pastel colours after an update. Please put it back how it was.', 'Love this game. Excellent for developing thinking skills and general knowledge. Too many ads though.', 'The latest update of the game has changed all of the screens and icons to a faded pastel. The screens are harder to read.', 'Yesterday I would have rated this game a 5,I loved it and played all the time. Today they changed the graphics and I can barely look at it. It hurts my eyes,and the look is very childlike. Very upset!', 'This game is astonishing. It gives u a good sense of humor. It tells us somethings that we dont even know happened.', ""So simple, fun and informative! This app is getting addictive, takes a while to get into but now I've learnt so much from it. Honestly for me it's a life saver. Circumstances at home meant I missed a lot of school laterly, and I have severe social anxiety. This app has changed my mindset somehow and instead of me being a terrified, dumb, speechless kid I can now relate to so many more topics, open so many more conversations, and actually have the confidence to speak to others now. Thank you!"", ""I love this game. The answer explanations are fantastic. I also love the changes you made - the daily rewards are now fantastic. Your coin rewards have always been and, even more so now, incredibly generous. The questions are challenging and I've learned a lot while enjoying the experience. Thank you very much! I still don't know what to do with the show exit hints. . Still a great game. Best trivia game out there. Thank you."", ""Very fun, simple and actually free unlike a number of other games. You earn enough coins that you don't have to buy any in game with real money."", 'Fun game if you are good at trivia. Too many ads if you are not.', ""I actually Like the game itself alot. But there are way to many ads. It seems everytime an answer is wrong, you have to watch an ad. It's fine to tolerate for awhile but then I just got tired of seeing ad after ad. I also cannot seem to find anything that tells you how the game really works...example: you cant find the exit and just move to the next level. You still have to open all the boxes first. It gives you a FIND EXIT bonus reward to use but I dont understand why that is."", ""Love this game! I like to play never using the hints or helps. More fun and honest for me that way. The ability to look at the day's history, and study the questions that I answered incorrectly is awesome! Because, it is just as much a learning experience, as it is a game. Especially after so many years post-school. Learn new things every day. Love it!"", 'An interesting presentation of a trivial pursuit type game. Nicely paced, with well presented questions and an attractive interface. The format encourages participation, maintaining interest with pseudo prizes and a variety of activities. Overall I am impressed by the quality of the program, though I would like to see some method of turning off the mini-games as I find them distracting to the general flow of the game as a whole.', 'Trivia questions are fun. The big problem is how the level system works. If I\'m here for the trivia, I\'m going to do all the questions, so why would i skip questions, need to flip tiles over, use the ""reveal map"", do the mini games (that are completely irrelevant to the game), or play the treasure tiles? all of it is pointless, it seems like the developers built a game to make ad revenue. The questions don\'t get harder, so why is there a level system at all? What are the stars for??', 'I don\'t like the daily bonus change at all. We already get numerous ""free"" bonus items during gameplay. It costs an arm and a leg to use those ""free"" bonuses that you win. I loved the game, the questions, the challenge. I think it would be nice to have a, ""How to Play"", or ""Instructions"" instead of having to figure everything out myself. That would help a lot! Thanks', 'I downloaded this just for fun but spent over an hour on my first play. I love it! Also I am shocked at how much information I have retained over my 52 years! I am an avid reader... and truly believe that, along with a somewhat photographic memory is to be accredited. My thanks to my mother for my love of reading that she instilled in me as a child!', 'I was having a good time and this game was going great until all of a sudden I got notified that I was dead: I had no lives. Never did I see anything telling me how many I had, or how I would lose them: only that in order to continue the game, I had to watch videos. And this After I had accrued a couple of hundred bonus points. No thank you. Consider it uninstalled.', ""Love a good quiz. Not liking the recent format update. Less 'character'."", 'I have just started playing this game. It is great fun, I love the variety of questions and the interactivity of the game.', ""If you like trivia games and hate ads, this is the app for you. It's easy to navigate, the questions are smart and come with some background info, and you only have to watch a few seconds of an ad when you answer wrong. I also like that there's a comment section under each question, it's a fun way to interact with other players. Overall this game is very entertaining and informative."", ""I adore this game. I was immediately impressed by the little inserts of information offered on the subject in question upon answering. And the little side games are decent. Just wish I could c the timer. Perhaps its rt there n I'm just not paying attention bc im in the zone. Complaint: click hard several times to make it even harder. Then again i just got my a** kicked"", ""I have to say, out of all the trivia game I have played, this is my favorite. Its easy but can also be a challenge which I love. I'm also learning alot. When you get a right answer and or a wrong it still explains to you as to why the answer is what it is. I love that. Alot of the answers I find I get right, but I never fully knew the extent as to why it was what it was. If I could give more then 5 stars I would! You should download this!"", 'Fun game but what the #&@$! is the point of the Flip Tile, Open Map, and Show Exit ""rewards""?? They don\'t seem to help in any way! Get a wrong answer and get punished by having to watch the same freaking 30 second ad over and over. How about fixing these obvious flaws?']"

Sometimes you can accomplish the task without the hint, but I'm finding you can't do things or they have to be done specifically (like pull the cookie apart to break it instead of just tapping it) and you have to use a clue/watch an ad to figure out what the game wants.

Kind regards ellie mae', ""Easy puzzle, then ad, easy puzzle then another ad... now pick a bonus, another ad... 30 levels into the game the ad format changes and the ads run even longer.

I can just learn so much with this! Just one problem though; Mount Everest isn't actually the highest mountain in the world. Mauna Kea is, about 1.5x higher than Mount Everest."", 'Need updates for new backgrounds and characters', 'This game is sooo fun you should really give it a try', 'The game itself is novel and fun. The characters are whimsical and the basic premise are all great. The problem comes with the English translation of many of the questions. ""Do snails not have teeth?"" Try figuring out the grammar. Yes or no really could defensibly work here because of the way English handles double negatives and it\'s that nuance that ruins the whole experience for me. Of it were translated more consistently I would highly recommend it.', ""Now that I can move my person back and forth, I think its a pretty cool game. The only complaint I have are the answers to some of the questions. You think you are answering it right (and you are by the wsy you look at the question) and it ends up being wrong. I think there might be a language translation barriar? And I really don't believe you are always playing against other people either. Nonw the less its kinda fun."", ""Theoretically this game could be a lot of fun, if it were not for the fact that the questions themselves are all either horribly written or wrong. At least 5 of the last 10 questions I got were grammatically so bad there was no way to answer them. Things like double and triple negatives, or questions to which T or F were awkward answers. Theres no way to report or flag them either so I assume they'll never not disappear again for the first time or reappear not then but in the now. /s"", ""Love the idea. What I just hate is you playing with bots, not with real people. It didn't make any intense in game...."", 'Fairly fun game, with a decent concept and execution. However, it has two major flaws that prevent a higher rating: Firstly, the battle royale format of having 100 characters whittled down to one by successive elimination implies that it\'s a multiplayer game. In actuality, all of the ""competitors"" are quite obviously AI. There is no competitive multiplayer at all, which takes a lot of the the fun out for me personally. Secondly, a lot of the questions are poorly worded or have mistakes.', 'Fun, but some questions are wrong or worded funny. For example, One question asked ""Are there 5 players in a basketball game?"" The obvious answer is no, because both teams need an even number of players, and professional games have 2 teams of 5 players (on the court). So I chose false... and got it wrong. The explanation was ""A basketball team has 5 players."" But that wasn\'t the question that was asked...', 'Decently fun game, but i have a couple issues with it. A couple questions make some claims that are not proven. One says ""cow farts and burps are the cause of global warming."" There is no definitive proof as to the cause of global warming. Also, many questions have double negatives and it can be exhausting to figure out the correct answer. Good concept, poor execution.', ""I love the idea. It's generally fun to play and, and the unlocks are well done. That being said, they struggle with the core of the game: trivia. You'll learn something from one question and apply it to another only for them to tell you you're wrong, yet you used the correct answer on another question to answer it. Further investigation shows that many of their answers just aren't correct. I can't give a trivia game with inaccurate trivia a good rating."", 'Game is complete garbage. The concept is great, but, when you have incorrect trivia in a trivia game, the ""trivia"" aspects fall apart. For example: A question asked, ""Did the same person who invented the light bulb also invent the electric chair?"". Which is of course false, but the devs are convinced that Harold Brown invented both. Harold Brown invented neither one of those things! Don\'t make a trivia game if you don\'t know trivia.', 'Many of these questions are flat out wrong or too vague. I think this is because of poor translation by the game developers. One question says that fleas have wings. THEY DO NOT. Maybe they mistranslated fleas from ""flies?"" Next, many of the questions are just vague. One of them asked ""Did war break out during the world cup?"" Which war? Which world cup? What year? These questions need to be fixed or have an option to report them for having issues.', 'this game is a fun concept but it falls short on so many levels. there are many, many questions in here that are answered incorrectly. (For example, there is one that says: are spiders insects. The answer is no, however it says the answer is yes and then tells you that spiders are arachnids... arachnids are animals not insects.) there are also a large amount of the questions that are worded in confusing ways, and many more questions that are just impossible to know. Uninstalled', ""Fun idea but so many incorrect questions. For example 'Goldfish do not sleep'. The game said this was true but it is not. Goldfish do sleep whilst not in the same way we do it is certainly considered sleep. Also a lot of the questions are worded in a way that the answer become obvious even if you didn't know the answer. Also the game doesn't have much progression. One can unlock the final stage quite quickly and can already see a repititon of questions."", ""‚ö†cannot play other sounds (i.e. music) from other app while playing this game‚ö†. it's a trivia machine, obviously, with cute and funny graphics. However, the questions are often lost in translation. I can understand this because the developer is not native English. Also a lot of the questions are within Asian culture context. Please do improve."", ""I really like this game--it's silly and fun. My only real gripe is that not all the questions and answers are worded in a way that makes sense. At best, it causes confusion and at worst, makes some answers technically incorrect. Unfortunately, I can't find a way to flag these awkward questions/answers. With a little grammatical revision, I'd totally give a higher score!"", 'It was fun at first, but some of the questions are too ambiguous. ""Can a lion\'s roar be heard a mile away?"" the game said this was wrong, and that it can be heard 5 miles away. So doesn\'t that mean you can definitely hear that a mile away? Too ambiguous. Otherwise good game design, nice graphics. Please improve on the quality of your trivia. I\'ve noticed a few scientific ones that were very dubious, but cannot remember off the to of my head.', 'Too many errors in translation. It will ask you oddly worded questions or just mark you wrong for answering the question correctly. It is a neat game, but when one of the features of the game is to unlock new characters, and some of those are locked behind winning rounds consecutively, it makes it impossible when there are errors in your questions.', 'This is a fun game, but you need someone to better check your questions. I look up each answer I get wrong to enlighten myself, but sometimes I lose on questions even though I\'m correct. For example, ""A bee flaps its wings 11000 times per SECOND."" This is false, but the game says it\'s TRUE. A bee can flap its wings up to 230 times per second, or over 11000 times per MINUTE.', 'This game was interesting when it was 1 vs 10, 50 and 100 it was pretty good! :) But when it got to individual, it got kind of boring. All i suggest is add more mini games so that you could improve your game and have more 5 star reviews! :) i think i didnt play properly. but this is a nice game! i got some more information. Thank you!', 'Poor grammar, which is challenging in a timing based game when you have to double check you understand the question. Also, the questions aren\'t always factual, or the wording makes it very misleading. For example, a question they gave was ""Cows burps and farts are the cause of global warming."" Its misleading because they are not *the* single cause of global warming, nor are they the leading cause of global warming. The game reminds me of one I played as a kid on the Wii, but poorly executed.', 'More time is spent watching ads than actually ""playing"" the game, if you can call it gameplay. All you do is move your avatar to the Yes or No options and pray you don\'t get killed. As other reviews suggest, the answers are not always correct, so it really is a random draw. Outside of unlocking other avatars there isn\'t much replay value to this.', 'This is a nice game. It\'s well put together and looks nice. However, a lot of the questions are worded poorly or just incorrect. :/ For example: 1) Do such and such type of owl hunt during the day? App answer: No, they are nocturnal. Actuality: they do sometimes hunt during the late day. true, they primarily do not, but not always. 2) ""Something-or-other"" is the Indian word for -something-else- app: yes, it is problem: Indian? Did you mean Hindi, Bengali, Telugu? Or maybe native American? :/', ""Seemed cool, then found out it wasn't online. The AI can be pretty dumb, they get an answer right then the same exact question appears again and they change their minds and get it wrong. The choices of the AI is completely random, so it isn't really a challenge. Then I found out you just get the same questions on repeat. Game was fun for about 20 mins, then you've basically done everything."", 'Great premise, but Please troubleshoot trivia accuracy. Fleas do not have wings. Nothing more frustrating than playing a trivia game that\'s wrong about its questions. Thanks. Also frustrating... question is ""Is Portuguese the official language of 10 countries?"" select yes, die. Death message states ""Portuguese is the official language of 10 countries."" So i was right and lost anyway. No more for me, thanks.', ""okay, there are a lot of questions on there that are misleading or literally straight up wrong. grammar is an issue (I'd assume because it was translated), and it is not an online game. its singleplayer. I feel like a lot of 'facts' in here are from either memes or a quick little google search and there really aren't that many questions. played for like 20 mins and got repeats ones. I mean I'll give them credit for trying, but it's not a game that they put a whole lotta care into."", ""i love this game. simple and informative. i feel smarter. haha. the characters are very cute. i lobe to collect them all. however i have to uninstall it because i think the moving graphic from the characters like they are running seem too fast. my eye was distracted and very disturbed that it feel pain. other than that, there is a question about male mosquito suck blood. i had to answer 'o' to pass the question. overall, this is a fun game."", ""Broken answers about 10-20% of the time. The wording is mostly the problem, factually it seems to be accurate but the game triggers a lot of does and does not questions which end up flipping the meaning of the answer the wrong way and the game doesn't acknowledge that you have chosen correctly. Also in about 20% of the times I lose, the answer I chose was exactly the answer the game states as correct. It is fun other than that and visually appealing with all the different characters."", 'A fun concept and I do enjoy playing. Games are quick and gameplay is simple. Makes it good for passing a brief bit of time, or binging if you like. Problem is a LOT of the trivia is misleading, misinterpreted, or just plain wrong. Seriously, there are a lot of inaccuracies. As quick and fun as it is each new incorrect ""fact"" saps away a bit of the joy.', 'I enjoyed the concept of this game for a couple days. Some of the questions were poorly worded, but I was willing to let it go. Then today I get ""Are spiders harmful?"" Obviously I selected yes it proceeds to tell me I was wrong, ""Spiders are not harmful."" This is false. Extremely false. Spiders are VERY harmful to insects. Plenty of humans have been harmed and even died from spiders. With that being said, they don\'t seek out to harm humans. This is true, but neither falling trees. Come on..', 'really good game however some of the questions are a bit too vague and have typing errors. also when you get one wrong it doesnt always tell you the actual answer, for example there was a question about whether a certain tree had a certain type of leaf and i got it wrong and it just said ""it does not have said type of leaf"" rather than saying what leaf it did have. also the dog belly button question is a bit silly because they only have belly buttons for a small period of time after birth', 'great concept but a lot of the trivia answers are flat out wrong, and some of the questions are very poorly or ambiguously worded. The developers should have an ingame option for users to rate questions or give feedback on question quality and answer accuracy. Here are a couple of examples - question: can elephants swim? game says no but a quick google search confirms that they can swim. question: are spiders harmful? game says no, but getting bit by a poisonous spider is harmful.', ""To be fair, this game clearly wasn't designed by English speakers, and the translation is infinitely better than any of my own attempts to translate would be, but it is still really poorly translated. There shouldn't be so many double negatives in the questions. Also, as someone who does a lot of trivia, these questions aren't really skill-based. The best trivia games are ones that test knowledge which might have been accumulated for reasons other than doing well at trivia games..."", 'Very addictive game, great time killer! My only ehh about this game is 90% of the time if you answer incorrectly they dont state why. They just re word the question. Examples: ""is blank blank population over a certain amount?"" -I get question wrong ""blank blank population is over a certain amount"" soo.. what is the population? ""Are spiders harmful?"" -I get question wrong ""Spiders aren\'t harmful"" Why!? I NEED TO KNOW. Other then that it\'s a great game though. Would totally recommend.', 'Its a good idea, I really like the idea of a trivia sort of battle royale, but the issue is the trivia. Some questions and answers don\'t line up with facts and even the actual reasoning it provides as to why. The other issue with the questions is when it says something like ""This is over 50% blah blah"", you answer true, but it\'s false because its actually over 75%. Well, if its above 75% it\'s also above 75%. In general the trivia questions need work, and a lot of it, but this game could be fun.', 'The concept is great and I can see how it could be addicting. The horrible grammar and misspelled words are the first things that really takes away its appeal, though. If you try to work past that, it gets worse when some of the answers they have listed are incorrect, which then makes you incorrect. I would think getting this far into creating the app those issues would be a considerably easy fix', ""While the game is initially somewhat enjoyable, it quickly becomes uninteresting when you realize that you're just playing against AI, if you can even call it that. In the one hour I have played, I have seen MULTIPLE repeated questions, and on one occasion I had the same question back to back. There are plenty of typos and grammatical errors in the questions which is somewhat excusable, but sometimes the questions are worded with double negatives, causing unnecessary confusion. A bad trivia game""]"

Sporcle,com.sporcle,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sporcle&hl=en&gl=us,"If you rule the local pub on trivia night, or just dream of the day you will, Sporcle is the perfect app for you. This popular quiz game for Android has got all the bells and whistles. More importantly, it's got great quizzes!

- A Quiz for Every Occasion
""Oh sure,"" you're thinking. ""Another app with 10 or 15 lame quizzes."" Au contraire! Sporcle for Android has thousands of inventive and challenging trivia games. Running the gamut from Entertainment to Religion, from Sports to Literature, there's a quiz here for anyone and everyone. You can browse through 15 different categories or simply select a random quiz and start playing.

Here's just a small sampling of the types of trivia tests you'll find on Sporcle: ""50 Largest U.S. Cities."" ""Name that Sitcom."" ""Ancient Wonders."" ""Baby Names from Shakespeare."" (?) ""Guess Your NBA Team."" ""SNL Cast Blitz."" ""Famous Biologists."" (??) And on and on.

These aren't your grandpa's multiple-choice quizzes, either--each one has a written answer that you must provide. As soon as you type the right answer, BING, it pops into the right spot.  When you type in a wrong answer however, the app just sits and stares at you, quietly judging you.  Play for time or play for fun, the decision is yours.

- How Do You Measure Up?
Sporcle scores your performance on every quiz and stores the information right in the app, so you can track which ones you've taken and how you did. You can also get more in-depth statistics on each game, seeing how your performance stacks up against others who have taken that quiz. And don't worry; each quiz reveals the correct answers once you've completed it, so you don't have to wonder. You can also take the same quiz again if you like.

- It Gets Better
One of the best things about Sporcle is the ""connectivity"" it provides. You can see comments from other players about each quiz and compare your score against theirs right on your phone--but that's just the beginning. You can then go online, create an account on Sporcle.com, and have even more fun. On the site you can comment on quizzes you've taken, rate them, view all kinds of statistics, invite and connect with your friends, post your results to Facebook and Twitter, and more. You can even create your own quiz.

Even if you just stick to the app, there's more than enough to keep you busy and entertained for a long while. It features thousands of quizzes pre-loaded in every category--and you don't have to have network access to play them. Just download the Android app and start exercising your brain. With Sporcle, there's always a new challenge waiting for you.

Thanks,
Sporcle","[""Bought this cause I enjoy some of the quizzes on the sporcle website. Come to find out any quiz with a map doesn't work on this app. My advice to anyone who has the same interests as I had, just go onto the website on your phone and save your money, because if you pay for this you get a worse version of what is already available free."", 'Nowhere near as good as the online version. It should have been reasonably straightforward to make the same map based games and identify the flag games. Either they are not here or they are impossible to find. Not truly terrible but very disappointing.', ""This app could be so much better. Scores are separate from the desktop version, map quizzes are unplayable, no dark mode, previous searches aren't saved, search functionality generally is pretty weak (the list goes on). Only managed 2 stars because I enjoy the quizzes, and the community writes those!"", ""This is a garbage app for Android. You can't see your badges, prior scores aren't visible, the search feature is weak, many quizzes are unplayable (e.g., a quiz that asks us to find capitals on a map but the map isn't visible). Don't buy this. It will make you hate Sporcle."", ""Such a poor port of the website. It feels like it was designed and built in 2009. Navigation is clunky, and it's missing the fun site elements like badges. Two stars because most of the quizzes are there, but not very organized."", 'I really enjoyed sporcle for desk top. Was excited to see it on android for phone. Not a lot of features... pretty basic, but serviceable. Worked fine up until a couple days ago. Now its glitchy, shuts down unexpectedly, and opens the quizzes with times up.', ""Really poor interface, a lot of the games don't even work like map games as it's not able to display a map. Really disappointed that I paid for this"", 'The app works fine, but it\'s missing a lot of pretty basic features that would seriously enhance the experience. - Your taken quizzes don\'t synchronise between the PC and mobile app, even when logged in - The ""Random Quiz"" button, basically always, shows me quizzes I\'ve already taken. The ""history"" function exists for this purpose. When I click ""Random quiz"" I want to take a new quiz. - There\'s no ""not interested"" function to block quizzes you don\'t want to take. Disappointing for a paid app', 'Disappointing. Worse than the website in far too many ways - amount of quizzes, UX, recommendations, personalisation. Would be vaguely acceptable for a free app but not worth buying at all', 'Use it daily. Even use it via my computer. Usually great/interesting trivia. Great for anyone who loves trivia.', ""Can't find certain quizzes that I can find on the desktop version of the website. You are better off just using their browser version."", ""the latest update seems to have broken the app. I updated the app this morning and now everytime I click on a quiz I am greeted by 'can not retrieve quiz data'. I would avoid this app until this is resolved. Apart from this issue I enjoy the app as it passes the time on long work journeys."", 'Best. Trivia. App. Ever. Download this app now. You will not be disappointed.', ""Waste of money. There are no clickable games and though I could log into my account, which I've had for years, all of my stats and badges are not available on the app. Most games are missing."", ""Lastest update nuked the app. Sporcle appear to have bitten off more than they could chew by adding clickable quizzes to the app. Here's hoping they get it fixed soon, because it's previously been a solid app."", ""Annoyed. I've just bought this app and it won't let me play any quizzes! I've tried un installing and re installing I've lost my refund. It's not on.. I want it to work or I want my money back. Disgusting"", ""None of the games open saying they can't download the game data but the phone is connected to the Internet. I'm immediately requesting a refund, I expect better than this from sporcle..."", ""Doesn't work. Just says it it can't retrieve data. Looks from the other ratings that the latest update made this happen. So why on earth would you let people buy an app you know doesn't work. Absolute scam. Stay away."", ""Just bought the app and it doesn't work.. Could not retrieve quiz data error on every quiz. Hope it's going to get fixed soon, otherwise it's a nice waste of money"", 'play on website and love it so thought I would download app. Very disappointed, limited choice of quizzes on the app. I often request random but found the same quizzes were suggested. Not happy that I had to pay for such a poor service', ""awesome time wasting app. my one feature that I wish was added would be to have clickable quizzes not show up as I do not wish to play them. there's way too many of them. great app nonetheless"", 'Really good app for easy quizzing. Would love to see a night mode so I am not blinded while playing', 'Unable to play image quizzes like in the free browser version.', 'i love sporcle, its super fun to always have new and different ways to challenge myself! the developers are also super friendly and helpful and prompt to correct issues with the app.', 'Pretty good. You should however add a way to organize the bookmarks. Maybe it would be a good idea to add playlists like you uave on the website.', 'Do not waste your money. The app for android is missing many key features. Now that the site is more mobile friendly, the app is redundant.', ""Love the app, have had it for 2 years plus, but now is the first time where it won't load anything, please fix Sporcle"", ""It's OK. Doesn't have a fraction of the games or types of games from the site. Kinda disappointed."", ""Latest update has made the app nonfunctional. can't retrieve data to start any quizzes."", 'Frustrating app. Search functionality isnt up to the website version and not all of the content haa made it to the mobile format.', ""Haven't been able to play because every time I open the app, it says it's checking in."", 'Nicely made app but doesnt have any of the map/visual quizzes that you get on the website.', 'The app immediately crashes on opening. i even deleted and reinstalled. bad use for $2', ""Waste of money for using on a phone,Can't create a quiz which is why I purchased it.Have to go on the laptop still"", ""Can't see how to load quizzes I've created on the website. This was the only reason I bought this. Disappointing."", 'What a waste of money... Every game I try to play does not work on my device.', ""It's fine but doesn't come with the maps!"", ""I didn't even know Sporcle had an app until my girlfriend told me. Brilliant app, worth the money !"", ""it's a shame that a lot of the quizzes aren't there, especially picture quizzes"", 'Does not have the quality of a paid app. Booooo']"

It\'s called ""no ads,"" but the truth is, there are TONS of ads, it\'s just that they are for in-game purchases. A total bait-and-switch. I should report them to Google.', 'Just updated and I HATE the layout! Go back to the older version! Ad free? Not any more! Get rid of your pop up ads to buy your stuff!

Great game though when you don't have all the glitchy pop ups from a money hungry app."", 'Used to be good. No more. I paid for no ads.

QUIZ UP.', ""I love this game, but don't like how the ads to buy trivia spins cover the screen every time you start a game"", ""Everything in this app is just a cash grab. It used to be a simple trivia game, but now it's overloaded with extra junk.

You can report questions, but I end up having to report every other question for errors."", ""If I didn't have the ad free version, I would not enjoy this as much. But it's fun when you don't have ads :D"", 'I paid for the ad free version as it was cheap and I hate having to view ads. I figured this would be a good idea but I found out it was a COMPLETE WASTE of money. Its true, you no longer have to view ads between games which is nice, however after every single turn you complete the Game gives you a ""free"" spin where you get a low value ""Prize"". These prizes do not appeal to me at all and I have to skip them by pressing a big ""X"" then another PAY TO SPIN thing appears that I have to exit as well.', 'I absolutely love this game. However, after most recent update (12/3 & 12/5) experiencing same ""check internet connection"" message many others are seeing. I am unable to use this at all. Once issue is fixed, I will update review, but not until. This is not the first time issues have rendered the app unusable and it is a bit beyond frustrating.', 'Making it too easy to make accidental purchases! I loved this game but after every turn it asks me if I want to spend $12. I don\'t have this game to spend real money. It would take only 2 taps to spend money if you have a card on file. I deleted my payment information just because of this. I already paid to not see the ads and now all I see is ""buy this"" anyway.', 'Bought the ad free version as I liked the game so much. Now constantly have an annoying pig where you can purchase something extra. Most annoying however is the spinning wheel popping up, making it easy to make an accidental purchase. Which I did last night. I could not find a way to cancel this purchase. The annoyance of this will now have me uninstalling the game to avoid a further wasting of my money. Super disappointed.', ""I loved this game until my last update. Now it won't even let me into the game, I get a check internet connection message. Been this was for 4 days now, so I'm losing out on survivor, playing with my friends fairly, and my bonus points and such. VERY FRUSTRATING!! Ready to quit the game and find a new game that works!"", ""Even though you pay for the game to not have ads, they constantly push micro purchases on you which hinders game play. As well if the game has a new mode (currently lunar New year missions) it will come into the foreground of the app until you 'x' it out and that will eat into your time if you're playing a game, which are times mind you."", 'I really enjoy this game, I purchased the no ads game so I can play. For about a month now everytime I try to play survival, it says there is an error or it gives me 20 seconds to answer a survival question. I can be in the middle of the game with just me and another person left and it errors. Not only does it do that, but it takes my turns.', 'Great game and great customer service. Had an issue and they emailed me back right away.', 'I have the ad free version. I love the game but I have 3 major issues with this app. First, they push annoying notifications every 2 hours, during the day. Not your turn notifications, but other annoying ones. 2nd, they brought back that annoying floating pig. 3rd issue is at the end, they added a spin wheel that says ""Spin for $9.99"". Is this really neccessary to get us to pay more money? I am seriously considering uninstalling this app.', ""I paid money so I wouldn't see ads, but now after every turn I have to click through popups trying to get me to spend more money. I bought this game because in the free version the ads are so annoying, but this one is still annoying. If they don't fix it soon I will delete. Also I hate that pig, it interupts game play."", ""Thnx for bringing back the cards!!.. Pls understand that most of the people playing this version are old customers, who fell in love with the game as it used to be.. We do appreciate some of the new features, but we want back the ones that were taken away, like the playing spins, frames, etc.. We are actually investing money in this game.. It should be way better compared to the free version, & not just one 'with less ads'.. Pls fix issues, & let us have what we want!! .. Thnx & Happy New Year!!"", ""It's a good game, very informative. However, the option to create challenge games with your friends disappeared a long time ago and I wish you'd bring it back. That was a fun way to use the game. And dang it, please get rid of the piggy bank on the screen! It's in the way of other items you need to see!"", 'Ad free. No longer fun. Same complaints as everyone else. Lost a hat I purchased with an upgrade. Many questions don\'t make sense as they are poorly worded. I enjoy trivia but am not really interested in playing against others.

4 Player Reactor (Multiplayer),coolcherrytrees.games.reactor4,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=coolcherrytrees.games.reactor4&hl=en&gl=us,"4 Player Reactor is the original fast, clean and funny reaction game for two to four players on the same device.

Challenge your friends (or enemies) to a multiplayer battle of reflexes, wits and knowledge! Great as a bar game, ice breaker or to decide who has to do the dishes.

One of 28 (we continuously add more) exciting mini-games is displayed on screen, and if you think the answer is correct, hit your button faster than your opponents to get a point. But be careful - hit it at the wrong time, and you'll lose one. After a few seconds, the next multiplayer challenge starts - and you can make up for lost points or extend your lead against your adversary!

---- Benefits of 4 Player Reactor: ----
28 (and growing) games with four difficulties each ranging from easy to insane -- that means over 100 combinations! A single-player training mode when you want to hone your skills for the next encounter, no advertisements whatsoever, and lots of extra settings for even more multiplayer fun!

---- Up to four players on the same device! ----
Nobody needs to wait, two, three or four players, one device, at the same time! Frantic multiplayer action is guaranteed for all ages! Some of the included mini-games require pure reaction, so the younger you are the better, while other mini-games require knowledge of countries in the world and puzzle-solving skills. Who can be the best in all of them?

---- Lots of dynamic Minigames! ----
There are 28 mini-games included, and they span all sorts of areas. For example: Who can find the sad face in a group of smiley faces? Does the shown capital city really belong to the country? Can the mouse navigate the maze to the cheese? Hit when the screen turns white! When is the changing labyrinth completed from corner to corner? Has the Countdown hit Zero? React when the Tic-Tac-Toe game is complete! And there's many more!

---- Old-School clean graphics ----
Sporting super-clean and slick graphics, 4 Player Reactor doesn't try to overwhelm or distract you with fancy effects or big explosions.This also means it runs on even the oldest and crankiest of Android devices! Everything in the game has been tested on all kinds of screens, and it runs beautifully on tablets! 

---- Settings to suit everyone! ----
There's a no-brainer ""Quick Game"" mode that allows you to jump right into the action. But if you hate math, or you only want to play that mode with the smiley faces, or you want a really really long game, you can change everything in the advanced settings menu! And if you're trying to learn a different language, we've got you covered: The game has been translated into 25 mysterious languages such as German, French, Chinese, Persian, Finnish, and many many more.

---- Independent developer team! -----
I'm an independent game developer and made the game all by myself - which explains the basic graphics (I like to think of them as clean ;)). I hope you like my game, and I totally crave your feedback, just send me an email at robin@coolcherrytrees.com.",Match your reflexes against your friends in many action-packed game modes!,"100,000+",100000,4.70354,4427,1120,2.49,False,USD,,1.7M,1.5,cool cherry trees,cool+cherry+trees,robin@coolcherrytrees.com,http://reactor.coolcherrytrees.com,http://aipanic.com/reactor-license/license.html,4726049625018542945,Trivia,GAME_TRIVIA,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/GIrXE3HyL7U8Z6SdHrWv6MDoZUPjF6467VlUhn0-zRGN_kKLbBxsqMY-niGW5VdjOa8u,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ULyEAWc1xA5zKLqItQnJmq7R4HZ5CfhxcX-hRGEWxIQZ1oMqDhfDkGdYY964-yuCbA,Everyone,,,,,1403877214,1.99,"v1.99:

Game modes are very interesting.', 'Worth the few bucks.', 'This game is the best multiplayer experience on android.  Always adding new games and never the same game twice.  Me and the lil lady play this anytime we are board or waiting on food or service.  Exceptional in all areas the adaptive difficulty means no one ever gets too far ahead and keeps the action alive.  I wish more developers realized that people enjoy competitive multiplayer, however this is really the only game that fills that need.  Thanks so much for this wonderful game!', ""I've been using this game as a drinking game for a time now, and I must say, it is by FAR one of the best and most appreciated drinking games I've played. Drink when you press wrong and drink the difference between you and the winner in the end. Everyone is willing to join in, as it is nothing about sharing secrets or stuff, just  click as fast as possible, and as the night goes on you will drink more and more!"", ""This game is fantastic and well worth the money. It's perfect for a restaurant table setup with friends and it's so awesome it can all be done on one phone. I hadn't planed this game in a couple years, just redownloaded it, and was pleased to see the developer is still adding new puzzles! Fantastic work, keep it up!"", 'Very good fun and time passer. A few bugs:  1. Illusion: Tracks is far too small and hard to see on Nexus 5 screen.  2. Pairs always shows a matching pair in the screen right away. It used to take at least 5 seconds for a pair to appear on the screen.', 'I had 2 player reactor a few years ago on my first android phone and havent had it for years so I decided to buy this 4 player reactor since I remember it being so fun. Is there an option to turn off the constantly shrinking button for the player who consistently wins rounds? I am not a fan of that feature and I believe it makes the game unfair for the player.', 'One of the best games you can find in the store for multiple players. It became a tradition for me when waiting for the order in the restaurant with my friends. Its a good game but if you consider updating the challenges since you memorize the answers after a while. Overall worth the money.', ""Continuously showed false math statements... waited 5 minutes none showed.  Also hit +0.03s on the count down and it added many millions of seconds to my time... something isn't right.  Fun game regardless."", ""It should not be mandatory that the hit button get's smaller when the player is far ahead. I see the adaptive mode on the free version and the one I bought it just does not exist. It really bothers me!"", 'one of the few good offline multiplayer games available for Android. perfect for those waiting times in restaurants or airports when with family. the feature to make things difficult for the leader is great and evens things out pretty fast.', ""The game is awesome for certain situations. Very fun and gets people to pay attention to each other a little bit instead of playing with their phones at a restaurant for example. Some games cause the phone to lag, which really shouldn't be a problem with such a simple game."", 'Quick, easy to learn and fun for when you need to kill time with friends. Different types of strategic games for everyone to try out and master. Good for all ages! Loved the two-person version so much that I bought the four person upgrade.', ""I've used this app mainly on road trips with friends. Its great if your ever stuck with nothing to do with a few people. Everyone seems to enjoy it."", 'basically the first app I open while hanging out with my friends, waiting for foods to come. simple yet exciting, best multiplayer android app!', 'In the area section,  even if you tap the correct answer it wont say it is correct', 'Really fun to play with friends!

It's just not there in the options menu anymore."", ""Loved the two player. got the four player paid version. Great app. Amazing to kill time while traveling. It's perfect as a drinking game too!"", 'After having a blast with 2 Player Reactor, I am proud to say that this is my very first Android Market purchase! 5 stars', 'Does not save my ""premium"" status when offline/roaming so only 18 instead of 31 games are available.

I read the FAQs and this is is a common issue apparently! How on earth they haven't got this common bug fixed, I don't know!

I have never been so disappointed in an app I've downloaded."", ""Awful This is one of the worst games I have ever played. The single player game is unfair as the computer always plays first, usually gets a low scoring answer and it you don't beat it it's game over. The game you can play with other people is also awful since the other player doesn't play their turn in the middle of the game. Avoid! I have played better free games."", 'Tricky to review. I largely enjoy the gameplay, but I do agree with other criticisms regarding the multiple choice options - it does dilute the experience. This, however, is not my issue with the app. The biggest issue is the problems signing in and connectivity. If I log off my Wifi when leaving my home, I have to then attempt to ""log in with Facebook"" to the app again when I reconnect and this does not work for a long time!! Is this a glitch? Very frustrating!!!', ""Utter garbage. The layout of the rounds is nothing like the show and there's no room for thought until the final round (if you make it).

Especially when using a hint. In 2 part rounds it only let's me see the the first part but picks an answer for me? Waste of money"", ""Just like the show, so it accomplishes that! The final round is the best bit, where you have to input your own answers (although I'd like to see it ignore accented letters...). Playing against the computer in the early rounds feels more like chance than skill though... e.g. the computer usually scores <10pts, so rather than choosing an answer you know is correct, more often than not to win you have to guess an obscure answer and *hope* it is right and less than their score."", ""This game costs quite a bit but then you only start the game with a standard pack.

What even is the reason you need so much money?

But what the effing hell is up with those new ads? One isn't able to tap the screen without being redirected to the playstore... That's really unnerving... I've stood up until now with all the previous ads but these ones are really making me think twice about keep playing... I know you make money from them but surely there have to be some limits to the way they work..."", ""Such a shame that such a fun game has so many ads. It also glitches frequently and you lose possible points that you could have won. I have lost survival mode multiple times because it wouldn't load. It really was a fun game, very unfortunate."", ""The game is super fun and I want to keep on playing BUT it keeps on glitching and lagging and I know it's not my phone because none of my other games do it.

I can GUARANTEE that if the frequency of ads dropped then the player base would increase, its that simple."", ""I love this game however their survival mode is trash even though it gives you the most points league-wise. The questions aren't vetted and a lot of them have incorrect answers which isn't fair at all when they are trying to get you to spend money and use your points. Big letdown."", ""I love the game and competition but there are so many ads not to mention the different options you have to wade through that as soon as I finish my open games I will uninstall because it's so very aggravating. I hate it cause I do love the game but all of the above I mention just makes it not worth it!!!"", 'It\'s a good game, but whenever I am playing survival mode, the loading takes forever. Because of this I always lose because ""I took too long to answer""', 'Newest vidoe ads, which appear to be mostly political, shrink the play area of the screen and completely cover the buttons you need to tap to continue playing. I get that ads are a part of a free game, but selling out to the political ads and letting them completely overtake the game is ridiculous.', ""Its a great game. Been playing for a long time. But out of all the games I play this one has a TON of ad's. That gets irritating especially when you're in the middle of a round. Otherwise its a great game for testing one's knowledge."", ""Glitchy and Buggy: Has lots of bugs, will make you watch an ad in order to continue and then when the ad is finished it will bug out. I have a new phone running new OS, so it's not my fault. Don't download if you want an ad every 45 seconds of playing to continue, only to have the app screw you over."", 'The best quiz app by far, not retarded questions about the surname of the cat of the captain of titanic. Good questions thats more or less ""easy"" if you\'re assertive within the different categories. And its not too Americanized either, which is something most quizgames seem to be, hence there will be questions about american history, but also european, asian and world hustory, the sport category is probably the only Americanized which 4-5 times is questions about American NFL/NBA teams.', ""I didn't even get a chance to login to Get The Chance To Play!

You get what you ""pay"" for', ""Was once really fun however now ads make it basically unplayable. After every single round an add pops up as well as 3 different deals and optional ads to watch for another turn. If this game didn't turn into such a big money grab it would actually be fun."", 'Used to be a great app but the amount of ads and marketing methods to get you to spend money have gotten carried away.', ""An excellent trivia app and a lot of fun. Very addicting. Lots of ads but I guess that's the price of admission."", ""Way too many ads. The over saturation is ridiculous. I understand there will be some ads given its a free game. But it's honestly almost every 30 seconds. This game is not at all worth a download."", 'The ads bother me sometimes since there is always ones popping up, even when I choose not to watch the ad. Great game though, my boyfriend and I love it', ""Fun game but way too many ads. Ads every other question is ridiculous. I saw that the ad free version wasn't any better. I used to play this all the time now I remember why I uninstalled it."", ""It's only been 10 days since KobeBryant died and they already have a trivia question about it. Yes trivia crack, TOO SOON. Free has loads of ads, but most are skippable and its still enjoyable to play."", 'There are way too many ads, a ton of glitches, also, some of the questions are NOT correct! I have verified this personally.. I question why I waste my time with this app.', ""It would be fun if you weren't bombarded by ads. They'll pop up when you're actually playing and you're being timed, and no, the timer doesn't stop while the ad plays. Find a different trivia app."", 'Ridiculous amounts of ads and pop ups within the game. After getting every question wrong I have to press X (close) atleast 5 times and wait 15 seconds for an ad to finish. Many questions are also from the wrong category.', ""Initially enjoyed the game. But the number of questions which are poorly phrased or misleading is frustrating. There are so many answers which are incorrect it's bizarre. If the app were to allow for a question enquiry with the view to edit, it would make all the difference. One gets the feeling that the developers have done their job and are letting it run on its own.Trivia is not only a way to test your knowledge, but a great way to learn new things of interest.

There is only one free category, so I bought a new category for 99 coins just to see what it was like. You get the category for 2 hours, but it only pays 1 coin per drawing!! Ridiculous! Please go back to your previous format! The game was much more fun then. Does anyone even read these reviews??"", 'cannot see the game when other player finsihed their turn. too many ads. unplayable.', 'Very fun to play and pass time with i just wish there were no ads. Or an ad free option', 'Too many ads. Whenever you hit the X to exit out it opens a new window its annoying af.', 'Great game... One bug... The game is great, a lot of fun. Although the updates should include many more words to add to the selection, as I am drawing words repeatedly. The one bug is that sometimes when drawing, the screen blips and an error is caused showing the drawing half split into the display. It looks like the top of the drawing ends up near the bottom and the bottom goes to the top, with some of the drawing missing. Also, it needs more pen size options, and square brushes too. üòä', ""You (the person working on this game) might like to add at least one pop-up, offering the purchase of a stylus with the option of international delivery. and then cut down slightly on the ads. honestly i'd probably order it immediately. I love this game!!! And I know most players don't have a stylus which would guarantee longevity of the game. i hope you consider this."", ""Its. Ok..... I lost my phone and got another one. So lost everything on this game even my friends on Draw something. So I'm a very annoyed. I emailed them and they only told me to do things that obviously I already did. I had all the colors and point and everything. Great. I'm not playing it that much anymore. Because they didn't real help me."", 'awesome game. Need more challenging words. Hate the ads.', 'Absolutely riddled with ads! Spend more time watching ads than anything else!', 'ads is ok. but after each ads, it will stuck at getting ready and it is never ready. i have to close the app and open again. it is very irritating.i cannot watch ads for free topics.. because once i close the apps it is gone. can you fix this please? i like to play with my friends but its getting on my nerves.', ""This game use to be great but unfortunately the ads have become more frequent and obnoxious, the x's don't always work and usually end up sending you to the store and on top of that the option to pay to remove ads is gone now you have to invite 5 friends to play and you'll only get 60days ad free...""]"

Ads are intrusive and distracting. Weird irrelevant new features like these little characters you get assigned. Game play is glitchy. I only played 3 rounds since reinstalling and I'm pretty sure at least 2 of the opponents weren't real people. All my previous progress was wiped out from when I used to play before. Ugh. Won't be back."", ""This isn't the game that came out. The game's screwed up with unnecessary features and glitches which closes the app randomly. Not going to complain about the ads because that's what keeps the developers going. But the developers screwed up the app that was simple, elegant and memorable. Now it's just trash with extra features, which is still trash"", ""I played this game when it first came out and I loved it. It's totally different now. You can't complete a full game without spending gems or watching ads. It's so frustrating. I can only answer a few questions before I inevitably get one wrong and am forced to exit because I'm not paying for gems."", ""MY biggest complain is WHY we should give ticket to join an elite tournament. It used to be all about your skill in elite tournament. And it is fair to lose the coin you bet because you will gain twice as much if you win. TO BE FAIR, isn't it logical to get twice the ticket we bet if we win? OR AT THE VERY LEAST, we get the ticket back, in the same amount we bet, IF WE WIN. The added rule to this elite tournament which USED TO BE FAIR to be UNFAIR is just meh"", ""I'm highly disappointed with this game. I used to play quizup earlier and used to love it then but then I had to uninstall it for some reason. I again installed it recently and it has become the worst game ever. I tried multiple times and kept on trying but it kept on showing error and the game did not start even once. Highly disappointed I needed some fun time. I think after these many bad reviews the developer needs to do something about it or may be they don't give a damn now."", 'In addition to this game having become a pale shaddow of what it was in the beggining, it not even works with the latest version. I just log in and a red box appears with ""failed to load config data"". The options are \'try again\' which doen\'t work and \'Quit\'. What a joke. I tried clearing cache and data, reinstall and the same thing. I won\'t miss it given the fact that most of your users have abanoned the game and it\'s mostly bots and ads nowadays the entire app.', 'QuizUp was way better when it didn\'t try to be a social media platform, or have tons of microtranscations for multiple currencies, or have these ""Echelon"" things. I liked how simple the app was. The UI is a mess now. At least the trivia is on point. It would be nice if we could adjust the font size for questions.', ""It used to be a good game until they keep forcing you to open these annoying silver or gold boxes every time you want to play Also they run adverts that block the 'x boxes' forcing you to watch them. It's just really cluttery now Too much clutter. Too many pop ups, boxes to open Keep it simple please. It used to be great. I just want to open my phone and play a quiz without fifty tasks to complete first."", ""I used to play this a few years ago, it was a great app back then! Tried it again (Jan'20) and I couldn't even recognise it! They have massively sold out to advertising, so much that the game is no longer enjoyable. Therefore, I'm sad to say that I have deleted the app in search for something else."", ""A wonderful quiz game. I know how great it was 5 years ago and how many technical issues (and others) there are now. Instead of adding so many ads that cost space,why not ask everybody to pay say 3‚Ç¨? This app is absolutely worth it. I'll gladly support it if the technical glitches will be taken care of. And now these stupid comic figures? Are these supposed to attract 13-year-olds? Believe me,nobody needs these! Instead of wasting time with this nonsense, why not work at the technical issues?"", ""I used to really like this app and played everyday but the new qluzos thingying make the whole game too clunky. I don't like the update. Prefer you to update the questions! Also when are you going to add questions for Season 8 GoT??? Still waiting..... In the past I gave it 5 but not now. No motivation"", ""I've been playing for a while and obviously I'm a quizaholic.... So quiz up is right up my alley! However, there are few things I would like the creators to take note of- when you reach a higher level, it would be nice to have a change in the questions. Some of the questions are extremely repetitive. Also, very often, when being connected to random players, suddenly the other person gets disconnected, and it's extremely irritating when that happens more than once."", 'I used to play on this app for a long time, but ever since I redownloaded it there has been nothing but relentless adds. As a developer myself, I am really disappointed in the developers of this game for allowing it to be so saturated with adverts. Uninstalled.', ""The app is nice. It even has a site version. The only issue is that of updates and adds. It has way too many adds. And you just cannot play it without updating it. Also, there are many bots in it. Like when you don't find anyone to play with, they match you up with bots which is really annoying. Also, the banning stuff. I mean they don't ban people who need to be banned. But they ban those who don't. I've been banned twice, without any reason. Its really annoying! You should fix it!"", ""It's been two years since I had this app, it was better before there were ads. But, ads aside, it's very glitchy now always saying something went wrong. I have the latest update on a galaxy note 10. Doesn't seem to be very many players either which is sad because the trivia is very fun. Not a fan of these monster characters either.... if you like trivia, no matter these subject this app is very fun."", ""Best app for quiz ever played . Includes many topics, hundreds of them are for you to choose from and many many more are for you to choose from. Every topic has its own leaderboard . The best thing is that it's fully free with only some ads which bring points for the player.,"", ""Would have been a 5 but the new idea of opening boxes and building little assistants is a step backwards. Having to stop every 3 games and open a box is pointless and far less appealing than the achievement banners they replaced. As for the adverts i.was happy to.pay to remove them and as you can block opponents you don't wish to interact with I don't find that a problem either."", ""Pay for ad-free 'experience' (like it's netflix); pay for 'entry' tickets (like it's superbowl); pay for 'mining' gems (like the govt. is issuing licenses for extraction of minerals); and then watch a 30-second ad to 'earn' a single, freakin ticket! Either the developers are vying to 'acquire' Google or planning to construct another 'Burj Khalifa!' I wish to gain knowledge and engage in fair competition; not shell out 'green paper' for entering every tournament like it's the Olympics! Sad üòî!"", ""Although the interface is very clean, I was very much pushed back by the numerous ads, the heavy battery drainage and the frustrating fact that every 5 questions you get one about one of three topics which are completely different, and most of the time in which you are much less knowledgeable about. Some questions even are wrong. Yes you can put redstone dust on top of glass blocks in Minecraft, I'm sorry but it is possible."", ""Since Glu has decided to add the nightmarish hybrid of Patrick and Mr. Krabs (if they were caught in a devastating accident,) the whole app has gone downhill. Nobody asked for a squad or for the app to look like teeny-bopper land. The requests were actually add new topics and update existing ones. Now it's more like drive every player with integrity out with the way they keep cramming boosts down our throats."", 'Your app becomes a pile of irrelevant ""s""word... I\'ve played and enjoyed it before... But now it becomes very intriguing... I used to get questions about topics that i\'m interested in, but now it keeps giving me questions about stuff that I didn\'t select in my interest and I\'m not following it (exp: load of questions about the TV show friends and I didn\'t neither select nor follow friends or any other TV shows).im leaving with a conclusion that it becomes designed to make the player loose....', 'I am a purist,so I saw little reason to change, I Loved the ""original"", (to me; circa 2015) so the ""improvements"" came as an unnecessary and unlooked for change, bringing nothing except perhaps the removal of some cheaters... NOT ALL. It is still a good game, though, like the saying goes; ""Too many cooks spoil the broth."" This should be taken seriously into account, lest the whole initial intent of the game goes out the window when the new and improved comes in... (‡≤•_‡≤• = just sick in L.A.)', 'Wow this app went from being one of my favourite apps to a very frustrating one. I love the social aspect of this app as I have made friends through it. I have also paid for no ads and I was enjoying it. But recently the app just keeps crashing and does not start at all. What a shame I had to give a low rating', 'I\'ve been playing this game for years, including beta testing. who felt the need to add ""qluzos""??? completely unnecessary, and distract from the game itself. there\'s too much going on in the app, and it literally didn\'t let me exit the intro to qluzo screen until I restarted the app. very disappointing to return to, and I\'m sorry but I probably won\'t play any more. those things ruin my player aesthetic.', ""Downloaded again after I few years and I mean, honestly what's the point of the characters.. that and the excessive ads are my only complaints, other than that it's still pretty enjoyable. I just have no desire to unlock these monster characters or whatever they are, it's pointless and should just be removed, straight up."", ""It's a shame, this used to be a user-friendly quiz, it's now just another gimmicky app full of distracting powerups and characters who serve no discernable purpose in a pvp quiz setting. Glad to see everyone feels the same about the recent updates."", 'Absolutely stupid. Whenever I open the app after opening it, it works fine. After that, if I open it again, it just crashes every. God. Damn. Time. I have a pixel 2, I have a good internet connection. It just crashes every time. Uninstalled.', 'I really dont like all the extra stuff they added. It slowed the game down and its just very busy. I liked it as a simple triva game. Since all the mascot stuff was added the game kinda went down hill for me.', ""When i tapped on it send me back to my homescreen i couldn't even play it and my phone is a new phone and plus can you fix this bug so i can play or other people can play too if they have this bug and i even tried to uninstall it and install but it still won't work."", ""The last round is too important. I can be in front by two rounds, 40 points, and the oponent can tie it or win it still. It shouldn't count as 2 rounds, but 1,5 rounds maximum, ( 30 points)."", 'It was better before, when ""Echelons"" were not at the game. Also there are too much Ads. Older versions were better because the game tends to be simple, only a trivia, not a social media', 'Used to be great, but now you practically cant play without being bombarded with ads. I get you need to earn money, but jeez an ad after every single round is just annoying, specially in single player. Not to mention the on screen ads.', 'Used to be great. Now you have to watch some trash advert after every quiz as well as having permanent banner ads across the top of the screen. Plus you have to buy currency to play in tournaments so you can have any chance of winning.', ""Everytime i play multiplayer with a certain topic, when it comes to question 5 or 6 THE GAME CRASHED AND KICK ME OUT OF THE BATTLE. I WAS GOING TO WIN AND IT JUST CRASHED. it's not even about my phone. Other games that i played are just fine. I really hope you would find a solution to this dammit."", ""Started fine, set up was easy but as soon as I load in I get disconnected from the game and then I click to open again and it still won't work. Look please fix this I was looking forward to playing with my friends on this."", ""This is a one star because of the wildcard thing. I love the app but I have to remove it because I can't progress in the subjects I'm good at or want to practice because of the wild card that gets me random subjects. This should be an optional thing, not a forced thing."", ""With the new update of the whenever I open my app there is a qluzo cartoon upgrade suggestion and when I click on the next button it doesn't disappear from my page and I am not able to see my page whats the problem with it I have good network connection my phone version and memory is Fine I uninstall the app and reinstall it but the problem is same please suggest me a solution"", ""This game used to be so much fun, but now it is just annoying. The app has gotten cluttered and there's way too much going on for what was once a simple trivia game."", ""It's fun as well as educative ,had a great time playing I still play and learn New things every day. I hope all of you who are looking for an online quiz game should try it Like they say, don't judge a book by its cover. Good luck and have fun while playing. # the silentlove.""]"

I get a question about The Beatles almost every turn. Getting a little sick of it. Would be nice if once we get all the cards from the machines if we could cash in the rest of the gems for more coins or something else. Otherwise they're pointless. Also don't have long answers that we can't read the entire thing of and have to guess what the rest says."", ""I would give it 5 stars except that I paid for the no ad version and still have to close an add trying to sell me coins, credits, or correct answers between EVERY action in the game! I just want to play. I'm never going to spend money on a game. It's obnoxious..."", 'Pros: - There are no outside ads with the paid version Cons: - The questions are sometimes inaccurate or are generalisations that are inaccurate. - There ARE ads to try and get you to purchase in-game advantages. - There are too many interruptions to game play in the form of ads, leaderboard notifications, and other superfluous game information. - Their use of color scheme on buttons is aimed at getting accidental clicks to their ads (this is my speculation and not necessarily fact).', 'I paid for no ads and still have to wait between games to spin some wheel for a prize. It is still asking me to buy coins that I don\'t want. And today I got a notification asking ""are you cheating on me with another game"".', ""Great game and I'm really liking the new ranking league. But I do have a couple comments on the ranking league. I think it would be a great addition if you would add points for winning a challenge. And the limit for points for games won seems to be very inconsistent."", 'i had the game as a higher rating, got a bit boring hadnt played it in a whole week. so i decided to delete and save my money. good idea without the ads! another thing, the questions all get repeated so its like cheating yourself to answer the questions', 'Sometimes when I spin the wheel for a question type in classic mode the question never loads and it\'s stuck ""loading"" I\'m forced to leave the question and forfeit my turn. And somtimes the same thing happens during my ""free stuff spin"" Google pixel 4XL newest version of Android OS', ""It's great. I live survival mode. I have the paid version. Couple of feedback items: the continue/ play button should be more prominent. And many of the questions have odd grammatical construction."", ""Great game and worth paying for no ads but there is far far too much American sports questions in the said category, it's been continuous for days and frankly annoying."", 'Don\'t believe it. It\'s called ""no ads,"" but the truth is, there are TONS of ads, it\'s just that they are for in-game purchases. A total bait-and-switch. I should report them to Google.', 'Just updated and I HATE the layout! Go back to the older version! Ad free? Not any more! Get rid of your pop up ads to buy your stuff! I just want to play.', ""Paid for ad-free version, now I get tons of popup ads for microtransacations. It's not ok to make me click through ads just because it's for your game instead of another."", ""Please lower cost to get turn back. In original I can watch one ad. This is disproportional to the 1000 coins I have to pay in this app. Otherwise it's great."", 'Riddled with interruptions and annoyances. Every round is interrupted by advertisements for in-game items. This game is a case study of greedy and exploitive monetization.', ""Just incredible... Introduction of voice interaction wouldn't hurt.. something close to; Who wants to be a Millionaire.. The popular Quiz TV show..."", ""If I pay for no ads I expect no ads! Your own ads count! Great game though when you don't have all the glitchy pop ups from a money hungry app."", 'Used to be good. No more. I paid for no ads. And while the ads have stopped, after every question, they try and push in-game purchases. No longer a ""quick"" game because of this. Also... what\'s up with quality control for the questions? I am seeing NUMEROUS questions that have wrong answers. This was never the case. Something changed. Back to my other oldie-but-favorite... QUIZ UP.', ""I love this game, but don't like how the ads to buy trivia spins cover the screen every time you start a game"", ""Everything in this app is just a cash grab. It used to be a simple trivia game, but now it's overloaded with extra junk. Also, all of the questions are made by users and are either riddled with spelling and grammatical errors or they are just stupid questions. You can report questions, but I end up having to report every other question for errors."", ""If I didn't have the ad free version, I would not enjoy this as much. But it's fun when you don't have ads :D"", 'I paid for the ad free version as it was cheap and I hate having to view ads. I figured this would be a good idea but I found out it was a COMPLETE WASTE of money. Its true, you no longer have to view ads between games which is nice, however after every single turn you complete the Game gives you a ""free"" spin where you get a low value ""Prize"". These prizes do not appeal to me at all and I have to skip them by pressing a big ""X"" then another PAY TO SPIN thing appears that I have to exit as well.', 'I absolutely love this game. However, after most recent update (12/3 & 12/5) experiencing same ""check internet connection"" message many others are seeing. I am unable to use this at all. Once issue is fixed, I will update review, but not until. This is not the first time issues have rendered the app unusable and it is a bit beyond frustrating.', 'Making it too easy to make accidental purchases! I loved this game but after every turn it asks me if I want to spend $12. I don\'t have this game to spend real money. It would take only 2 taps to spend money if you have a card on file. I deleted my payment information just because of this. I already paid to not see the ads and now all I see is ""buy this"" anyway.', 'Bought the ad free version as I liked the game so much. Now constantly have an annoying pig where you can purchase something extra. Most annoying however is the spinning wheel popping up, making it easy to make an accidental purchase. Which I did last night. I could not find a way to cancel this purchase. The annoyance of this will now have me uninstalling the game to avoid a further wasting of my money. Super disappointed.', ""I loved this game until my last update. Now it won't even let me into the game, I get a check internet connection message. Been this was for 4 days now, so I'm losing out on survivor, playing with my friends fairly, and my bonus points and such. VERY FRUSTRATING!! Ready to quit the game and find a new game that works!"", ""Even though you pay for the game to not have ads, they constantly push micro purchases on you which hinders game play. As well if the game has a new mode (currently lunar New year missions) it will come into the foreground of the app until you 'x' it out and that will eat into your time if you're playing a game, which are times mind you."", 'I really enjoy this game, I purchased the no ads game so I can play. For about a month now everytime I try to play survival, it says there is an error or it gives me 20 seconds to answer a survival question. I can be in the middle of the game with just me and another person left and it errors. Not only does it do that, but it takes my turns.', 'Great game and great customer service. Had an issue and they emailed me back right away.', 'I have the ad free version. I love the game but I have 3 major issues with this app. First, they push annoying notifications every 2 hours, during the day. Not your turn notifications, but other annoying ones. 2nd, they brought back that annoying floating pig. 3rd issue is at the end, they added a spin wheel that says ""Spin for $9.99"". Is this really neccessary to get us to pay more money? I am seriously considering uninstalling this app.', ""I paid money so I wouldn't see ads, but now after every turn I have to click through popups trying to get me to spend more money. I bought this game because in the free version the ads are so annoying, but this one is still annoying. If they don't fix it soon I will delete. Also I hate that pig, it interupts game play."", ""Thnx for bringing back the cards!!.. Pls understand that most of the people playing this version are old customers, who fell in love with the game as it used to be.. We do appreciate some of the new features, but we want back the ones that were taken away, like the playing spins, frames, etc.. We are actually investing money in this game.. It should be way better compared to the free version, & not just one 'with less ads'.. Pls fix issues, & let us have what we want!! .. Thnx & Happy New Year!!"", ""It's a good game, very informative. However, the option to create challenge games with your friends disappeared a long time ago and I wish you'd bring it back. That was a fun way to use the game. And dang it, please get rid of the piggy bank on the screen! It's in the way of other items you need to see!"", 'Ad free. No longer fun. Same complaints as everyone else. Lost a hat I purchased with an upgrade. Many questions don\'t make sense as they are poorly worded. I enjoy trivia but am not really interested in playing against others. Seems ridiculous to allow folks to purchase the correct answer, eliminate 2 possible answers, get a whole new question etc. I still played when bored, waiting for an appointment etc but now the app won\'t open at all. All I get isthe ""check internet connection"" error.', ""Stop trying to sell to me! I used to enjoy this game so much that I bought the ad free version. But now every time i turn on the game they pop up a screen to sell something to me. I know where their store is and I don't need or want to be reminded of it. They finally moved that annoying piggy bank that was in the way but having to click no to their ads when I start playing and after EVERY SINGLE round is ridiculous. I no longer start and games and only play if my daughter sends me one."", 'At one time this was a fun and interesting trivia game.. The last month or so the game has completely changed around.. about 10% of the time the questions are either misspelled or the ""facts"" are nothing more than someone\'s uneducated opinion.. The updates are hit and miss.. they work for a day or two then crash.. I think they would screw up a wet dream..', 'Great game. Definitely worth spending the money to remove the ads', ""1 star for : check the internet connection even when i am connected to the wifi/mobile data When i collect all 3 cards, the double reward button shows up but does nothing, is it there for decoration? if yes, remove it please, it's annoying. also please remove the piggy bank, nobody is gonna open it for 16$ and the button is big and uses a lot of space for nothing. Edit : game updated on the 2nd and on the 3rd of December and the problem about the internet connection is still not fixed."", 'I am never ""Feeling Lucky?""! Please stop forcing us to view this after every round. Allow us to opt out of it showing up every fracking time I finish a round! It is just a feeble attempt to get people to accidentally click on it and spend $10. I paid for the NO ADS app and yet this ad to buy something keeps being displayed. I shouldn\'t have to click-thru Trivia Crack ads! Also, why have a ""Double Reward"" button only show up AFTER you collect from your 3 cards only to say ""nothing to collect""?', ""I've been playing Trivia Crack for sometime. Tues, it stopped working. It says it cannot connect to the internet. My internet is fine. I emailed Trivia Crack and have yet to hear from them. I noticed other people are having the same issues."", ""You keep changing the way the game looks. It was good. Now you changed back to the old version and now the survival game has the same 4210 error codes AGAIN! And now I'm getting an error code of 4302 when trying to play the regular games.""]"

With over 360 puzzles spread over 30 chapters, this game is sure to pull you in.
Best played with friends and family together. You will rediscover the delight and joy in solving puzzles together - huddled around a small screen for hours together with mesmerizing music.

In the beginning, human beings communicated only using symbols.
Language complicated things. Suddenly, there were many words to describe the same idea.

Think attempts to slowly teach the player to think visually and uses these learnings to construct more complicated ideas further into the game. Can you take a look at a bunch of images and figure out what ideas we are trying to communicate?

The game uses a smart, contextually aware hint system and AI which will guide you to the correct answer - instead of just opening out few letters on the keyboard as most other games do. You will find yourself having delightful conversations with the game and trying out various combinations - just to elicit a response from the AI.

To complement the beautiful visuals, the game features music by award winning composer Jim Guthrie (Indie Game the Movie and Sword & Sorcery).

Some puzzles dont always make sense but the hints help when you get stuck. Cant wait for more chapters.....', 'This game is not complex in a fun way...its a cute concept but some of the illustrations seemed intentionally obtuse at times. And certain categories like simple sentences at the end where the solution was ""breathe in the magic"" nobody says that. Oh or icons and the picture was of Tesla. A long way from being iconic, thank you, especially since it\'s not his likeness that will ever be iconic.. at best he can hope that his cars will be, someday', ""A good game but some of the questions are a little too seperate from the clues. Watch out for the americanisms, it wouldn't always reconise correct answers because they weren't spelt or phrased 'american'. I would also prefer if I could skip and come back to a question, rather that being stuck. Be aware you only get three free hints before having to pay for them, although you will find most answers online."", 'I think it really pushes your ability to think out of the box and even increases your vocabulary and generic English knowledge.

Uninstall.', 'Fun game. Some clues are not too helpful, so suggestions are overly helpful. Some drawings are vague, and I needed online help to solve them as I ran out of hints.

My only issue is the points system need improvement. There should be bonus points for guessing all the answers without an error or hints. I can see the similarities between this and family feud. It would also be great if there was a bonus round to guess the answers under a certain amount of time like 2 minutes, for example.', ""It's a good game and all, but some of the answers are a bit questionable. Like for example why is it that IOS gets to have ruler for the question things you find in a pencil case but Android has to say crayons? Never find that in a pencil case since they come in separate boxes or school supplies them? Kids find more interest in textars, markers, coloured pencils than crayons.

I enjoy that concept, but wow, some of the answers just show how dull-brained some people are. Many make sense, but sometimes you got a few wild cards that make you think the devs surveryed middle school dropouts. On top of that, correct answers aren\'t always accepted until after I\'ve spent 30-90 coins, and some answers are just lumped into one that make no sense (I\'m looking at you, ""Makeup"" sublevel).

But i cant see what quizzes iv'e completed??"", ""It's excellent for its research and photos. BUT it's also very frustrating. You should allow players to repeat a pack (without point scoring).

Beautiful pictures!', 'I opened all packs I saved 1500 points.

So if you don't like this game I hope you will change you mind based on my review. #AWSOME"", ""The game is fun but the maker needs to use a different source for the logos' back stories. We all know that Wikipedia isn't very reliable and the back story for who founded McDonald's is no exception."", 'It\'s fun, but a lot of the logos are really area-specific, I get the feeling they looked at other logo quiz games and just raided the Canadian-themed levels and such.

Level 26 has arrived! ü§©,"[""It's great. There are also other great movies and TV series that you can add. I'll give you some as a suggestion for next levels. The Goonies The Sandlot Frozen The House With a Clock In Its Walls The Land Before Time The Princess and the Frog Barney Family Guy Hannah Montana The Peanuts Hoosiers Killer Klowns from Outer Space Norbit Monster House Coraline Home Improvement National Lampoon's Camp Rock High School Musical Richie Rich Percy Jackson Oscar Annie Fiddler on the Roof"", ""Good fun. Good idea. Incredibly hard, with some obscure clues. This game is a must for movie fanatics. It'll have you guessing forever. Like I said, you have to know your movies for this game. If you're not a movie buff, you won't get very far."", ""Enjoyable. You're not overwhelmed with ads every time the screen changes. It could use more explanation of game play. And I don't see a counter for hints."", ""It was great for a few days, i had 21 leavels unlocked and some at 100%. Then I come back today and all levels are locked except 1-4 which were all 100% but I had other levels at 100% so its totally unfair I'm unistalling NOW"", 'brilliant, a game with a difference. hard but not so hard you feel stupid just hard enough to get the old brain ticking.', ""Fun game, but couldn't give it a great review because it was so short. Blew through it in an afternoon."", 'Great game. Almost all pictures are great hints. Not difficult to win hints and they are helpful. You can beat levels easily, even without hints.', ""It's fun. I was a little confused when tv shows popped up, but it's still great. A great way to pass time while waiting at the Dr or something."", 'New to game. Just learning that its not always a movie sometimes a tv program. Seems fun trying to get used to it.', ""I have'nt played this app very much. However, I have enjoyed what I've played. Thank You for an enjoyable FREE game."", 'Great game for a movie fanatic like me, but not as easy as it looks. Coodos and two thumbs up! PJ', ""I haven't found a movie trivia app yet that's very well thought out, interesting or well executed, this one is no different, par for the course."", 'Fun to work through, need to look at them more than once to figure them out!', 'Challenging without many of those annoying adverts between each answer! Great quiz', 'They game started easy enough but i find myself using more hints than i thought...great game!!!', 'Great but too short. Finished it in less than 6 hours.', ""In the latest update.. for 'l√©on: the professional' there's no 'i' in the options.. please fix it"", 'A game that makes you think and is fun, its my kind of game. Play it and enjoy!', 'Kind of hard. The pictures could be more detailed but all and all pretty fun and challenging.', 'Not as easy as it looks. Graphics could be better.', 'Fun. Challenging, but not too difficult.', 'I purchased this game back in the day but now notice it has ads, very disappointed', 'Picture tiles need to be larger too hard to see', 'Challenging ! Great stimulus for movie buffs. Has the potenntial to be addictive', 'Like it. And so far, not many ads', 'Great addictive app. Great app for long journeys.', ""It's okay, but it'll trick me by mixing shows in there, and since I only watch a handful of shows, I usually get it completely wrong. It also has quite a few foreign films, which is fine, though one issue I have is when I do know the name, I end up spelling it wrong because it's in a different language. üò∞ Overall, it's worth wasting a few minutes every now and then."", 'Illustrations are often way too obscure.', ""Great game, tolerable ads and not a lot of pressure to buy hints if you're a decent film buff. Only downside is I finished all the current levels in less than a week of playing off and on. Certainly addictive."", ""Fun, addictive game. Good assortment of movies, from new ones to old ones. I don't have a lot of money, so it's nice to be able to earn hints instead of being forced to purchase them. Some of the clues are easy and some really make you think, so gets your brain and imagination working. Interface is nice and simple, so it's easy to cruise through. In my opinion, this is a super fun little game! Keep those levels coming, I'm anxiously awaiting the next set to come out. Thanks, creators!"", ""It's alright, not enough levels. once completed, (which movie buffs will do pretty quickly) you're stuck waiting to do a single daily question. * small letters makes spelling mistakes happen more than they should."", ""The wheel that gives you free spin points, doesn't seem to be randomly spun? It seems to always give you the least points, ( never stops on anything higher than 3 ,so far). Annoying that you can't play it entirely offline. Even though your next pack is achieved, unless you open it b4 going offline, it won't let you play till back online. Some of the categories are a bit obscure, foreign films? It's pretty good otherwise"", 'I like the idea of the game. However, the tiles are too small for the letters that are on them. The bottom part of the letters are cut off, so it makes it difficult to know whether you are choosing the right letter.', 'Just started playing. No issues yet.', 'Game was fun, but, way to easy. It only took me a few days to beat all 25 levels. I do watch a lot of movies though. Hopefully they add more levels.', 'Was enjoying the game, now unplayable as have been locked out of future levels and have already completed the previous ones. Game claims I must complete 20 questions to upgrade to level 4 (though I was previously level 12) although all questions have already been correctly answered. Shame, I really did enjoy the game, not just simple famous movies, contained some trickier questions which I liked as it kept me engaged. Hope this is fixed soon :)', 'Fun but bad graphic set up. The letters I, L E and others are cut off due to the ad banner on the bottom. Let me buy it I will because other than not knowing which lettet you are using it is a good game.', ""Really great game. Doesn't cost anything. Lots of hints and tips. If you get stuck you can move on and return later. Love it!"", ""Great concept but way too easy. Some images are exactly the movie poster, but without the name. And sometimes the answer is a serie... It's called movie quiz for a reason... Right?"", 'I really enjoy this game. All levels from easy to difficult are fun. It is quite easy to earn points although the wheel is faulty since it was changed, as it often pays out on a lower number than should and the gaps are far too narrow. A small fixable annoyance for a fantastic game of skill. please keep the new levels coming.']"
